Listen, pep talk. Big day today. It's our grand re-re-re-opening. It's labor day weekend, And it looks like wonder wharf is getting mobbed. So we have to-- Big day for another reason, too! Linda, I'm in the middle of my pep talk. Go ahead, sorry. Go ahead, do your pep. So we have to sell some burgers. [fart noise] Every year, this weekend Makes or breaks us. Who's farting? It's gene's sound effects thing. I thought that made you sound like a robot. It does robot voice, laser sound, And fart noise. [fart noise] Oh, god. Listen, your mother and I Have to go downstairs and grind the meat. But you kids know where you're supposed to be while we're gone, right? Tina, you're on the grill. My crotch is itchy. All: Oh! Ok. Are you telling me as my daughter, Or as my grill cook? Um, as... Because my grill cook would never tell me that. Oh. Also, my daughter Should probably not say anything like that to me. Tell her. Tell your mom. My crotch is itchy. Come here, let me see. Linda. Not now. No, let's all see it. No. I'm just not sure if I'll be any good on the grill With just one free hand. Ok, I'm just going to keep moving here. Louise, you're working the counter. I put your little step stool back here. But do not alter anything on the chalkboard. Well, what if I think of something better? Which would be almost impossible not to do. You will not think of something better, Because "new bacon-ings" is perfect. It's hilarious. Right? You know what, I'm taking the chalk. Like I don't have chalk. Gene, you're outside, nicely offering people A free sample, all right? I'm on it! But people coming out of the crematorium next door; People obviously in mourning... Yeah? Don't offer them samples. Dad, when I'm in character out there, I get in a zone! I can't keep track of who's in mourning and who isn't. Just anyone with an urn... Yeah? Leave 'em alone! I know you think it's the gene show out there, But there's a line between entertaining and annoying. No! That's a myth. [laser sounds] [fart sounds] All right, listen. You're my children and I love you. But you're all terrible at what you do here, And I feel like I should tell you, I'd fire all of you if I could. Bob! All right, hands in. Don't--tina, don't put your hand in. Tina: What... All right. Sell some burgers! All, softly: Sell some burgers. [crying] Bob's burgers! [robot voice] free sample! [laser noise] Come and get it. [fart noise] [fart noise] Aahh! I don't like leaving the kids alone up there for this long. Something bad's gonna happen. Bob, they're fine. Please, I asked you a question. Yes, what was the question? Do you remember our wedding night? Yes. We worked 'cause we couldn't afford not to. I remember. You know you're grinding too fast. Slow down. What was the date? The date? Yes, the date of our wedding! I don't know. Oh, crap. Is it today? Yes, bob! Today's our anniversary. Yes, it is! I'm sorry. Baby, I'm sorry. I'm not good with dates, you know that. Today's your birthday? Yes, bob! Today's my birthday? Yes, bob! Your due date was today? Yes, bob! How'd it go? How do you think it-- good. It went very well. That's good. Boy or girl? Where you going? I'm done! I said I'm sorry. Bob, I'm done! Linda, come back. We need to finish grinding the hamburger. Man: Oh, my god, gross. Thank you. [robot voice] Free samples. Hey, you can't give out those samples. You just dropped them on the ground. Shh! What are you, the dropping food on the ground police? Yes. Oh. They have that? Yes. I'm the health inspector. The what? [robot voice] Health inspector. Off. What? Health inspector! The burger joint's natural enemy. Hello. Welcome to bob's burgers. The burger of the day is the child molester. It comes with candy. Get it? Yes. No. 'cause sometimes they use candy To lure their victims-- Yes, we get it. Ohh. Is this your parents' place? Yes, they're down in the basement Grinding the meat right now. Uh-huh. That's not a euphemism. They're really grinding the meat. Show us the kitchen, please. I'm just saying, it's easy to remember our anniversary. It's September third. 9/3. 9 is divisible by 3. What? That's not-- A lot of numbers are divisible by 3. Don't argue with me. All right, you're right, 9 is divisible by 3, And now I'll remember. [gasps] oh, my god. Are you messing with me? What? What are you--no. You are. I-- you are! Lin, I forgot. I am sorry. I said I'm sorry. And I'm going to make it up to you. I can see you smiling. I'm not smiling! You're smiling with your eyes. What is it? What are you doing? A party?! Why are you doing this? Is it a party upstairs?! No, linda, can you please just finish this? I gotta get back up there. Oh! To get everything ready for the party? No! To get everything ready for lunch, In our restaurant, the one we're trying to save, remember? Go ahead. Go. Call me to come up when it's all ready. I'll act surprised, like this-- [gasps] ahh! That's-- ohh! I almost had a heart attack! That's scared, that's not surprised. Ahhh! That's like you hurt yourself. Ahhh-ahhh! That's good. Smell this. Doesn't it smell like strawberries? [sniffs] ugh! Gotcha. It's spoiled milk, dummy. So you're the health inspector? Yes. 'cause I think I have some kind of rash or something. I'm not that kind of health inspector. Rashy grill cook. [toilet flushes] You have no idea What I've just been through. Do I have any toilet paper stuck to my buns? [fart noise] Where are the grown-ups?! [door opens] Aha! You must be bob. Uh, who are you? We're from the health inspectors office. I'm hugo, this is my partner ron. I don't have a badge yet. I just started. [fart noise] Give me that. Come on! Bob, this is my violations notebook. I just filled it. It took 5 minutes in your kitchen. Uh, that sounds bad. It's a record. [kids cheering] Shut up. Not to mention child labor law violations, Public decency violations-- Public decency? What--what are you talking about? The child molester? I thought this was a family restaurant. Uh, what's the child molester? It's the burger of the day. No, it's not. For a limited time only. Till you came back upstairs. Did someone actually order this? Yeah. Who? Him. Huh. He looks like a child molester. Louise, don't serve him. Let gene bring it. Uh, bob-- Why do I have to get m*lest*d? Because he's not going to molest you. Why? Because you're heavy. Bob-- yeah, hold on. Heavy kids can get m*lest*d! Yeah, who wouldn't want to molest this face? That's enough. It's not that. Bob-- I mean, gene, 'cause you're older. Tina's the oldest. Make her do it. Yeah, but tina's not good with the customers. Bob-- I'm good with the customers. No. No. Mmm, not really. I'm great with the customers. Mmm. Mm-mmm. She's autistic, she can't help it. Yeah, I'm autistic. Bob-- just a sec. No, you're not autistic, tina. How many toothpicks on the ground? Don't play this game again. Come on. How many toothpicks? No. It just involves me cleaning up toothpicks. A hundred? Bob! No. A hundred? It's three! There's three! Ok, ok, how many now? Bob! Three. Both: No! Ugh, you're the worst kind of autistic. You can't even count. Bob! You want to know why we're here? Because I'll tell you, it's not for a routine inspection. It's not? No. We're investigating a very disturbing rumor. There's a rumor you make your burgers With human remains from the crematorium next door! Hmm. I wonder how a rumor like that gets started. It's made with human remains From the crematorium next door. [all gasping] Who knows? Kids say crazy stuff. Here's what's gonna happen. We'll test your meat. If it contains human flesh Anything above the 4% allowable by the fda, Then your restaurant will be closed, And you, sir, will be going to jail. Oh, a party for me! Oh. Hugo? Linda? What are you doing here? I'm the health inspector. I just transferred here. [gasps] What are you doing here? This is our restaurant. We own it. You're married to him? How do you two know each other? I thought you ran off with bob, The hot sh*t restaurateur . I did. Oh, god. You did? I'm on it. Yeah, I don't think so! I can't believe-- I can't-- I-- I can't believe you left me for him! You left someone for me? Ugh! He doesn't even know? We were--we were briefly engaged. [all gasping] I still remember the day I heard you were getting married. Oh, my god. Is today your anniversary? Yes! How do you remember that? It's 9-3. 9 is divisible by 3. That doesn't make sense! A lot of numbers are divisible by 3. Well, happy anniversary. Human flesh?! Wait, wait, wait, wait. This is one of our biggest weekends. You can't put that up. Nobody will eat here. Prominently displayed. Well, then just do your tests, pal, because it's beef. Sorry! The lab's closed till Monday. You'll get your test results then. Consider yourself health inspectored! [screaming] I--I'd try it. There's no wait. Hello, how are you? Come in and have a burger. A perfectly normal burger. Best burger in town. [screaming] Did your father say anything About an anniversary present? Kids: No. Nothing? Like maybe hiding a necklace In a hamburger, Or hiding some earrings down the drain, Or something romantic like that? That's romantic? Yeah! Yeah. Did you check the toilet or in the garbage? Ahh. Gene, get off. You're choking me. Whee! You're choking me! [screaming] So is hugo going to put dad in jail Because you dumped him? No. Hugo is going to put your father in jail Because your sister Told her class that we serve human flesh. Now why would you do something like that, honey? Why? I'll tell you why, mom! Anita vasquez's uncle is a matador in Spain. She was showing everybody his cape. I had to up the ante, And what do I have to show for show and tell? I got nothing, mom! Calm down. There's nothing here to show! Louise... What?! Tina, stop. [screaming] Mom, you can get hugo to take down the sign. How am I supposed to do that? He's madly in love with you. Work it, woman. Yeah. [groans] 

  [hugo crying] ["never gonna give you up" playing on cell phone] Hello? Linda?! Bob: It's our big weekend. I mean, this grill should be covered with burgers right now. Who's that for? Mort. He called in his order. He doesn't want to be seen here, So I'm sending gene over to the crematorium with it. [bell rings] Right. So hugo is coming over. To talk. To me. What? Don't be mad. I think I can talk him out of it, All of this. And when you say "talk him out of it," what does that mean? Is hugo going to be our new dad? Oh, please. Just checking. Maybe I should help you set the mood. Put out some candles. Ooh, candles! Ugh, unbelievable. Bob's burgers delivery service! Shh, shh, shh, shh! Quick! Why'd you ever get engaged to that guy, anyway? Ahh, I was young. And my parents liked him Because he always did the dishes. Yeah, I bet. Ha! Also, he-- He used to... What? He, uh, he happened to be an excellent kisser. What--an excellent kisser? Yeah. He was very soft, And he didn't have a lot of moisture. Like some people. Like some people? You think I'm a bad kisser? No... Oh, yeah, well, how about this? Oh--oh. Are you sweating? Uh, no. Is that my saliva? Don't be mad! Oh, no, I'm not. Not at all! Bob! I better go, all right? I'd hate to get any saliva on you And mr. Perfect moisture mouth! I happen to produce a lot of saliva, linda! So! You're the health inspector, huh? How did that happ-- I want to read you this poem. En. "inspector of health, Inspector of pain." um... "I came in search of human remains, "and I found a piece of human flesh I thought I'd never see again--my heart." Mm-hmm. Very nice! Uh, hugo, you know bob's not a cannibal, right? I don't know that. Don't do this. I'm sorry I hurt you-- Linda! I can save you from all this! Wow. A candy coffin. Customized caskets and urns, that's our specialty. That's mr. Caffrey Of the caffrey toffee company. It's on the lift 'cause they're coming To pick 'em up this afternoon. I need more condiments. Don't touch anything and don't press any buttons. Oh, my god! It's bob anniversary present, he remembered! Aww. This is so exciting. It's a dead body! Maybe the present's underneath. You're on a sinking ship, lady. And you better get off before the ship sinks! Hello, the media? [all shouting] [clapping] Good job, everybody. An angry mob, That's just what we wanted outside our restaurant. They're over there, in their little van, Inspecting themselves. [indistinct] Do you think I should change where I part my hair? Uh, let me see. Uh, yes? Can you open the window a little more? I'm not going to assault you. Don't touch me! Sorry. That just came over me. Listen, I came out to ask you to talk to this crowd. I mean, you made an angry mob here. Huh. Hey, what's all this stuff? You got a whole chemistry lab back there. Can't you do the test here, Instead of ruining my weekend? Don't tell me how to do my job. I don't tell you how to grow your corpses. Come here. Aah! No! Let go of me! Good luck with the angry mob, bob! Uh, how close am I to that car? You want me to help you get out of your spot? Yeah! I can't see his bumper? Am I close? No, you got room. Keep coming. Keep coming. Stop. How am I doing in front? It's tight. Keep comin'. All right, cut the wheel. Cut the wheel! I am, I am, I'm cutting it. You gotta cut hard right when you-- Just get out, I'll do it. Oh, my god. Bob's confronting the crowd. I'm going out there. You kids stay inside. Hey, people! This is crazy. We're being smeared by an unstable health inspector For personal reasons. We know you people, and you know us. You, you're the shoe repair guy. Nope. Locksmith. I mean the locksmith, the locksmith. I had keys made by you. So? That was...Great, right? Hmm. Fair. All: Boo! No, no, no booing. No booing mort. You know him, too. He's one of us. This guy has been here forever. Ever since I got run out of bog harbor. What? Why'd you get run out of bog harbor? For selling human flesh to the restaurants. [all gasping] Ha ha, I'm kidding, people! Come on. [all chuckling] Hey, the subject of d*ath makes us all uncomfortable, Except mort. But what about how we treat the living? 'cause sometimes we end up treating those bodies Better than we treat these bodies. We break each other's hearts. We forget important dates. We write hurtful things on poster board. We mistreat the living and no one seems to care. But once that body's dead, It's, "hey, don't mistreat the dead body! "hey, don't eat the dead body!" That's the ultimate crime, right? m*rder, no big deal. Cannibal? Whoa! Is he defending cannibalism? No, I'm just saying-- cannibal! See, that's a new jersey-- damn cannibal! Folks, please, I'm trying--no. Cannibals! That's not what I mean! He's gonna eat us! [distorted yelling] Oh, thank god it didn't break. Dad, dad! Forget it. Never mind. Nada. No longer relevant. He's right, isn't he? We can test this meat right here In the mobile lab, can't we? We liquefy it, add the enzyme. If it's yella, salmonella, If it's chartreuse, it's a deuce, And if it's blue, it's your aunt sue. I know, ron! I know the rhyme! Don't you think I know the rhyme?! It doesn't matter. Don't you see, he's guilty. If it's not human flesh, it's something else. It's dirty hand towels. It's--it's something else! Stealing your woman? Nuhh! Ugh. Shut up, shut up, shut up! [sobbing] Oh, ok, that's it, that's it. Let it out. Let it out. [bob sighs] You're a failure. You failed. You fail at everything. You fail at marriage. You fail at family. Your kids are failures. And you're fat. You're not attractive. You never were. Well, you were a little bit, when you were a teenager. But then you got fat. What is he saying out there? He's talking to the restaurant, mom. Bobby, stop talking to the restaurant and come inside. Leave me alone! Bob, come inside. Come on. Bob, come on. Bobby. What's the use?! Dad? This is louise, your daughter. Yes, louise. What? I'm sorry that I told everyone That we make burgers from human remains. [sighs] ok, louise. Thank you. Dad, it's gene. Yes, gene, go ahead. Dad? Yes! I think we have a bad connection. I'll call you back. Oh, my god. I want to talk to him, too. I can hear you. It's just glass. Oh. [sniffs] Now my rash smells like bacon. And it doesn't itch anymore. I think we're going to be ok. Ok, tina, thank you. Louise: Dad, is the restaurant going to close? [sighs] I don't know, louise. We're almost broke. The whole town thinks we're cannibals, And I forgot our anniversary. You'd have been better off with hugo, linda. Bob, please. No, it's true. I can't even satisfy you with my kisses. Sorry, kids. No problem. Thanks for the info. Oh, bobby! Now you listen to me. I would rather be married To a suspected cannibal with a dream like you Than a soft-lipped guy Who never had a dream in the first place. You would? No question. You're a hero to your kids and to me. Now come inside. Come inside And make us some food. We're hungry. I'm in. I'm comin' in. [kids chuckling] Open the door. Ha ha. Open the door. Seriously, open the door! Kids, let your father in the restaurant, please. Let me in! Still serving human flesh. No. Yes! No! We have kind of an adventurous eaters club. We like to try new things. Can you seat 25 people? Oh, uh...Well, we might have Some more human meat, but it's, uh, $50 a burger. That's a deal. Really--what? Really? Great. [chuckles] let's do it. Hello. Welcome. Human flesh right this way. Uh, hi. Uh, hugo wanted to give you this. It states clearly that there was no human flesh in-- Shh! Shh. Yes, yes. Thank you. Thanks. We were able to expedite the tests, And we found 100% grade a beef-- shh, shh! Ron! I'm just sorry-- Shut up! Shut up. Ok. Hi. Welcome. Linda, I can't believe how much money we just made. This turned into a great weekend. Oh, bob, it's gorgeous. Hmm. We seem to have stopped. Ahh. Bobby! You've been practicing. Yeah. I went online, got some tips. They have kissing tips online? I learned a few moves. Check this one out. This one is your anniversary gift. [both giggling] Oh, bobby! Go, bob! Ugh, unbelievable. Aww, sick! Mom's really handsy. You're a couple of sluts! I think it's nice. Hey! Get this thing movin'! I'm getting scarred for life up here!
[plays back chewing] Gene. [adds reverb] Gene. Gene. [burps] what? Stop. Bob, no more newspaper, please. My parents are gonna be here any minute. I know. You know how I know they're coming? Because you go into a crazy cleaning frenzy every time. It's like the way animals freak out before an earthquake. That's nice. That's not true. She's spooked. Louise, you're gettin' cereal everywhere. I'm having a seizure! Put a wallet in my mouth! It passed. Look at this place. It's a disaster. You haven't even fixed the leak yet. Come on. Linda, the leak is contained. Bobby! What? You barely notice those. Aah! I'm ok. Trust me, Bobby. My mother will notice that our ceiling is leaking. [sighs] Yeah, you're right. She will, repeatedly and loudly. Just fix it, please. Be my All-American fix-it man, Bobby. Fine. I'll go up to the attic and fix the leak. But I also need you and the kids to work out Whose room my folks are sleepin' in, Because I have to go check the bathroom for stray hairs. No one sheds like this family. It's like a bunch of chewbaccas. So where are grandma and grandpa gonna sleep? Gene's room smells like farts. That makes sense. Great. Well, we'll put 'em in there, then. Maybe they'll leave sooner when they smell farts. Yeah. Gene can sleep with me in my room As long as he doesn't mind my night terrors. Huh? Remember, you let me watch "night of the living dead" when I was 8, So now I wake up every night standing in the middle of my room, Scratching the air, and kicking. Oh, good. Wait. You still get those? Yeah. They're weirder now. Oh, boy. I think my subconscious fears and my budding sexuality Are getting all mixed up. Ok, I--Tina, I don't want to hear it. So I think I'm being attacked by zombies, And I start screaming, "do you wanna make out?" And I make out with it. Hmm. I might just bunk with Gram and Gramps. Ok, enough. Gene, Louise, you sleep in Tina's room. Tina, you're quarantined. You sleep alone. We'll strap you down or something. Leave my lips free. Hey. Hey! Gene, just 'cause grandma and grandpa are comin', Doesn't mean you're gonna get out of doin' homework. How far are you on that history report? So far, I just got the title-- "history: A blast from the past." Ok. After we get my parents settled, Your father's gonna help you with that. Right, bob? Have it on my desk by 5:00. I am not writing your report for you. Hey! Ok, everybody, I have an announcement to make. I am on a ladder. Stop shaking it. I feel like I shouldn't have to say that. Dad, why do you get so mad when grandma Gloria And grandpa al come over to visit? Do you hate them? I don't hate them. Just grandma. Or I don't hate her, just the sound she makes And her voice and the things she says. Agh! Al! [all gasp] [clears throat] [sighs] Wanna hear my impression of her? Yes. Al! Linda: I'm not hearing this, right? Sorry. I mean, she's your Gram Gram. We love her. [whispering] We hate her. I fixed the leak! Good! Don't stay up there too long, 'cause I wanna sorta have a nice visit Before we open the restaurant! Uh, I mean, almost done! Huh? Wow. This is amazing. Eh, whose room am I behind?! Tina: Mine. Hi, Tina. Are you in the wall or in my horse poster? Please say, "horse poster." I'm a horse. [neighs] Oh, wait. I can go sideways, too. Are you in another dimension? Do you see a lion or a witch or a wardrobe? A what? A lion, a witch, or a wardrobe! Why are you saying that, Gene? It's a book. Oh, right, right. A kid's book. Yeah. Yeah, by salman rushdie. It's not by salman rushdie. Of course it is. It isn't. Yes, it is. I'm not gonna talk to you anymore, Gene. I'm in a wall. Go look it up, though. I just did. It's salman rushdie. [doorbell rings] Linda: They're here! Bob, come out of the wall, please! Yeah. Hello! Al! Oh, my god. Don't leave our bags out there on the street. Are you crazy?

You're never gonna believe this. What is it? What? I'm stuck! [fanfare plays] [sniffs] Shouldn't have farted. Gloria: Who's trapped in the wall? Bob. Bob: Me. Bob can't fit in the wall. He's overweight. Mom. What? He can't hear me. Yes, I can. I'm right here. I'd like to order a hamburger. No, al! He can't have a hamburger. He can have a turkey burger. There's no such thing as a turkey burger. Go read your "maxim." Dad gets "maxim"? No. He found it in the recycling at the condo. Who's on the cover? The girls of "coyote ugly." I don't think they're even alive anymore. Lin, we need to open the restaurant. Hey, I bet I can get down there. What are you talking about? You can go down? Kids, you meet me down there, ok? You're gonna be my eyes and my hands. Ok. We're down there. No, you're not. You haven't moved! I'm turning on the grill! Beep boop. Whoosh! That's not the sound the grill makes.

Are you very, very busy today? Uh, no. You're in a tight spot, huh, Bobby? A little bit, Teddy. Ehh. I've heard of buildings like this, you know, With false walls. Uh-huh. It's a prohibition thing.

So if you don't have kids, I don't think you know enough To be calling in anyone. In fact, I don't think you come out Looking so good here yourself. I wonder if you even got permission from the school To come over here today. He didn't. He took us away from learning! We were in the car with Mr. Frond, And he didn't make us wear seat belts. What?! [stammers] How about you put your phone and your little notebook Back in your pocket there and leave this family alone! Heh. Ok. All right. All right. All right. All right. Gloria, thank you.

I wanna put a stick of dynamite in it And blow it up! No. What is wrong with all of you? No one's touching this meat but me. I have an announcement, too. My bra is chafing me. That's not a real announcement. Oh! I have one. I love... House music. There! I said it! [imitating house beat] And I'm going to get my g*n license, Finally. Oh, congratulations. Can't believe they're making you wait 3 days. Stop stealing my thunder! I found the banner! It's from our old printer. You just have to tear off the holes on the side. We were supposed to hit 100,000 ages ago. Heh. We were way off. Yeah. Big time. Ha hah! Can I just-- stop it! Tina: There it is. Get it! Dive! Oh, my god. [both moan] [sizzles] Are you number 100,000? [high-pitched] No. [normal] Are you mad at me? [high-pitched] No. [normal] Oh, burger, you're cute. [high-pitched] You're cute, too. [normal] Heh. I'm not. Whoa. Linda! I think the news is here! I wonder if they heard about our 100,000th burger! What?! Hi. How are you? Uh, what can I do for you? Are you Bob? Uh, yeah. I am. I'm Randy Watkins, The documentary filmmaker. Ok. Uh... We're making a film about the beef industry. I heard you were about to hit Your 100,000th burger, And I wanted to shake your hand. Oh. Yeah. Um... Because you, sir, have blood on your hands. Eww. Is this ketchup? It's the blood of 100,000 slaughtered cows. You ketchuped me. We're here to force you to face your victims. Meet your meat. What the hell? Her name is Moolissa. She's due to be "Processed" in 5 days, Bob, Unless you choose to spare her life. Wh-why? That's right. You will decide her fate. It's a cow... ntdown. We'll see what your conscience tells you When you're looking your burger right in the eye. Ow! This is ridiculous. It's not a crime to make burgers. There's no blood on our hands! What's all the yelling about? Louise: Turns out dad's been putting m*rder*d cows in our hamburgers. And you made us a part of it! You make me sick. Kids, please. Oh, look. A cow. Hello, Blondie. Oops. I got some meat on you. Dead cow on live cow. Gross. Heh heh. Ohh. God. Uh, not a good time, Linda. Heh heh. Ooh. Randy, stop. Stop filming. You know, We're not gonna be in your cow documentary anymore. Well, you don't really have a choice, Bob, 'cause I stop at nothing to expose injustice to animals. Is that wig glued on? Yeah. It's-- it's the only way it would stay put. It's to, uh, humanize her. It's cute. Mmm. I've seen cuter. Honestly, she's a 4. Randy, I--I don't know where to begin. You know, this isn't even a female cow. Beef happens to come from steers, which are male cows. Then, uh, how do you explain that udder? Whoa. What an udder. Bob: Get away from there, Tina. That's, uh, not an udder. Oh, it's not? Don't listen to him, Randy. You go ahead and milk that cow. Milk it good. Oh, we did. You shouldn't have. Milk doesn't come out of that. Somethin' came out of it in that bucket over there. You mean this bucket of urine? I know urine, and that's urine. Gene, put that down. No! Well, it certainly smells like urine, But that's probably because she's sick. No, she's not sick. Sick of your practices, Bob! Ok. You know, we're gonna go inside and call animal control, And then you'll have to leave. [kids moan] Ok, so you've got all your permits, And you're renting this storefront? Yes. Oh, yeah. And, uh, this cow has had all its shots? Yes. Sure, sure, sure, sure. All right. Well, uh, great. My job is done. I'll see you guys later. Bye. Bye. Bye, animal man. What? Oh, will you sign A release to be in the movie? Uh, yeah. A movie. Yes. You're gonna be a star! Excuse me. Hello. Thank you. The person who called you. Thank you. You can't have a cow on the sidewalk. It's dangerous. Sir, sir, the only thing dangerous about this cow Is how adorable it is. Moo. Put your hand on this cow and touch it. What? I just know that that's gonna help you. Touch the cow. Kids: Touch the cow. Touch the cow. I'm walking away. Touch it. Oh, right. Run away, tough guy! Yeah! Go take a meat bath! Or whatever it is you people do! "Dial 'M' for mooder," interview one, take one. [clears throat] ♪ Ma ma ma ma ♪

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You think the cow is texting you an emoticon With its butt. Very interesting. Maybe this cow is trying to communicate with us The only way it knows how, with its feces. Like Gram-Gram used to do. Mom, let's say you had a brilliant plan, but to execute it, You needed to write something using cow poop? How would you do it? Oh. Is this a brainteaser? Hmm. I would use a frosting bag. Do we have one? Yeah, in the pantry. Am I right? Is it a frosting bag? We'll see, mom. Ahh. [chuckles] [evil laughter] Yeah. Okey-dokey. Bye, kids. Have a good day. m*rder*r! [groans] Oh. Hi, Randy. Whoa. Wink with open smile. Is this for me? It has to be. What should I do? Should I text back? Comin' through. [squish] Oh, no. Ehh. Enh. Aww.

Bob: It's me! It's me. I just make hamburgers. I never wanted to be a cow k*ller. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [gasps] 

  [snores] Whoa. Heavy sleeper. Wha--what happened? What's the matter? What's the matter? Go back to bed. [sighs] I'm sorry. Go back to bed. [thunder crashes] [Moolissa mooing] Hey! Randy!

Look who's too good for cereal now. He's trying to impress the cow. Don't be ridiculous. Someone knows how to treat A lady-slash- male steer. Bob, I am not comfortable with this situation. Lin, what was I supposed to do? I had that crazy dream. It was raining. Well, I had a crazy dream That there wouldn't be a cow's a-s-s In my face when I'm eating my breakfast. I know what that spells. Ass. Ass. Mom. Heh. Ass. Stop it. Say good-bye, everybody. It's going out On the street, where it belongs. Of course, ok? Of course. Right after breakfast. Cows can't go down stairs. What? What's that? Cows can't go down stairs. That's, like, a thing. I've heard that. It's like a fun fact. Bobby... Hmm. Cows can't go down stairs? That better not be true. [Bob grunting] Huh. What do you know? We know you'll push on a cow's butt For half an hour without asking for help. Gotta have that butt all to yourself. Randy: Hey, Bob! What's the deal, man? What'd you do to Moolissa? It's up here! Come get it out! Linda. Uh, it's not up here, Randy. My wife's crazy. Shh. If he knows I brought the cow in, He'll think he won. So what if he won? Get the cow out of the house now. Stop. You get it out of the house. I'm trying to-- come get-- Oh. Uh, this cow. This cow, yeah, is here. Aha! Dad, I ran that bubble bath For you and Moolissa like you wanted. Bubbles! I'm not taking a bath with Moolissa, Randy. 2 days left. 2 days to decide to send that cow to slaughter Or admit you're a hypocrite and a m*rder*r. Wow. What a movie. Bob, what a movie.

Where's the cow? I believe you mean, "Where's the steer? " Yeah. Don't forget about that pen1s. Yeah. Moolissa? Moolissa? Ha! Cows can go down stairs.

I think he hates leashes. Ooo! It's not my fault, Randy. She was stolen. I mean, it's no one's fault. Except for Linda's. I did what I had to do To protect my family and my carpet. Yeah, whatever. So who do we know That would steal a cow in a blonde wig? Maybe some perverts. Heh heh. We had a fight last night, me and Moolissa. I just wish I had a chance to make things right again. You wouldn't if you heard some of the things she was pooping about you. Hey, guys! Take a look at this! [fast-forwarding] ...On the cheap.

Louise, shush. [gasps] Randy, can you stop making your stupid movie for one minute And just be a human being? I don't know, Bob. Can you stop making your stupid burgers For one minute and be a human being? So now you're gonna guilt-trip me? That's what the whole movie is about. I thought we were friends now, Randy, 'cause we saved the cow together! Maybe activists- slash-documentarians Can't have friends, no matter how many cows they save! Well, that's just sad, Randy! I know! [moo] [tires skid] Oh, my god. That was close. I don't know what I would do if anything Happened to moo-- [groans] Ahh. I didn't hit her! I didn't hit her! I--I stopped! She's probably fine.

We're not wild stallions or humpback whales, But we wanna feel special, too. I do, anyway. You turn me into something amazing. Wait. Isn't this my subconscious Telling me what I want to hear? Hey, no. You know what? Yes, it is, actually. Well, it's working. Keep talking. Kiss me. No. I can't do that. You can, and you want to. [sighs] ok. One quick one because I owe you. Uh, maybe not.

Come on. Cheer up, you know? We're having fun. We are? Yeah. Plus, it's father-daughter time. Why don't gene and Louise have to have fun like this? Well, Tina, you're the oldest, ("Love is blue" plays) and you have added responsibilities here, like on Saturday mornings, for example, you're on the grill. I can't trust them on the grill. You know that. Fire comes out of it. Ha ha! I know. It's awful. All right. Bye. Ginger's cat died but in a really funny way. Ha ha ha! Oh... Louise: Tina, we just saw the most amazing thing ever. This might be the best day of my life, besides the day you kids were born. Words can't explain this. You just have to see it. Come with us. Come on, Tina! I can't. Dad won't let me leave work... I mean, fun. He won't let me leave fun father-daughter time. You fell for that? That's not a real thing. Come with us. Aw, Bob, let her go. All right, fine, but you're gonna miss when I scrape off the grill. That's the best part of the day, although today has been pretty slow, so there's not gonna be as much gunk to... oh. Everyone is gone. Oh. Ow. Oh! Aren't you supposed to lead someone who's blindfolded? It would ruin the surprise. Where are we going? At first, we thought it was a breakdancing class, and them we thought it was a special needs class. Now we think it might be a special needs breakdancing class. Also, it's brazilian... Slash hilarious. Sounds interest... Stupid? Oh, it's even more stupid than you could possibly imagine. Just wait till we get near it. They take off their shoes so when they open the door, the whole block smells like feet. Feet that have been cooked in feet. [Music playing] Yes! Still funny. Ha! Oh! Ooh. Ooh. Can you smell that? That's just what's coming through the walls. [Sniffs] That smells exotic, like ranch dressing. Tina: Whoa, he's beautiful. That's a man? Where are you going? I'm signing up for that class. What? Why? Oh! Don't open the door! The smell will k*ll us all! Let me go. Let go of me. No! No! Oh, the feet smell. The feet smell. Wait. What is it? It's Capoeira. Capo-what? Tina, are you really sure you want to do this? Yes, dad. Wait till you see it. Jairo is amazing. I have a DVD. Oh, by the way, I need $14.95 for the DVD. Wait. What? What's jairo? Hyah! Ola. My name is jairo. Welcome to the world of Capoeira. Capoeira is the most seductive form of self-defense. It combines peacefulness, fighting, and cardio in perfect harmony. Capoeira is breathtaking, but it is also breath-giving. You can advance through the stages by earning different colored cords at the troca de cordoes. Bob: Wow, I thought maybe you were doing it wrong, but that's actually what it looks like. They're bringing the tambourine back. That's a pandeiro, a brazilian frame drum. It's a tambourine. I'm gonna get mine. Those guys don't know how to shake it. I don't get it. I mean, what am I looking at here? What is it? Is it some kind of dancing. What is it? Jairo says it's not dancing. It's a deadly form of street fighting. Oh, yeah? Well, you don't need some male model to teach you how to fight. That's what dads are for. Come on. I'll show you some stuff. Box with your old man, huh? Uh! Uh! There you go. Just got to... there it is. Uh! Whoa, Tina. Good fight. Good fight. That was fun to watch. Jairo says if there's any Capoeira inside me, he'll find it with enough classes. Jairo knows a lot about life. Hmm. Jairo says he can hypnotize animals. Shh. But only if they want to be hypnotized... Tina, shh shh shh shh. Which they almost always do. Tina! Jairo says toothpaste insults your teeth. Tina, go to bed. Jairo only needs two hours of sleep a night because he regulates his heart. Tina, get out. Jairo sleeps with his eyes open. Tina! Jairo: Ok. Just follow my lead. Sa! Sha! Brazil! Sa! Sha! Brazil! Jairo: Class is over. We now have an hour of open practice time, which is completely optional unless you're serious about Capoeira. Mm. Mm! Mm! Mm! Ho! Yah! Oh, I'm definitely staying. Jairo: Ah! Ho! Hih! Sa! Tina is supposed to be here to cover the grill. It's after 4:30. She's at a kookaburra class. Dad, the grill is doing that thing again. Ach. What is your problem with fire? You know what? Go. Go away. Go down and collect trash and bring it to the dumpster. Does it have to be from around here, or can we go anywhere? Just go. Yay! Yeah! Trash! ♪ Trash! Trash! Trash! Trash! ♪ Yesterday I found a necklace. It's time for my afternoon meeting, you know, in the bathroom. Your 4:30 meeting? Yeah, my 4:30. So go. No. Tina made a commitment to be here at a certain time. I'm going down there to remind her that she has a job here. Wait. What about your meeting? Well, I'm postponing it today. Bob, you can't do that. I'm gonna set a time for 10:30 tonight. This is why I tell you, Bob, just have little meetings throughout the day instead of one big one, little poops. Oof! Oh! That is horrible. Wash your feet. I have an infection. Tina. Tine. Psst psst psst. Dad, what are you doing here? You're supposed to be back at work, Tina, to cover me for my 4:30 meeting. Dad... Oh, hello. Please remove your shoes. Oh, I don't want to take off my shoes. I'm just picking up my daughter Tina. Oh, you are Tina's father. Ola. My name is jairo, like "gyrate." Ola. Mine is Bob. Are you sure you don't want to stick around? I enjoy helping elderly men repair their aging bodies. Thanks, but I got a job I got to get back to, and so does Tina, plus I don't really dance. Although Capoeira incorporates elements of dance, it is a highly dangerous form of martial arts. Right. I'm sure it is. It seems like a great way to stay in shape, like jazzercise. Not like jazzercise. Whatever you say. Class, would you like to see a demonstration? Come on, Tina. Let's go right now. Sha! Hyah! Sha! Hyah! Ok, ok. I saw your movie. It's very cute. Hyah! Ponytail! Hey! You can't do that. You just hit me with your hair. Ponytail! Stop that! Hyah! Sa! Huh! Oh! Uh-oh. Dad, let's go. Come on. Give me a second here. What about your meeting? I just had my meeting. Right now? Mm-hmm. Uh... Don't. Don't. What do we do? Grab me that flag. No, dad. Tina, we're gonna get out of there, all right? Just let me think. Shh! All right. I got an idea. You go into the corner and yell. What? Go in the corner and start yelling like you're having a heart attack, and I'll run out. Ok. Go. Go. Fast. Wait. Come back.. I'm having a heart... what? Don't... shh! Don't do that. It's a dumb idea. Dad, I'm so embarrassed. Oh, oh, are you? I'm sorry because I'm not embarrassed at all because I just pooped my pants. I would do this every day if I could, Tina. Linda: No, no. He's in the shower now. Well, sometimes it's hard to feel clean after something like that happens. It's very embarrassing. Ok, kids. Your father is very tender right now, all right? Whatever you do, do not mention what happened today at Tina's class. Just act normal. So you pooped your pants. Linda, let's not talk about it. Wasn't a fair fight. He's younger, and he's cute and strong. Linda, this isn't helpful. Hey, when you got to go, you got to go. Linda, stop! Are you on the phone with ginger? No. I got to go. Ha ha ha! Sorry, Bobby. I'm not laughing at you. I was thinking about ginger's dead cat again. Louise: Dad, dad, dad. Yes, Louise? Dad, dad, hi. Yes? Hi. Did you know that it only takes two pounds of pressure to drive someone's nose bone into their brain? That's... what? Two pounds. That's it, dad. Why are you telling me this, Louise? Revenge. ♪ Revengeourine revengeourine revengeourine ♪ 

  Bob: Cut it out, gene. All right. Listen, everybody. What happened today is in the past, and we're never gonna talk about it again ever. I'm just glad Tina is quitting the class, right, Tina? But my body needs it. Your body needs to work in the restaurant with your father. Ohh...Oh, fine. If you need me, I'll be down here on the floor dying. All right. Sounds good, honey. Ohh... You have to learn to groan right, Tina. Ohh... Hey, she groans fine. It sounds weird. So you groan, then, if you're so good at it. Agh. That's a groan? Yeah. Agh. I'll do it. Let me do it. Agh. Aagh... Aggggh... Ach... Ahh... Meow meow... Aggggh... Brr brr! Gg gg gg! Ohh... Ohh... Tina, enough already. Come on. Louise: Tina, it's your boyfriend. Oh, God. Ola. What do you want? I got a message that Tina was very upset and needed to be encouraged to come back to the art of Capoeira. A message? From who? You're welcome, and...You're welcome. Well, I'm sorry. Tina is busy. She's working the grill. It's ok. I'll wait. Hmm. Ah... Uh...Well... What's wrong? Well, I'm looking for your fresh-squeezed juice selection. Is it on another menu? Ahem. Oh. Sorry. Here. Yeah. Here it is. This is the same menu. Yeah, because we don't have fresh-squeezed juice. [Imitating foreign accent] Fresh-squeezed juice is stupid. That is not how I talk at all. Yes, it is. So it Capoeira. It's stupid, ok? Tina: Dad, stop. Jairo: Oh, hello, Tina. I didn't notice you. That's ok. Is everything all right with you, Tina? My dad won't let me train anymore. Tina... What? It's because you made him poop in his pants. Oh, my God. Tina! Bob, please. There is nothing to be embarrassed about. It is quite common for a wounded animal to make a bowel movement as he is defeated by a much stronger predator. Hey, it wasn't you. It was 4:30. Here, Bob. Let me show you some very convenient sphincter-tightening exercises. No, thank you. Tight. Relax. I don't want... Tight. Relax. Stop it! Tight. Don't do sphincter-tightening exercises in my restaurant. Ok. Fine. Thank you. Gene: I'll be feeling this in the morning. Hoo! Bob: Gene! Well, now my stomach is full of negative energy, so I've lost my appetite, which is just as well. It's time for me to go to class. Tina, you should come with me. Remember, the troca de cordoes is next week. The troca de cordoes? What's the troca de cordoes? I feel if Tina trains hard, she has the potential to receive a promotion to yellow cord. Tina, listen to me. You're not going anywhere. I'm your father. Yes, Tina... But I am your Capoeira instructor. Wait. I'm going to class with you. Tina, what are you doing? Dad, you don't understand. I understand you're grounded, effective right no. Bob, let her go. No. She's grounded, Lin. We all just need a minute to calm down. Hey, Tina, you walk out that door, and you're no longer my grill cook. Dad. Calm down. I'll go get her. You get out of here! You hear me? Never look back! You are dead to us. Sorry, dad. There's no getting through to that one. Thanks, Louise. That was very helpful. Big day. Mm-hmm. Big, big day. Hmm... The troca de cordios. I know. I know it's the troca de cordios. I told you, I'm not going. Ok. Fine. I'm just gonna say one more time, I think that you should come support your daughter. Linda, I just grounded her. You let her go. Bob, I'm sorry. Ok. Come on. It's just a phase. I know you're afraid your gonna lose your little girl. That's sweet, but what'd you think, she's gonna spend the rest of her life standing next to you grilling burgers? Ha ha!

No! I can't break a 5, lady! I was just robbed! Did you not just see that? You were standing right here, idiot! Oh, you people commit. Get out! We feel terrible we didn't stop that robbery last night. Oh, that robbery was horrible. Ohh! Though I have to admit, it felt so good to hear the audience applaud. Are you guys talking about that show last night? I thought it was dazzling. Oh, yeah? You saw "dreamatorium"? Yeah. I caught the end of it. I thought the guy who played the robber really stole the show. Is that why you guys are here? No. They're here because the robber was a real robber and he stole 227 bucks. A little less than that. It'll be hard to catch this guy. Nobody got a good look at him. Put this down in your report. He was leading-man handsome. He was wearing a ski mask. Well, he had the presence of a young Burt Reynolds. And the pipes of an old Debbie Reynolds. Hey, the on-line reviews are in. Listen to this one. It's from hoosierdaddy1997. "The plot made zero sense, and the set looked like children made it..." Yeah. Children did make it... my children. "But the reason to go see "dreamatorium" "is the closing musical number. "The chemistry between the robber character and the lonely morgue operator was sparktastic." Did anyone mention the food? Uh...No. Great. So the robbery got rave reviews. Bob, we're a hit. No, Linda. We were hit. Good one. Yeah. That's good. Hey, thanks. I don't get it. We were hit. A hit is... am I wrong? ... Is a robbery, right? Right. A hit is a robbery. Well, technically, for the cops... technically, no. It's not... Forget it. Forget it. But in layman's terms... forget it, everybody. Nobody got hit. Everybody forget it. There we were, putting on the show of our lives, when in walked a man with a g*n in his hand, and he was looking for you know who. We will now take questions. Oh! Me. Oh! Oh! Large Tommy. Question for Tina. Were you scared? Um, uh... No. She wasn't. Oh! Oh! Normal-size Jenny. How big was the g*n, and did anyone get sh*t? That's a two-part question. I don't answer those. Aww. Tiny Peter. Does this mean you're in a gang now? That is correct. Our gang is called the broken glass kids. We'll cut you. Oh, wow. Ohh! Linda: Ach, I can wait for the show tonight. What, tonight? I thought maybe you'd consider canceling, but you're really committed to making me unhappy. The show won't be the same without the robber. What? You're all thinking it. I got to agree. That guy could really sing... And rob. Well, again, our apologies. We'll follow us as soon as we hear anything. So happy for you, though. Thanks. Ahh... Mort, you're right. What am I gonna do without the robber? You'll just have to... ♪ Take it easy ♪ Wait a minute. That voice. Oh, my God, it's you. You're the robber. Guilty. Last night was something, wasn't it? Oh, I know. We were electric together. So let's do it again tonight. Yes. I want to report a... what are you doing, Linda? I'm getting this guy arrested. No, but he wants to do the show again. He robbed us with a g*n. Hey, everyone relax. It wasn't even a real g*n... fake and currently in my other jacket locked in the trunk of my car. Bob, he wants to perform. This guy is the missing ingredient to my show. He's my garlic powder. Yes. The man who robbed my restaurant is here right now. He's about 5'8", maybe 150 pounds. I'm bad at guessing weight, though, so... yeah. I'll say. Yeah. 160? Oh, flatterer. All right. 170. Ooh! Aah! Call you back. You said the g*n was in your car. I lied. What about it being fake? Also a lie. See? A lie can be a twist. Since you did that, I'm gonna do this. Register. Oh, great. Again. Good luck tonight without me. We forgot to give this to you... a little "sorry we let the robber get away" bundt cake. You're doing it again. He just ran right past you. Hold that thought, Bob. The guy who robbed us just robbed us again. Hold on. Can you repeat that, dispatch? He's saying what I'm saying. The guy who robbed us, he just left. We got to go, Bob. The guy who robbed you was just spotted in the area. Don't catch him. Don't catch him. Don't catch him. Don't catch him. Ah, they got him. Bob: Jeez, that Julia packs a wallop. Ah, you couldn't just let me have my dream, could you? What? You mean, because I called the police? The guy committed armed robbery, lin, twice. But you committed m*rder, Bob. You blew my dream's head off. That's a little dramatic, lin. Yes, Bob, because I used to be an actor. Only two tickets left for "dreamatorium," the show over 3 people have been blogging about. Final performance, people. Do you think you're gonna say your line tonight? Probably not. You know, a good way to beat the stage fright... imagine the audience naked. I already do that. I imagine everyone naked. Everyone? All the time? Yeah. You don't do that? No. Oh. Well, try picturing the audience with clothes on, then. Like all their clothes? Well, maybe just a condom and a hat. Ok. Tonight's show is officially sold out, packed house. Are you feeling it, mom? Whoo! Are you feeling it, dad? Whoo! Eh, who cares? The audience is expecting to be dazzled, but thanks to your father, we have no star. Let's just go do the version everyone hated. Whodunit? Was the m*rder*r the corpse delivery guy, or was it the flower delivery guy, or was the m*rder*r the shifty Butler? [Applause] Wrong. The m*rder*r was me. Thank you. Good night. Hold on. I saw the show last night. Trust me, it's about to get good. That's our show, everyone. Thanks for coming out. What about the you-know-who surprise performer? Yeah. Well, the show is what it is, so... good night. I'll tell you what it is. It's garbage. Linda: Ok. All right, then. Drive safe. Bob: Nobody move! This is a robbery! I said, sit back down, lady, or I'll sh**t! Aw, Bobby, you're in the show. Garbage. I don't want your money. I just want the money of the big sh*t who owns this place. Ooh, way to commit, honey.

(Audience murmuring) Shh! Bob! Hey! Whoo! (Whistles) Bob! Hey, I think you missed a spot! Oh, never mind. That's just your mustache! (Laughing) Ka-boom! Ha-ha. Ha-ha, Jimmy! Good one. Uh, at least I could grow one. You can't! Gene? Louise? How about a "ka-boom"? You can do better than that, dad. Yeah, step it up. Okay, you do better. Give me something. How about, I don't know... Nice shoes, Jimmy. Do they make them for men, too? Ha! That's, uh... that's good. Hey, Ji... Oh. They're gone. God, I hate Jimmy Pesto with his crappy food and all his... customers. Oh, forget about your silly rivalry for one minute. Bob, listen, come here. Tina's birthday's coming up, and I think we should do something special since she's turning 13. This is the year she becomes a woman. Yeah, I don't want to hear this. Bob, she deserves a special party this year. If what it says in her diary is true, then I'd say she needs it. A lot. It's true. Wait. You read her diary? Yeah. What I can stomach. I just skim it to make sure she's not on drugs. What... what does it say? It says, "I'm not on drugs." It's pretty rough. But she thinks things will really turn around this year. Yeah, she dubbed it the "year of Tina." Why is everyone reading her diary? It's well-written. She's better on the page than in person. And what if the Nazis get us, and it's all we have of our family? Okay, fine. We'll make this birthday extra-special. All right. Tina, sweetie, come here. Yeah? Listen, baby, we'd like you to have and extra-special 13th birthday party. So take your time, and think about what would make the perfect party. I'd like it to be a boy-girl party. Mm-hmm. Mm. With mingling. I want to close the restaurant and invite my whole class over. No. And I want there to be a dj, and dancing, and a smoke machine, mmm-mm. And about two hours into the party, I want there to be a moment where I see Jimmy Jr. Across the room hmm. And we're pulled toward each other. Mmm-mm. We meet under the disco ball, mm. And we kiss until our bodies and souls become one. Oh, God. And it's my first kiss. Mm. And it's perfect, and I remember it forever. Freak. Scary. Wow. You've really put some thought into it. That, uh, sounds expensive. And I could do without the kissing Pesto's kid part. Oh. It's okay, I guess I wasn't meant to have a good life. Bob, a word? Now? Not now. Now. All right. You want to kiss Jimmy Pesto Jr.? Yes. A lot. Many times. I can help you. I'll be your kissing coordinator. It's my birthday present to you. Yeah, I think I know how to kiss. Ow! Do ya? You think you know how to kiss? You know how to lock lips, huh? Do ya? Ow! You think you know what it feels like to kiss a man, Tina?! If you don't know what you're doing out there, you could get yourself k*lled. Or worse! Ow, ow! STDS, Tina, have you heard of them? Have you heard of herpes? Have you? Yes. Yes. Do you know what herpes feels like on your mouth? Yes. What? What is it? What? Like, um, cuts on your mouth. That sounds right. Sla... I'm gonna slap gene. Ow! Closing down the restaurant, getting a smoke machine, and a dj? That's gonna add up. We have nothing extra this month, lin. Well, we got to do what we got to do. Look at her. Bob: She's so awkward. She's a good girl. Okay. I'll talk to Fischoeder about getting an extension on the rent. (Horn blowing) It's foggy. Yes, it is. Are you there? I am. (Exhales sharply) Why are we here in the fog? I-I wanted to meet you, and then you told me to meet you here. Oh, that's right. It was a good idea. I love the fog. Listen, Mr. Fischoeder, I know we talked about never doing this again, but if you can just give us two extra weeks this month on the rent... I'm going to have to stop you right there, Bob. Were-were you going to follow that up with anything? No. Oh. Oh, I love the way the fog feels under my cape. Uh, right. I'll get going. Bob, listen. What do you think of this? What if I don't give you an extension on your rent, but I do give you the opportunity to earn some extra money in one of my side businesses? That sounds... Sketchy. Oh, it is, Bob. Oh. But you get to wear this hat. Oh! So, for the next week, I'll be driving a taxicab to pay for Tina's party. And I'll be wearing this hat. Cool! Cool! Cool hat or job? Job. Hat. Thank you, dad. This party is gonna sizzle. (Imitates sizzling) Stop it. Wait, wait. Bob, Bobby. Yes? When are you going to have time to drive a cab? Well, I'll work the full day at the restaurant, lin, then I'll go drive the cab from 10:00 P.M. To 6:00 A.M. Aww, Bob. All right, all right. Wait. Why do you have to wear a hat? Just let this be fun for me. Dad, you won't regret this. When I kiss Jimmy Jr. Under the disco ball, it'll be like we're all kissing Jimmy Jr. Under the disco ball. I call first. Really? Well, if I'm gonna kiss him, I don't want to go after you guys. I'll go last. I'm fine with that. We're not kissing Jimmy Jr. Yes, we are! That's ten pieces of gum, Tina. Chew! Chew! A kiss is like a fight with mouths. And... time. Spit. I'm going to destroy this kiss. (Moaning, grunts) Ow! Not yet. There's my Johnny two-jobs. Making money for the dream birthday party. (Groans) Okay. Off into the night I go. Bobby, be safe out there. And make chitchat. You'll get more tips. Yeah, and keep the meter running. Watch out for pukers. And stay away from route one. It's bumper-to-bumper all the way to the interstate. Tina, how did you know that? I like traffic updates. Why? I like when they say "bumper-to-bumper." "Bumper-to-bumper"? (Sighs) Wow. Yeah. Uh, bye. (Grunts) Stupid beaded seat cover. Ooh, okay. I get it. Fm. Nice. Hey, guess what? You're my first fare. Oh, no! No. Oh. (Vomiting continues) (Gagging) Uh, where to, ladies? Fourth and ocean, doll. Thanks for stopping. Most cabbies are too prudish to pick us up. (Chuckles) And, uh, that's because you are...? Fabulous! (All laughing) That's true. Well... You're clearly fabulous. Yeah. Yes. Hey, eyes on the road, mister. Yeah, stop staring at us. This ain't no library. Don't fall in love, Mr. cabdriver. You can't afford us. Hey, who's picking up who here? (Chuckling) Hey. Don't worry, ladies. I'm-I'm kidding. I'm, uh, I'm a married man. So am I. (Bob laughing) Bob: Oh. Now, Tina, anyone can tie a cherry stem with their tongue. Let's see what you can do with this banana peel. Get-get it in there. (Groans) Bobby! Good morning. You're home. Yeah. Guess who learned a lot about transvestites last night. I was only on that web site for, like, two seconds. What? No. I was talking about me. I picked up a group of tr*nsv*stite hookers who showed me a side of this town I never knew existed. And, gene, you're banned from the computer for two days. After what I saw, I'm-I'm fine with that. (Muffled): What's a tr*nsv*stite hooker? Bob, I'm not sure this is appropriate breakfast conversation. (Yawning): I guess you're right. Maybe I should just try and go to sleep. Uh... (Snoring) Gene, honey, I think he's sleeping. I have to go to school. Shh, shh. Just hold still. Ew. Is this drool or sweat? It's both. Your father is a very moist sleeper. (Groans) Aw, look at my two boys. (Gags) Nice. Oh, a bow. Let's put that on dad's head. There's your tr*nsv*stite. Get the camera. I'm having a birthday party this Saturday. It's co-ed. Because I'm becoming a woman. Co-ed? My hands just got clammy. Hey, Jimmy Jr. Hi, Tina. This is an invitation to my birthday party. Hey, I notice you haven't RSVP'd to my party yet. Um, I need to ask my dad for permission. Can I let you know later? Sure, okay.

  Oh, how you holding up, Bob? Good. I mean, I'm tired. And, um, I might be a pimp. You're gonna need a bigger hat. Well, you're still father of the year. Hmm. Tina's party's gonna be amazing. I got a disco ball and streamers. It's gonna be like Buckingham Palace. Yeah, yeah. Studio 54. (Laughing) Those are two very different examples. Well, you get the idea. You know. It's a party. So, is Tina happy? Uh, she'll be happier once Jimmy Jr. RSVPs. She's over at Pesto's right now to see if he'll come. I told her to show some skin. (Tina sobbing) So, how'd it go? Jimmy Jr. isn't coming to my birthday party even though he wants to because his dad won't let him. All because our dads hate each other. Oh. Sorry, Tina. I'll never know how soft Jimmy Jr.'s lips are. My guess is, they're pretty soft. (Groans) Like, a... Like a Kitty cat's tummy. Gene, stop. Without Jimmy Jr., I don't want to have a party. Hey. Your father's been working very hard for this party, young lady. It's going to happen. Right, Bob? (Snoring) I'll refrost it. It's still good. Mmm. Oh, it's delicious. (Muttering) Tina, honey, your father's been working his you-know-what off, driving a cab to pay for this. Yeah, and we've rented the smoke machine, so this party is definitely happening. You've been working your you-know-what off? I've been working my ass off! Night and day training! Louise, take it easy. Do you know what she was like when I started working with her? She was a sick joke! Now look at her! Gene: Incoming. Bob, you gotta go talk some sense into Jimmy Pesto. This isn't fair. Fine. Jimmy: Uh, hey, Bob. You look like crap. (Laughing) Nice. Yeah, that was funny. Look, Jimmy, my daughter Tina said that Jimmy Jr. isn't allowed to go to her birthday party. Whatever issues we have shouldn't matter. Just please let Jimmy Jr. go. Okay. Okay. You know it's going to cost you, right? Oh, God. Yeah, you see, Bob, I'm a collector of rare and exotic trophies. Well, that's pathetic. And you have something I want to add to my collection. Your mustache. Your bushy, robust, filthy eyesore of a moustache. What are you talking about? I want you to shave your mustache, and bring it over in a baggie, and I'll pin it on the wall. What? Why? As a trophy. Trophies. Well, I'm not giving you my mustache. Well, I'm not giving you Jimmy Jr. then. This is crazy, just let him go to my daughter's party. If you want a bag of hair so bad, why don't you just pick it out of the food you serve here? Ka-boom! How dare you. No 'stache, no bash. So, what'd he say, honey? Are these lips gonna see any playing time? Yeah, is Jimmy Jr. Coming to my party? No, Tina. I'm sorry, he's not. (Groans) What happened? You two couldn't work it out? No! We couldn't work it out, Linda. He said the only way he'll let Jimmy Jr. go is if I shave my mustache and give it to him. So Jimmy Jr. can come to my party? What? No, Tina. But if all you have to do is shave your mustache then he can come. Yeah, it sounds to me like you just said that Jimmy Jr. can come. That's what I heard. Done deal. I'm not shaving my mustache. It's my mustache! Hey, no, watch it. You know, Bobby, you're just as handsome without the mustache. Kind of. Uh, so that's what we should show our kids, lin-- that it's okay to negotiate with terrorists? I'd drive a cab every night for the rest of my life for my kids, but I'm not letting Jimmy Pesto humiliate me. You're the most selfish father in the world. Oh, Bob. Good night! You can't shave it, Bob. It's glorious. Oh, I miss having a mustache. Pff. Miss it? Honey, news flash... I can see it from here. You can see it from space. Stop it, cha-cha. I will thumb your eyeballs out of your skull. Ay! Hey, come on. Glitter, your... I happen to like the way your upper lip looks. Thank you, prince Valiant. Your shift's almost over, right, papi? Yea... uh, yeah it is. Why don't you join us for a beer? Yeah. Yeah. We'll throw back a few beers and smoke some crack. Crack? Just the beer, then? What is that? Ooh, your breath! I know. Bobby, listen. Hmm? All right, I talked to Tina, I told her how hard you've been working, and she agreed to come to the party tonight. For a few minutes. It's something. What party? Bob, you're delirious. Shh. You are. You're drunk. I may or may not have tried crack. Okay. Last night. I don't think I did. But if I did, I liked it. Okay, Bobby, listen, go take a nap, and I'll watch the restaurant, please. Take off your clothes. Bobby! I got to go to bed. Bobby? I don't want to do this. Stop it. Get your hands off me, sick idiot. Such a freak. Pull it together. (Groaning) I'm like an animal! Keep your voice down. I'm like king Kong! Unbelievable. I need to go to bed. Good night. Go get me special pillow. Hurry, hurry, hurry. Hey, sleepy bear. What time is it? How much longer till the party? It started a half hour ago. What? Ow! Oh. You let me sleep all day? Why didn't you wake me up? I tried. That was not the first pickle I dropped on your face. Oh. The boys hate dancing, and the girls won't ask the boys. It's a Mexican stalemate out there. Come on, boys. You're the peanut butter. Girls, you're the jelly. Let's make some sandwiches! Oh, God, why is mort doing magic? It's his gift to Tina. Uh-oh. I mean, ta-da! Bob: Whoa. Tina, you look... great. (Sighs) Maybe I can cheer her up. Louise, smoke me. (Whooping) Tina, dance with mommy. Uh, uh, uh, uh. It's a party. All right! Did someone say party? They don't go to my school. I'm sorry, ladies. We're closed for a private party. We were invited by Bob. Bob? You invited tr*nsv*stite prostitutes to our daughter's birthday party? No. Maybe. I... This week has been kind of a blur. All of you are coming to my daughter's party. We're gonna have so much fun. And bring whoever you want. (Cheering) I might have thrown it out there. Is this the sweet 13 party? Dad, you brought all your nighttime friends, but you won't shave your mustache to get me Jimmy Jr.? (Sighs) Where do I put my coat? Oh, hey, marshmallow. So, marshmallow, how'd you get your name? 'Cause if you show me a sweet potato pie, I am on top of it. I knew it! Tina, I know you're upset because Jimmy Jr.'s not here, and that there are more transvestites than you imagined, but... Unless you're Jimmy Jr., and you're here to kiss my lips, I don't want to talk to you. Come on, girl. It's your party! You might as well enjoy it. It's like I always say. When life gives you lemons... Tuck em'! Uh, I think what my girlfriend here is trying to say is, when it's time for you to blossom into a woman, you can't let anything stop you. Not a party, not a boy, and not a town full of doctors who refuse to remove your pen1s. And you have a very good father, baby. Never forget that. It's true. Not many fathers would make the sacrifices your father made to throw you this party. Working two jobs. The things he saw. The things he smelled. He deserves an award. Bob, what'd you do? You lost your nose cozy. Oh, Bob. You made yourself ugly to save Tina's party. Yes, Linda, this is why I didn't want to do it. But you know, it's worth it if it means Tina will be a happy teenager. Just stop staring. Stop! Don't do this. I... just did it. You don't need to. I don't want you to. You know how mustaches work, right? Well, don't give it to Jimmy Pesto. What about Jimmy Jr.? Jimmy Jr. isn't gonna make this party perfect. You already have. Really? I'm sorry I didn't appreciate everything you've done for me. I didn't appreciate it as a girl, but I do appreciate it as a woman. It would have been nice to hear you say that a minute ago. b*st*rd. Come and join the party, Bob. That's Jimmy Pesto, cha-cha. The guy I was telling you about. Wait. That's Jimmy Pesto?! I know that guy. We all know that guy. But we know him as baby num num. Baby num num? Wait. Pesto is one of your dates? He wishes. We run in the same circles. He's a regular over at the desire dungeon. He's what's known as a diaper-lover. You know what that is? It's nasty. (Chuckling) Jimmy Pesto is a diaper-lover? Ha, ha, ha. Hello, Bob. Well, I see I'm getting my trophy after all. Bup, bup, bup, bup. Not so fast, baby num num. (Gasps) Baby... How do you know about that? (Laughs) Hey, baby. Pesto: Oh. Hi! No. (Laughs) We just wanted to see if "wittle" baby num num... Shh. Come on. Quiet. Wanted to change his mind about letting Jimmy Jr. Go to Tina's party.

(Coughing) May I store these in the bathroom? Sure. Everyone would love that. (Doorbell rings) More guests! Welcome! You must be ed and Nora Samuels! Yes. Hello. Hi. Come on, come in. I'll give you the tour. Okay, this is the salon. This is where we're gonna have the meet-and-greet, and you're just in time! Uh... Actually, we'd just like to go to our room, if that's okay? Right. We'd just like to get settled. (Laughs) What? Why? Stay here for the meet-and-greet. Maybe we'll come back out in a bit. No, stay. It's gonna be fun. Tina, get Javeed! I think he's napping. Wake him up! So, let's go around and we'll, um, we'll play a little game. Let's say what our most embarrassing moment was. Who wants to go? I'll go. One time I coughed at communion, and the wafer flew right out of my mouth and it landed on my boob! (Laughs) Who wants to go next? Javed? I'll take a pass. Get me on the next one. What about when dad got a perm? It wasn't a perm; It was a body wave. You looked like Barbra Streisand in the main event. You looked like Barbra Streisand's pubes. I did. How about how dad says gracias in Mexican restaurants? That's embarrassing. Remember the time you asked me to check your prostate and you made a poopie? Linda! Oh, remember when dad tried to go jogging? (Others laughing) (Laughter becomes hysterical) Oh, come on! What about when dad cried at the end of about Schmidt? Gene, why are you in your underwear? I was eating. What, you want me to get butter all over my clothes? Yeah. Now we just take him out back and hose him off. You're a doctor... is this a mole? I'm not a doctor. And that's a raisin. Oh... edible mole. (Laughs) All right, let's let someone else go. Samuels, how about you, what's your most embarrassing moment? I don't know. This? Yeah, definitely this. Hm. (Clears throat) Are we done? Yes, I guess we are done, Nora. (Whispers): Are you sure there aren't any rooms available anywhere else? (Whispers): No, everything's booked... I checked. Ooh, hello. (Chuckles) Hm. I'm cold. My nipples are so pointy! Ding-dong! It's for you. Mm-mm. Mm-mm. (Singsongy) Mm-hmm... Mm-mm. It might be a package... You should answer it. (Singing lively melody) Yecch! Lin, stop stewing and go to sleep. I can't help it, Bob! Our guests are such party poopers. All of 'em! No one has any b&b spirit at all! (Groans) Okay, just go to sleep, all right? You'll feel better in the morning. Fine! Gene, gene, your foot is down the back of my underwear. It's warm down there... My feet are cold. Yes, but it's my ass. Mm. Dad, are you still awake? Yes, Tina. I was just talking to Gene, right? A second ago? Do you think horses get songs stuck in their heads? Oh, my God. I don't know. Tina, go to sleep. Dad, do you want any chicken? Don't tell anyone... There's just enough for the two of us. Just go to sleep, all of you. I'm glad our guests are comfortable, Linda, 'cause this is great! Oh! Our guests! They'll appreciate me. I'll just have to try harder next time. (Grunting) Hey! (Whispers): I've got a backup. Bob: I've never been so happy to be at work. Yeah, you opened early today, huh, Bob? Well, there was a line to get into the bathroom up in the apartment, so I came down here to do my morning routine in the slop sink. (Humming a tune) (Humming a tune) Whoo! (Chuckles) Whoo! Bob, do we have any toothpicks down here? Yeah, over there. Pretty ones? What do you mean, pretty ones, Lin? The nice ones. How's the b&b going, Linda? Oh, it's great! Why? What'd you hear? What? Nothing. I bet it's magical up there. I picture it like england. It is, Teddy, it is. But do they appreciate it? Holed up in their rooms like dirty little gophers? Why come to a b&b if you're not gonna participate, you know? Oh, they're so ungrateful! I wish I was staying at your b&b. I'd sit in the parlor, and maybe I'd have a little wine, play some board games... Yes! Wine! Games! Teddy, you should stay here. What? You should. You're the dream guest. Really? You're the one I'm looking for? Do you have any vacancies? Yes! Louise's room! Whoa, whoa, whoa, Linda, Louise's room? She'd m*rder us. She's a big girl... She'll get over it. Linda, she won't get over it... When you vacuumed in there, she wouldn't talk to you for a week. Plus, it's not even a room; It's, like, a closet. That sounds perfect for me... I don't need a lot of room. I'll just bring, like, one outfit. Oh, I love it! I'll get my stuff. This is gonna be great! Well, have f telling Louise you're kicking her out of her room, Lin. Wear a helmet. (Humming a tune) ♪ Ah, ha, ha... ♪ What are you doing? Oh, hi, Louise. I was just... Oh, hi, mom. Hello. You're holding my stuff. Hello, my little lady. Hello, mom. What are you doing with my stuff? I was just welcoming our newest bed-and-breakfast guest into your room. Into my room? Say hello to Teddy! (Gasps) Hi, Louise. You got wonderful stuff in here. I love, love, love it! What? Except for this little guy; he's kind of giving me the creeps. (Quietly): This isn't happening! Mother, this isn't happening, right? Has the world gone crazy?! (Chuckles) Okay, come on, Louise. Let's leave our guest alone. You mean your guest, 'cause I did not invite Teddy to come into my room and move my stuff around! That's right. Come on. See you in a little... bit at the wine-and- cheese mixer, Teddy. Sounds good, Linda. And I'll see you in hell, Teddy. I'm sorry, Teddy. I will see you in hell! Where are the Samuels? The cheese is getting sweaty. They're in their room. I think they're jumping on the bed. I heard the box spring going crazy. Sounds like they're "busy." They should be busy eating cheese and sipping wine. What do you mean, they're busy? Like, they got homework? No. They're... it's... Busy jumping, they can't take a jumping break? Ah, Javay! You came back for the wine and cheese! You got to catch up. Chug! Chug! Chug! Whoa, look at all those males. Yes, Tina! One of these lucky bugs will mate with the queen, and then she will bite off his head. So romantic. Cheese? No, thank you. Eat it. Mm-mm. Aw, have some. Mm-mm, mm-mm. Open your mouth. Open the mouth. Mm, mm. Just try it. (Whimpers) You're gonna love it. You're gonna love it. It's really good. Gene, you're over your limit! (Retches) (Chuckles) Well, I... Hate to miss wine and cheese, but it's time for these little fellas to meet their mates. (Nervous chuckle) Bye-bye. Wait. I want to watch. Well, I'll tell you, Linda, I'm having the time of my life. You're not gonna hear me whining about it. Hey, "whine." (Laughing loudly) (Laughing) Everyone should be here for this! They don't know what they're missing! (All laughing) (Laughing): I heard the... joke from the... hallway. Do you like that, Louise? Yeah. Oh, it was...Was really funny! (Laughter dying away) Get out of my room. I'm your guest in your room... Did you talk to your mommy? It's not my mommy's room; it's my room. No, I know, and I paid $75, and I'm just going to stay in your room for a couple of nights. Louise, put some cheese in your mouth. Mmm. Mmm, isn't that delicious? Yeah, it really goes down easy, doesn't it, Teddy? Ow. (Chuckles) Just so you know, Teddy, you have one hour, then I get real. If I were a pheromone, where would I be? Aha! (Crazed laughing) (Coughing) (Hacking) (Groaning) Good night, Javee! Oh! Uh.. Good night. Crazy lady. She's a nut. Am I right? Oh, you're bad! Good night, Teddy! Good night, Linda! Sleep tight! Sleep tighter, Lin. Don't let the bed bugs bite! I won't. Hey, my pillow smells funny. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Good night, Samuels! Oh, woo! I'm sorry! I'm sorry. Hey! Oh, my God! Oh, God! Could you please close the door? Yeah. Oh, my God. Okay. Sorry. Sorry. No. With you on the other side of it. Okay. All right. All right. Leave! (Gasps) Why is Mr. Samuels wearing handcuffs? They are... They are escape artists. (Gasps) They are?! Yes. Isn't that interesting? Okay, time for bed. Let's go. All right, Louise, since you're new here, I'll show you the ropes. That corner of the bed is for eating. This right here is the exercise area. This is where I thrash. (Groaning) Yeah. I'll stand, thank you very much. (Snoring) (Groaning) 

  (People snoring) Here we go. Have you talked to your mommy? Why don't you talk to your mommy, Teddy? About your new roommates. Where is everybody? Careful, Bob. I reused the cheese from yesterday. Some of the omelettes have toothpicks in them. Ow. Ow. Ah. Oh, good morning, Javee! I hope you and your bugs are hungry. My appetite is gone, along with several of my specimen jars. They contained my most virile males. Oh, no. Ah, little insects with wings. How far could they go? Hey, guys. (All yelling) What? Do I have bed head? Oh, good God, Teddy. My beetles! Aah! What? Teddy, you've got beetles all over your face. Is that right? I haven't looked in the mirror yet. These males are in an extremely amorous state. You mean, right now they're trying to mate with Teddy's face? Javed: Yes. Aw. Oh, God, Ted. Does it hurt? Nope. Nope. Don't worry about it. Teddy, you should probably get to the hospital. You okay to drive? No, I don't need a hospital. I'll be fine. This is still a magical weekend. Aw. You know? He's the perfect guest. What's for breakfast? Eggs! Ugh! Nothing gets to this guy. You! I don't know how, but you did this. (Sniffing) I know how she did it. She used my pheromones on him. Okay, well, uh, Linda, everyone, have fun in the b and b. I'll be downstairs in the restaurant. Bye. Bye, dad. Bye, dad. No! You deal with her! She's out of control! Okay. Uh, give her her room back. No! Well, that's all I got. Bye. Louise! You're grounded. Go to your room. Gladly. That's all I ever wanted. No, I mean my room. Go to my room. You can't make me. Oh, yes, I can, miss Missy. I guess you can. I've never seen these beetles so aroused. I have that affect on beetles. (Laughs) I haven't had this much action in a while. Are they gonna call me tomorrow? Probably not, right? That's okay. Teddy. Making jokes, covered with bugs. You are a man! Damn you! Does anything get to you? Teddy: There's really only one thing. Gene & Tina: Yeah? Teddy: Costumed characters. You know, like the ones in amusement parks. Really? Why? It's the eyes, gene. Their cold, dead eyes. ...Watching you while they make love to your wife. While they what?! I mean... When they... uh... Go to birthday parties. Gene: All right. Thank you, Teddy. Oh, thank you, mom's purse. Well, thank you, phone. Yes, I will make a call. (Whistling) Oh, I gotcha. Oh, you're sizzling. I love your sound. Oh, hello. You have costumed characters, right? Oh, that's great. Ah, I'll take the hippo, the fox. Here's a cookie. Here's a cookie. A baby bear. And here's a cookie. And this will be credit card. (Knocking) Brought you some cookies! What's going on here? Ah, we have to go home. What are you talking about? You can't leave. You're on vacation. Sit down, enjoy the cookies, unpack your pointy bra and your whip and whip him. He's a naughty boy. I'm a naughty boy. Get to it! Did you just lock the door? She just locked the door. I... I don't know what's going on. You can come out when it's time for the ice cream social! You, too! Hey, there's my perfect guest. Hey, Linda. I got good news. I'm upgrading you to platinum status! Oh! Platinum status. That sounds fancy. It is! You hungry? You want some room service? No. Eh, I guess I can eat. I... what do you want? Uh... bacon burger? What? Bacon burger. Bacon... First-first word. Bacon. One syllable. No. Two syllables. Two syllables. Oink, oink, oink, oink, oink, oink, oink, oink! A...... pig. Dinosaur. Bacon! Bacon burger. Kevin bacon. Second word. Burger. Break pads? (Mooing) Dinosaur. Jurassic park! (Mooing) Charades! You can't guess charades. Yes, you can. Oh. Is it charades? (Mooing) Cow. Burger! Burger. Bacon burger! All right. (Cheering) Yes. Bacon burger! All right. I can do that. (Doorbell rings) Uh, doorbell. I'll get it. Oh, footloose. Can I... can I help you? Is there a Teddy here? Teddy, you've got visitors. Oh, thank you. We're the fuzzy buddies! Are you Teddy? (Gasping) What's going on here?! (Yelling) No! Someone's excited to see the fuzzy buddies. (Yelling) (Grunting) Don't... What? Whoa. You're a big bo... oh! (Teddy grunting) Oh, my God! Teddy. (Teddy crying) (Crying) It's almost the ice cream social. Linda, what is going on up here? You're losing control of your b and b. What are you talking about? Everything is going perfectly. Right. Right, Lin, everything's fine. Bob, do you have my bacon burger? Oh, yeah, the bacon burger. Here. Oh. Bob, can you help me? I can't chew. You need me to feed you? Yeah. Chew it up for him, like a mama bird. Linda, no! He's platinum status! You're crazy, Linda! It's all right, guys. I got it. Perfect guest. So let me get this straight. Teddy beat up a bunch of giant animals. You locked Louise in our room, and then you locked the guests in their rooms? They were gonna leave before the big ice cream social at 3:00. Lin, just give me the key, all right? I'm gonna let them out. No. Yes. No. Look at yourself. Look at what you've turned into! Oh, all right. All I wanted was a charming bed and breakfast, that's all. Now what am I gonna say to God when I go to heaven? Uh. (Gasps) Uh-oh. I lost the key! Oh, my God, what have I done? All right, all right, listen. You know Louise picks locks. Louise hates me. No, she doesn't hate you, Lin. I'm sure she's broken out of our room already. Oh. I'm gonna go deal with Teddy. Why don't you try her room? Okay. Hi, honey. It's mommy. Oh, hello, mother. Please do come in. Louise, I'm sorry I rented your room to Teddy and then locked you in our bedroom. I accept your apology, mom. Who among us hasn't gone a little overboard from time to time? Aw, thanks, sweetie. And you're gonna apologize to Teddy. Okay. And there's something else I need from you. (Sighs) I would just cut it up right now. Oh. No, not that. Will you please help me get Javed and the Samuels out of their rooms? I locked them in and I... I kind of lost the key. There might be something I can do. Linda: Javed, I'm sorry I locked you in your room. You're free to go if you wish. You locked me in my room? No. She's completely bonkers, isn't she? Look at me when I'm talking to you! They're gone. How did they get out of a locked room? It was their greatest escape. Look what they left behind. Look. My tongue is trapped. Now it's escaped. Now it's trapped. Now it's escaped. Hey, look! They're still climbing down. You two all right? You need any help with your bags? No. Uh, actually we're stuck. Please help us. I suppose we could get a ladder. How much did you like my b and b? A lot. Are you gonna recommend us to your friends? Yes! Are you gonna leave me your e-mail address? Ed & Nora: Yes! Get 'em the ladder. Uh, thanks for coming. Sorry. Sorry again. Ah, here's something for your trouble. Two dollars. Thanks a lot. I don't know what to tip in this situation. Yeah. Not two dollars. Oh, hey, Teddy. Ah, you all right? I think I worked through my issues, Bob. Me and the owl !Re gonna go get a drink. I'm pretty sure there's a woman inside. That's a guy, Teddy. Oh, that's a woman. The owl was a guy. It's a woman. The fox was a girl. Oh. Did the fox leave already? Yes. Oh. Linda, you are a delightful hostess. Aw, thanks, Teddy! See you at lunch, Bob. Well, that was all right. It was pretty good. I give us a b. (Groans) B plus. (Groans) A b and b plus! (Chuckles) My face is sweaty. Gene, take that off. Never! Oh! (Groaning) Oh! Ow! Ow! Aah!
(burger sizzling) (Glass breaking) Wow, I thought last year's art crawl was terrible, but they really outdid themselves this year, huh? Yeah. Ugh, bad. Very bad. Mm-hmm. Oh, look at that. Really bad. (Groans) Really, really bad. Ugh! Louise: Ugh! I think they're... good. Dad, why does art crawl suck so much? Well, it's just a very loose definition of art, Louise. And don't say suck. Don't say suck, please. You're right, though. It does suck. I don't want you kids to think this is what art is. We should go to a museum. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa. Yeah, maybe not. Yeah, we should... We should not go to a museum. Let's not overdo it. Let's just walk around and make fun of this stuff. Yeah. Okay. Why don't we just go back to the restaurant? Because your aunt Gayle is there hanging up her art, which we're not allowed to make fun of at all. Well, why can't we make fun of aunt Gayle's paintings? She's family. Yeah. That means never holding back anything, right, pit stains? Am I showing? Let's just say your shirt looks like my underwear right now. Yeah. Well, look, no one tells Gayle anything she can't handle. That's your mom's rule, all right? You treat her like a mental patient. Well, I mean, she probably should be one, right? Yeah, I heard she ate her lipstick once because she wanted to feel red inside. And she made a dress out of live shrimp and wore it to mass. Oh, and she shaved her cat. Bob: Come on, Louise. You know none of that is true. Except for the cat shaving. And maybe the shrimp and the lipstick. Are you kidding me? My kid could paint that. Tina: Wow. It costs $200. Someone bought that mess?! How rude! Harold! (Snoring) Harold?! What? There are some poorly supervised children amongst the art. Get rid of them! All right. Let's go. Keep moving. Excuse me. Are you a...? Are you a bouncer? Are you gonna bounce my kids? No, no. Just keep it moving, chubs. Chubs? You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here. (Coughs) Hey, easy, pal, all right? Don't touch. Come on, dad. This guy's not worth it. Ah, listen to your kids, fatsy. Fatsy? Come on. Come on, dad. Louise... Dad, look me... Give me your eyes, dad. Give me your eyes. Mm-hmm. Take a deep breath. You are lucky, pal. It's not worth it, dad. If you hit him, your hand would smell like ointment and pee. You smell like ointment and pee. You smell like ointment and pee. You smell like ointment and pee. You smell like ointment and pee. You... Well, that was awkward. What is that place? Louise: You don't know reflections? They sell art, not just during art crawl, but year-round. Reflections. It sounds like a strip club, the way you say it. Reflections. Mmm. So, brace yourselves for aunt Gayle's art show. Mom said aunt Gayle told her they're just adorable animals. Oh, yeah? Well, that doesn't sound so bad. (Nervous laugh) Hi, hon! How was art crawl? Hey. Huh? Everything's going great here. We're having fun. Oh, wow. Lin... Gayle's here! We hung-hung her paintings! Look at this one! Look at that one! Linda, can you just let me see...? Oh, my God! Gene: Yeah! Anuses! Oh, God. Oh, my God, lin. It's a few days, Bobby. Linda, there are animal anuses all over our walls. Just think of 'em as cute little rumps. Lin, they're anuses. I'm trying to think of worse paintings to hang in a restaurant. Um... nope, I can't think of any. Bad monkey! Kids, stop that. No. I'm spanking the monkey! No way, dad. This is the best thing that has ever happened to us. Horse butt. Oh, hello, sir. Don't look at the pictures of the anus... Yup, he already did. Okay. You see that, lin? No one wants to eat with one of those staring at them. Come on, you can't seriously think that this is a good idea. Well, they're not for me, but we promised Gayle she could display her art for the art crawl. We can't take it back now. She's fragile. We have to support her. She's not that fragile, lin. (Fork clinks) Oh! (Panting) What happened? What happened? (Panting) Gayle, Gayle honey, look, look, it's a fork. What? Look, it's a fork. Oh, it's a fork. Ha. Oh, you're k*ll*ing me. (Laughs) She's k*ll*ing me. Okay, so she's fragile. And that means we have to be the anus restaurant? Yes, it means that. Oh, we can make t-shirts! It'll say: "Milk, milk, lemonade. Around the corner art is made." Bob! Do you love 'em? Or do you just love 'em? Um, how did you...? Why... why would you paint... this? The inspiration came to me on a mountaintop. What should I paint? Huh? ♪ Every night in my dreams I see you ♪
♪ I feel you... ♪ Huh. He loves 'em! All right, listen up. All the suckers come out for art crawl. And they all want to pay money for crap. So paint some crap, and we can sell it. Wait. You're not painting? No, I'm management. You two paint the stuff, I'll do the rest. I'll be wheeling and dealing. I'll be getting my percent. Okay, let's see what you got so far. Time's up. Paint brushes down. What the hell is this? I told you to paint commercial touristy crap. I'm sorry I'm not a sellout. I can only paint what I feel. And I can only paint the truth! The robots are coming! (Imitates laser g*ns firing) Hide! Ah, this is great. You guys want to be real artists, huh? Okay, that's an angle. I can sell that. But if you're going artsy, then you're going all the way. Someone's cutting off an ear. I need both of mine. I wear glasses. Welp, what's your excuse? Don't got one. Have at it. Teddy, what's wrong? You haven't touched your food. I don't, Bob. It's just the, uh... The anuses? Yeah. Yeah, you know. Yeah, they're, uh... I know. Oh, they're like Mona Lisa's eyes. They follow you wherever you go. Ooh, you're right. Well, I like 'em! You like 'em? Ugh. Yeah. What's the problem? The anus is the window of the butt. It's true. I guess she's just painting what we're all thinking. Well, okay, but, mort, would you hang them up in your funeral home? 'Course not. That would be terrible for business. I'm not an idiot. Count to three, but do it on "two." I'll keep it on ice until art crawl's over. Thanks, t. Here goes. Now listen, gene. I'm gonna have trouble cutting through the cartilage at first. Mm-hmm. (Groaning) While I'm doing it, just think about your art. Okay! All right. Ready? Ninja robot. Ninja robot. Ninja robot. One... two... (Grunts) Hey, kids. Oh, hey, dad. I had to get away from those anuses for a while. You mean mort and Teddy? No. No. Your... Gayle's paintings. What are you kids doing? What knife?! What do you mean, what knife? Why are you holding a knife? Why am I holding a knife? She's turning me into a real artist. No, she's not. Put the knife down, Louise. I want to be an artist! Like Leonardo Dicaprio. That's right. That's Da Vinci, gene. No! The only way I can sell this garbage is if I make them legit! Hey, wait a second. I have an idea. You know who loves the stuff you kids draw? You? No. Your mother. This crap is like catnip to her. She can't resist it. Bring 'em inside. All right, we need to get these up before they get back. Your mom will be so excited to see this stuff, she won't even notice that I took Gayle's paintings down. Pretty manipulative, dad. I see where I get it. Thank you. You should see my taxes. Uh, what's this supposed to be? A ninja robot fighting a vampire tape recorder at stonehenge. Who's that in the background? That's my friend Ken. Why is he like that? He's an albino. Oh. Yeah. I've never met Ken. Is he real or imaginary? He's real, and he does improvised hip-hop. Okay, how old is he? He's 28. You can't have a 28-year-old, albino friend. Yes, I can! All right, I can't deal with this right now. Tina, what do you got? It's our dentist. Dr. Yap? Why is he nude? Wait, has he been nude with you, Tina?! I exercised some artistic license. Uh, I... We're switching dentists. No! I can't deal with that right now. But... Let's get 'em up. (Door bells tinkle) (Sighs) Linda, Gayle. How was lunch? Very interesting. I think... ♪ the waiter might have been hitting on me. ♪ Yes. He was very attentive. And he asked you a lot of questions about food. What was that all about? Uh, Bob? Where are my paintings? What? Wha...? Oh, I had to take a few down to make room for the kids' stuff. Bobby! Aw. The kids' stuff! Yeah. It's like our wall is a giant refrigerator. I love it. Huh. Gee, Bob, if I didn't know any better, I'd think... You didn't like my paintings. What, no? I... Aw. No, no, no. I know when I'm being lied to, Bob. It's like when I look at myself in the mirror and say, "it's going to be okay." Fine, look, Gayle, I'm gonna level with you. No. No, Bob. No. No leveling. No. Here we go. Gayle, the thing about your paintings... Bobby! Ah... Oh, look, senior visitors! Yay! (Laughing): Oh. Well, look who it is. Great. The art store people. Oh! Reflections. I love that store! I love your yarn. What can we get for you? I'm not here as a patron. I'm here as Edith Cranwinkle, chairperson of the art crawl. I rushed right over here because there are murmurs, whispers and murmurs around town, that you're displaying... (Whispers) Certain offensive orifices during the art crawl. Offices? Orifices! Ahh-ha! Not anymore. I took them all down. Oh, what a relief. I'm glad you agree with my decision. Your decision? What decision? That you can't display that type of art here. Wait. I can't? Absolutely not! It's obscene. Obscene. Oh, really? Yes. I won't allow it. (Laughs) Excuse me? You won't allow it? That's right, Tubsy. You heard her. Who are you two to tell me what I can or can't hang on my wall? I am chairperson of the art crawl. Well, I'm the chairperson of this restaurant. And you know what? They're gonna go back up. How dare you! Aw, Bobby! Gene, Louise, go get the paintings. Here they are! (Both gasping) Step into the butt closet! I will not! You should try it. I will not! What's it going to take to get you into this rhino anus today? You are in direct violation of my wife, Bob. Oh, I am, am I? Well, how about this? Horse anus. Oh! Oh! Look at it. No! Oh. Chicken anus. No! Take a closer look. Fox anus. Harold! Gayle, I'm commissioning a new series of anus paintings. Two words... bigger and more. Oh! Out! Aah! I cast you out. (Edith yelling) Harold: Oh, my gosh. Keep 'em coming, Gayle! Gayle: Almost done! Oh, my, I feel like I could fall into this one! Bob, I thought you didn't want to become the anus restaurant. Well, I've embraced it. We are the anus restaurant, lin. A-nus! A-nus! Kids. Bob & kids: A-nus! A-nus! A-nus! That's right! Go tell your friends! Or don't. Either way. It's your choice. Hey, you asked for this, lin. I'm just doing what you wanted me to do, support your sister. Oh, what a crock of crap! This is about you and your pride and that Edith. And you just want to provoke her. Damn right, I do. This one big enough for you, Edith?! (Crazed laughing) 

  (Laughter grows louder) (Yells) Fresh from their triumphant debut at Bob's burgers! That's right, gallery-quality paintings at sidewalk prices. Art lover, check this out! Hey, that's Dr. yap. He's my dentist. That's a good likeness in the face, but, uh... The proportions are off. No, I... the proportions are right. Well, I'm getting adult braces. So? So I should know! Dr. yap has short, strong legs, and his torso is... Well, I'm off to do some more roller-skating! You know what? I've done all I can for you hacks. You refuse to paint touristy art, dad won't let me cut off gene's ear... we're through! We are through! I'm dropping you as my clients, and I'm dropping you as my siblings! Go take some art classes, you wannabes! Hey, Andy, Ollie. Hm? Huh? You, too, red. Huh? Come here. You ever heard of the game, "you guys paint whatever I say and then I sell it"? Does the winner get a hug from Ollie? Ah, Andy, you can have one of those any old time. Now? Ooh! Ooh, ooh, ooh! Mmm... All right, stop hugging! Let's paint! Let's paint shells and sunsets and crap! Yay! Yay! Yay! Attention everyone! This installation is not approved by the art crawl association. It's obscene, and should be taken down immediately! Well, I'll tell you this... it doesn't need to be approved by the art crawl association, because this is now a permanent installation. (Gasps) Permanent? You'll regret this, Bob! Oh, is that a threat? Oh, when I threaten you, you'll know it! Yeah, when she threatens you, you'll know it! Okay, was that a threat? You bet it was! Is that supposed to scare me? Defi... (Hacking) (Continues coughing) Yes. (Hacking) You want some water? He would never drink your water! I really need s... (Hacking) He's fine! (Phlegmy grunt) You're fine. (Hoarsely): I could use some water. You're fine. Bob, water. No! He'd rather die than drink your water! I wouldn't! Yes, he would! I'll drink it! No, water, Harold! Please! Never! (Screams) ♪ ♪ Edith! Bob: Unbelievable. This is nuts. I can't believe Edith would do this. (Gayle gasps) My artwork! It's ruined! They painted underpants on my beautiful anuses! Gayle, Gayle, no need to go off the deep end, okay? You should be flattered, right? All the great artists get censored. They do not. Yes, yes! All of 'em do. Every... all the good ones. Oh, God, what a whirlwind we've been on. I feel like let's just put this all behind us and move on. I'm going down there. What? Where? To see Edith. Bobby, don't do anything crazy. I'm not crazy, they're crazy! And they're not gonna get away with it! Glue that shell in the middle, Andy! What are you doing?! My hand is cramping up! I ate too much glue! Andy, Ollie, come here. Listen, I'm pushing you because you've got talent, babies. And I'm gonna take care of you, oh, you better believe it. But first you've got to make some money for mommy. Okay, babies? You, too, red. What's your name, sweetheart? Devin McJim... Shut up! It doesn't matter! Stop talking! Start working! Work! Shells go in the middle! Louise: Here you go. One-of-a-kind original. Help support these poor, deformed orphans. 20 bucks. (Strained grunting) Whoa. Dad's pissed. That's a take five. For me! Not you! (Strained grunting) Oh, look, everyone, the town pornographer. Can it, Edith. I'm here to get an apology. For what, standing up for artistic integrity and common decency? There's nothing decent about what you did. First you tried to tell me what to put on my walls, then you vandalized it. Have you no shame? I have no idea what you're talking about. And neither does he. What? Hit her, dad! I'm not gonna hit her, Louise. Hit her, dad! Gene? Tina? What are you two doing here? Learning to paint. We're honing our craft. Okay, well, good luck trying to Polish a turd. Wait, I thought you hated my kids. My artwork shop is open to all who respect art. So I'll have to ask you to leave. Then ask me. Please leave. Not before I get an apology. Not on your life! Have it your way, art lady! Hey. Poke her in the eye with the brush. Oh, I've got a better idea, Louise. Ha-ha-ha! Take that! (Gasps) Dad, what is that? It's an anus. Others: Oh... What else would it be? What has this been all about? You call that an anus? It looks just like a black dot! What kind of anus is that? Oh! Well, then, Harold, it looks like I'll need to practice a little more. I'll say. How about one right here! Edith: Oh! And what about here! Ow! This one might need an anus! Edith: Aah! How about this lighthouse! Bob: It has an anus now! (Gasping) Looking good, dad. Thanks, teen. Rip that lighthouse a new one, dad! I feel so alive! This is what God must feel like. Kids, tell your mother not to wait up! Use the brown! Use the brown! Louise: You should've seen it, mom. Dad went nuts! Aw, Bobby, what'd you do? I got justice, lin. Dad painted an anus on a lighthouse. (Laughs) Yeah. And on a Mountain and on a sunset and on a sailboat... And on Dr. yap. And Ken. Yeah, I'm sorry I painted on your paintings, kids. They were in the line of fire. You painted anuses on paintings? Where's Gayle? I got to tell her how I stood up for her. She's in the basement trying to get the underwear off her paintings. You shouldn't have done it, Bob. Are you kidding, lin? It's the best thing I've ever done in my life. Ow. See, that's how you put on handcuffs. They don't look tight enough to me. Why are these on me? Because you anally defaced her property. But she started it... look what she did. Edith: Oh. I like the new direction and wish I could take credit. But like I said, I had nothing to do with it. Yeah, we'll see about that. I'm pressing charges. We're gonna take this to court! Wait, now you're charging her? This is confusing. Is dad going to jail? I'll wait for you. Word of advice, dad: Don't tell your cell mate what you're in for. I hope our new dad is a blond. I can't take it anymore! Edith didn't paint the underwear! I did it! (Others gasping) What? You painted all those underpants, Linda? Oh, I couldn't help it. Those anuses were haunting me in my sleep. (Bouncy classical music playing) ♪ ♪
♪ ♪ Linda: Anus! Anus! Anus! No...! You were the one who said we had to support your sister. I did support her, until I figured out a way to destroy her art while preserving her feelings and blaming someone else. I thought those looked familiar. Gene: Oh, yeah! Mom! You painted your own underwear! What? How do you know what my underwear looks like? How don't I know? She wears it around the house, flaunting it, like she's all that. I do not! Okay, Bobby, let's go to jail. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Can't I... Edith, can't I just pay for the paintings? Well, the retail value of what you destroyed was over a thousand dollars! We'll give you $200. We haven't sold a burger all week, lin. We don't have that kind of money. I got this one, dad. Are we good here? Fine! We'll take it. Me and you can settle up later. Where the hell'd you get all that money from? Shh. Don't ask, don't ask. It's art crawl. But... Shh! Shh, shh, shh, shh, shut your mouth. It's art crawl. What... but I... Shh! Shut your mouth. But the m... Shut your mouth. I... I said shut your mouth. It's art crawl. Come on, Harold, let's get out of this ass parlor. It stinks! O-okay. You know, Linda, none of this would have happened if you'd just been honest with your sister. It's true, mom. I've been honest with these two since the day gene got fat. I remember the ice cream sandwich that did it. I regret nothing! And Tina... bad breath every day. Not if you like fish. See how tough they are? We've been desensitized. I'm so numb. All right, from now on, I'm going to be honest with my sister. She deserves to know the truth. Gayle: I did it! I did it! I fixed all the paintings! I added pants and huge, pendulous breasts. Oh, I'm so excited! I think it's my best work ever. What do you think? I'm not hearing anything. Oh, my God. Gayle, it's beautiful. They're great. They look great. Great. Great! They're great! Fantastic! Yes, they are... Yeah, look at that! Very, very... I knew it! I knew they were great! Here, you hang these, and I'm gonna go back down and finish the rest of 'em. Oh, I couldn't do it. I wouldn't have done it. There's exceptions to the honesty policy. Yeah, yeah, I mean, lin, you did the right thing. Oh, thank you for supporting me. I want to hug each and every one of you! Come here, all of you! Come on! All right. (Pained grunting) Oh, I love my family! I love you! Let me out of your love jail! Ow! (Linda grunting) (Crickets chirping) Do you think she's coming back? I don't know. I'm so cold. Cut me open and crawl inside me. One of us should live. Okay. Louise: Mama's comin' back, and mama better see some paintings! (Scream)
Okay. Burn unit, commence. You go first. Oh, I play soccer, 'cause I forgot I have hands. Burn! I'm on the news, because I have a huge head. Burn! Louise: I can't outrun a lawnmower 'cause my dress is so tight. Oh! I'm dead. Burn. (Stirring Western music plays) Whoa. It's Banjo. Oh, I'm a cowboy, and I got... Wait, wait, wait. Suspend burn unit. This is a great movie. It's a Spaguetti Western, the best one, underappreciated. He plays a Banjo. Yeah, I can see that. And they made a whole bunch of these. Dad. Do we have anything bigger than this? Oh, Gene, what'd you do? Nothing, yet. Just planning ahead. (Gunfire on television) What are you guys watching? Nothing. Go back to bed. The burn unit is just me and dad. (Gunfire) Whoa! Did he just sh**t bullets out of his Banjo? Yes. Damn! Oh, you like that, Gene? 'Cause we're changing the channel. No, no. Let's watch it. This is pretty much the beginning. What? What?! Gene, sit here. (Grunts) It's like pushing a couch off the couch! Yah! Here. Hold my plunger. Louise: Yah! Gene: Ow! Linda: Oh! We are just so thrilled that you chose us to cater the event. (Quietly): Mom, mom... fill me up. I just hope we can live up to last year's event. Mom. That Colleen Caviello, mom... She really outdid herself. And never lets anyone forget about it. Just fill up the little mug. Ouch. Right. Right, right. Okay, Mr. Frond. Good-bye. Good-bye. So what are we catering? That sounded promising. Oh, it's a real big deal, Bobby. It's a fund-raiser for Tina's conflict resolution club. Colleen Caviello made the food last year. This year she can go... Blow a balloon. Yay! You're catering our fund-raiser. That's great. How much does it pay? Nothing. Nothing? It's a benefit, Bobby. It's a spaghetti dinner. But we don't make spaghetti. This is school fund-raising, Bob... it's a pasta game. You make spaghetti, or you go home. Besides, it's for a good cause. Oh, yeah... to one-up Colleen Caviello. That's a, that's a great cause. You weren't there, Bob! You don't know how awful it was. (Slow, distorted): This is delicious. (Slow, distorted): Oh my God, I love this ziti. (Slow, distorted laughter) (Distorted laughter continues) (Slow, distorted): They love my ziti. And that was the worst day of my life. Anyway, this isn't about Colleen, this is about Tina. We're raising money to buy a bulletproof trash can so gang members can finally throw out their g*ns. Aw. And we're teaching conflict resolution skills you can use in your own lives. That's right, Tina. And Mr. Frond is running the whole thing. Ugh, Mr. Frond? He's a tall drink of... Annoying. That may be true, but you're gonna drink that drink, mister. I don't want to. I have worked too hard to get us this event, so you'll be nice to Frond, and you'll make spaghetti and meatballs! No... no... Yes... yes! Fine, but I'm gonna half-ass it. Yay. Dad, check it out. Little princess guitar. Gene, that's mine! You never use it. I'm like Banjo. What's the bad guy's name? Ceviche. Ceviche, yeah. He reminds me of this kid at school... Choo-Choo. Choo-Choo? Yeah. He's kind of my Nemesis. If I'm telling a joke, he'll say the punch line before I do. A vampire walks into a bar and says I'll have a... I'll have a blood lite. Huh? What do you call a Spanish guy with a rubber toe? Roberto! Rober... (Groans) What kind of bees make milk? Boo-bees! Boo-bees! (Angry grunting) So, I'm gonna use this guitar to stand up to Choo-Choo like Banjo. That's, uh... That's great, Gene. But I think your face is wrong. My face is wrong?! Yeah, you should do the Banjo icy stare. Like this? (Chuckles) No. Not like that. (Growling) No, no, no. Don't growl. That... Like this? Hmm. Maybe try that. Is Choo-Choo scared of stroke victims? Terrified. Hey, Gene, Gene. How do you plead? I'm innocent. Your fingerprints were all over the m*rder weapon. I don't have fingers. Your honor! I don't have time for this. What?! You don't have time for food court? Where are you going? Hey. Wanna hear a good one? (Groans) What's green and sings? Go ahead. Do it. El... Ah. (Plays note) Elvis P... Elvis Par... Ah! (Plays note) Forget it. I'll tell you what's green and sings... Elvis Parsley. (Laughing) You don't say the punch lines to other people's jokes anymore. You got that, Poo-Poo? (Plays note, kid guffaws) What the hell? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, everyone. Thank you. Anyway... Gene, look. They're about to announce the verdict. Guilty. No! Take him away. Gene, where are you going? What's up with Gene? I don't know, Lasagna. (Sighs) I don't know. You know, cooking spaghetti isn't even cooking. It's just, like, boiling water. Hey, Bobby, can I come to this thing? Uh, I don't think so. Why not? Some of these moms are divorced, right? They meet me, I meet their kids. Maybe throw the ball around. Not inside, but... uh, we agreed no more school events for you, Teddy. Hey, dad. Guess what? What? I acted like Banjo and took Choo-Choo down. (Plays chord) Everyone laughed. Well, one kid laughed. Peter Pescadero. He has a learning disability. Yeah, but he knows what's funny. (Plays note) Now that you stood up for yourself... Oh, congratulations, Gene... Can we stop talking about it? Okay, tonight, I propose, dad, that after everyone else goes to bed... Gene... We fire up the burn unit and we watch Canine Criminals, and then that stretching show, and then maybe a little Beetlejuice in Español Beetlejugo. Beetlejugo. Beetlejugo. Ay, ay, ay, ay! I would, except a certain best dad in the world went out and got this! It's the complete Banjo box set! All 12 DVDs and over 28 hours of extras. Yeah! 28 hours?! Dad, can I... see that fork for a minute? Um... here. Thank you. And I just want to... (Grunting) Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! (Screaming): No! Best part right here, Gene. There's only gonna be two shots, me sh**ting you, and then me drinking this sh*t of whiskey. (sh*t fires on TV) Wow. Oh, what a line. Go ahead, watch your stupid movie. There are other people for me to hang out with around here. Tina, get up. Let's hang out. Okay. Maybe we can practice conflict resolution. Say something mean to me so I can not react. Anything I want? Yeah. Ha-ha! Well, uh, your room looks like it was decorated by a perverted jockey. When you say that, what I feel is that you're trying to hurt my feelings. Oh, my God. Why do you talk so (slowly): Slow? When you say that, what I feel is that you're trying to hurt... Oh man, Tina. This is really, really boring. Okay, well... Hey, mom, you want to hang out? Oh, I'd love that! Oh, mother-daughter bonding time. Just like me and my mother. Ooh! Makeover! Hmm... Okay, my little cowpokes. Time for school. You can watch the rest tonight. Mom! How could you? How could I what? How could you encourage this? Oh, Louise, don't be a pill. A little father-son bonding is going on here and that's a good thing. These two don't always do it so well. Tambourine solo! Sheesh. All right, this is how you throw a spiral. You ready? Here comes a bullet. Hmm. Oh, stupid ball! It's 'cause there's no laces. I'm hungry. All right, we're done. Go inside. I want peanut butter! It turns out we bond better over movies that I like to watch, that I make Gene watch. Yeah. Oh, that's... That's adorable. I'm going to school. Good. Great. Why don't you learn something and become a lawyer. Abs: The conflict resolution program sweeping our school. You all know my system, and at the spaghetti dinner, so will your parents or legal guardians, um, Becky, 'cause your mom's in jail. Tina, Jocelyn, Jimmy junior... let's rehearse. Becky, you just watch. Tina here just found out that her best friend Jocelyn told Jimmy junior that Tina, is "whack." And... acting. Tina, Jocelyn told me you are whack. Jocelyn, you skank. I hate you. Whatever. It's true. You are whack. (Both grunting stiffly) And... freeze! Well, that resolved nothing. Let's rewind, shall we? (Imitating rewinding tape) Let's work out our abs. A! Access your feelings! When you gossiped about me to Jimmy junior, it hurt my feelings. B: Be apologetic! Sorry. S: Slap it! Well done. Do it just like that at the dinner. Oh, enjoy your lunch, everyone. If you ever gossip about me to Jimmy junior outside of a conflict resolution skit, I'll punch you in the face. It was just a skit, Tina. I will punch you. Again and again, and again and again... My God, what a psycho. And again and again... And again and again and... Well, the important thing is, I shared this movie with Gene and it helped him stand up for himself at school. Eh, I beat up a lot of kids like Gene when I was his age. Not that I was a bully... just kids like Gene, you know? That get beat up. Bob, how are the meatballs comin'? Because they need to be perfect. Hey, it's just like your burgers, only spherical! Hey! Hey, what? They're not for you. They're for me to show off in front of the other moms at the fund-raiser. Bobby, make one extra-big for Colleen Caviello to choke on. Okay. All right, looks like I'm sitting with you today. Here's the pecking order: Me, then either of you. Which sticker do you like better, my purple ladybug or Susie's red one? And good-bye. Hey there, Spew-Spew. Funny seeing you here. In the cafeteria during lunch? Yeah. (Plays note) Why do you keep doing that? Keep doing what? (Plays note) You're weird! Weird? I think you mean anti-hero. Look at the hat. It's mom's sun hat, you dork. You like finishing my jokes. Well, finish my food. Gene, you are being a class act jerk. This is all about jokes from your stupid joke book. You've insulted Jokes for Blokes for the last time. (Grunts) Oh, don't you even think about it, Gene. Food fight! (Kids grunting) 

  (Slow, distorted): No...! And these two, Bob, were throwing at each other. I hate you. I hate you. They seem to be in conflict. I'm sure we can, uh, work through it. I'd like you to take a look at my abs. Um, no thank you. Show him your abs, Mr. Frond. We'd all like to see your abs. Okay. I really don't. And your ding-dong. Gene. Gene, why don't you access how it makes you feel that Louise is angry with you. Fine. (Plays note) That's all I'm gonna say. Well, this is all I'm gonna say. Hi-yah! (Grunting) Let go of my... H-hey. L-Louise, Louise, Louise. You're not using your abs. Um, this is dumb. (Chuckles): Bo... Bob. Yes. When you say "this is dumb," it makes me feel like pinching you in the eye. (Laughs): Why did you do that? So we can resolve this and set a good example for your children. Okay. I will now kick you in the shin. (Chuckles) Okay. Okay. All right. (Plays note) Hey! Don't throw repressed memory Emily! She won't remember this. Well, this is really working out, Mr. Frond. Your system is amazing. Ho. No, no, no, no, no. We're gonna go. You know what I forgot to say? Detention! Detention! And you, I am gonna cut you! I am gonna cut you out of the conflict resolution spaghetti dinner! Wha... oh, come on, you can't... Too late! The conflict resolution spaghetti dinner will now be a conflict resolution fast. Well, that didn't go so well. Mm-mm. Yeah, he seemed angry. Frothy. And kind of bloated, right? Mm. Maybe he's dehydrated. (Groans) Your mother's gonna k*ll me. Frond: So glad we had a chance to talk this out! (Grunting, punch thuds) Emily, I'm sorry! Detention?! And we're banned from catering the peace club dinner! Bobby! I'm sorry, Lin, I... I can't even tell you how many favors I had to call in to cater that thing. How many? Two! Tina, you're supposed to be watching the restaurant. I'm too upset to serve food. W-what'd you do? Did you lock up? Yes. Were there customers inside? I don't know. No one's gonna come to the fund-raiser now. Good job, Bobby! It's not my fault, Lin. It was Mr. Frond's fault. And Louise's. And Gene's! And most of all, that stupid movie. Hey! Hey, don't blame the movie. All right. Leave bingo out of this! Shut up! (All arguing) All of you! I'm locking these movies in my jewelry drawer. Aw, come on. Unfair! 'Bout time. You're overreacting, Lin. The hell I am! I'm in charge of a spaghetti dinner that's not gonna have any spaghetti! If we all just worked on our abs... Not now with that crap, Tina! I can't believe I got detention. I can't believe I got detention. If I were you, I would teach Gene a lesson he'll never forget. I had a perfect record. And then you tainted it. Taint. Looks like you got Choo-Choo right where you want him. Just give him that icy stare with some little princess and finish him. You want a little of this? (Shuddering fearfully) Oh. Oh, yeah, he wants it. Now give him the icy stare. (Growls) Put him in his place. You're dead! Quiet! (Over headphones): ♪ s*xual, s*xual ♪ (Grunting along to funk music) Okay, well, I'm gonna go get Gene and Louise from detention. Great! Bring some meatballs. Got plenty of meatballs. All dressed up and nowhere to go. Mmm. Meatball. Mmm. All right. (Chewing noisily) I'm gonna leave. Gene, this happens now! Uh, how are we doing this? Staring contest? (Howls) Joke-off? Kick his ass, Choo-Choo! Why are their shirts off? Oh, boy. I didn't want to do this. I haven't even pressed the blue button yet. I don't even know what sound... (Howling, screaming) Fight! Fight! Fight...! Stop. There's not gonna be a fight. Oh, thank God. Let me go! This train is off the tracks. Choo-Choo! Oh, I get the name now. I always thought it was 'cause of how he chewed. 'Cause he chews like a train. Hey, calm down. Let's go home, Gene. You touching my kid? Sorry. What? I said, you touching my kid? Oh, he was attacking my kid. Oh, yeah? Good. What is going on with the shirts? I'm gonna beat your ass so bad I can skip the gym tonight. Dad, this is bad. Boys: Fight! Fight! Thank you, Louise. Fight! Fight...! I have it under control. This happens now! Choo-Choo: k*ll him! (Yelling) Run! I can't. I've got this friggin' guitar around my neck! Louise: Ha! (Both yelling) Bob: Oh, Gene, push down. I'm trying. All right. (Grunts) Louise: Ow. All right, just so we're clear, we're not hiding from those guys. We're respectfully declining their invitation for a fight, okay? Right. No, thank you. I would absolutely get into a fight under the right circumstances, if... (Sniffs) What's that smell? Oh, Gene! Gene! I'm sorry! Hey, shh, shh. I hear them. (Gasps) They're coming. Real...? You-you hear them? Gotcha. Louise, enough. You've been stirring the pot for three days, and acting like a baby. Now you owe your brother an apology for getting him in trouble. Me?! Both of you owe me an apology. Both of us? Why? Because we wanted to watch Banjo? Because you stopped hanging out with me. What? Shh. Use your slide voices. First, the burn unit stopped hanging out. Then, the lunch bunch stopped hanging out. God, we have lame names. Who the hell am I gonna hang around, if not you two? Mom and Tina... the menstruation nation? Ugh! That's a really bad name. You're all I've got. Louise, I'm sorry. Me, too. Don't cry. Ha! Got you. You thought I was really crying. Gross. (Farts) Gene, stop. Oh, my God. I can't help it. It's anxiety. And turkey jerky. (Sniffs) It's so incredible. Your farts smell like mine. Really? Oh, great. Are you guys bonding again? I'm sorry, but that's a huge discovery. A fart is like a fingerprint, and we have the same fingerprints. High-five. Ugh! Put your hand up. All right. I swear my farts smell like your farts, dad. I don't think so, Louise. Oh, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. (Farts quietly) Huh? (Sniffs) No. That smells like your mom's. No! Oh, your mom. What are we gonna do about mom and Tina? They could live in here with us! I think I know a better way. I'm starving. How embarrassing. Guess people will be talking about my baked ziti for another year. (Mocking): Guess people will be talking about my baked ziti for another year. Oh, Linda, I didn't see you. Hi, Coll. How are you? (Amplified over P.A.): Uh... Thank you. Tonight, with your help, we raised over $100. It was $110. I warned you, skank! (Grunting) Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Girls, please. It's not time for the skit. This isn't a skit. It's... This is real life. Last year, the only fighting was to get seconds on my ziti! Okay, that's it, Colleen. Let me tell you about that ziti. That sauce was store-bought, and you know it. (Gasping) Ladies, please! I thought I told you, Bob. You and your spaghetti aren't welcome here. But I want to say something. No, thank you. I've had enough of your hurt speech. Would it make a difference if I... Worked on my abs? Oh. I want to... a... What was a again? Anus. Amyl nitrate. Access... I want to access my feelings. Frond: Mm. Okay, okay, okay, okay, enough, enough, enough, enough. Everyone's about to k*ll each other here. Let's... let's eat! Linda: All right! Meatballs! Meatballs! Get your meatballs here. And spaghetti. Here, Colleen, why don't you put these balls in your face? Louise: Food fight! Bob & Linda: No, no, no...!
All right, listen, you kids are gonna be on your best behavior, right now. The landlord, Mr. Fischoeder's, coming over to talk about the lease, and we don't know if he's gonna renew. He'll renew. Well, we haven't always paid our rent on time. We never pay our rent on time. Thanks, lin. Uh. All right, listen. Your mother and I are gonna go make him some food. That's gonna save us; Our food, and our service. You kids start cleaning now. Pick that up. And, Gene, you go outside and try and drum up some business. I'll play my triangle! Ding-da-da-ding, da-da-ding, da-da-ding, da-da-ding... No! You don't understand my music! Shush. And here's the other important thing: When Fischoeder gets here, you will not... I repeat, not... stare at him like he's some kind of spectacle. I don't-I don't ever stare at him. I-I don't stare at him. I don't know what you're talking about. Um... Yes, Mr. Fischoeder is an eccentric. Yes, he wears a white suit. And an eye patch. And he drives a golf cart everywhere. Louise: He is one white cat away from being a super-villain. All right, but he owns this building, everybody. He owns the amusement park, and just about everything else in town, so you're not going to stare at him when he gets here. (Children whistle and hum) Here we go! Bob, Linda, your children are refusing to acknowledge me. Ah, kids, stop doing that. Acknowledge Mr. Fischoeder, right now. Are you a superhero? Can I feel your hair? Stop! Stop! Go clean something, now. All of you. So, uh, Mr. Fischoeder, you know, after all these years, I've realized, you've never eaten my food. Mm-hmm. And I want to present to you one of my favorite specialty burgers. Oh, no offense, Bob, but I have a policy that I don't dine at any of my tenants' establishments. Oh. But I saw you eating at juicy Sushi. That's different. That place is incredible! Have you had their starfish? It melts in your mouth. No? Nobody? You? No. Anywho... Quiet in here. Like this a lot, Bob? Yeah, well, I mean, it's 12:30. Sorta the lunch lull. The lunch lull. That's what we call it. Huh. Wow. Jimmy Pesto's lunch lull is really busy. Bob: Well, Jimmy Pesto's is a pizza place If you're into that kind of thing... pizza. (Laughing): Stupid. I like pizza. Pizza?! Where's pizza?! Shush. Anyway, when people want a burger... A good American burger... They have nowhere else to go, but... Sorry. Sorry to interrupt. Let me be honest with you. I enjoy you, Bob. Your mustache, -it's fascinating. Thank you. Do you mind if I...? You're touching it. Yeah. I... That's... Yeah, you're... That's really something. Thank you. Thank you. Mmm... Hmm... hmm... Listen, Jimmy Pesto has tendered an offer on this space. Jimmy Pesto?! He wants to move over here? Yes, he wants to move his gift shop over here. Gift shop?! This would be an amazing gift shop! (Gasp) I could do all my Christmas shopping here! Yes! No, no, no, no, no, no. Please, I-I think if you tried my burger, you'd see that... Bob, you're always late with the rent. And Jimmy pays early. Wait, wait, wait, Mr. Fischoeder, please. Be-before you make a decision, just taste my burger. Just taste it. (Sighs) Fine. Another trip to the gym. Jimmy Pesto may be a good businessman, (choking) But I think you'll find that, unlike his microwaved junk, my food is... Mr. Fischoeder? Mr. Fischoeder? He-he's choking. He's chok... How do I do it?! What do I do? You just push! Push! Push on his belly! Hit him in the crotch! No, Gene! Don't hit him in the crotch. Yes! Hit him in the crotch! I'll hold his hair. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Linda, please. Oh, my God! Wow! He's turning blue! Gene: Put his hand in warm water! He can't die! He cannot die in here! Let's move him outside. No, everybody, hands around him! Group heimlich! One... Family: ...Two, three! (Family screams) Bob: There it is! Holy crap! (Sighs) Give him some room, kids. Give him room! Oh... ow... So, um... Ow... Did you, uh, did you like it? (Sighs) Your rent is due Friday night. And if you're late, I'm giving your lease to Jimmy Pesto. Do you want me to pack this to go? You're gonna need fries with that. (Bob sighs) Linda: So Mr. Fischoeder is okay... But we've got to pay the rent in full by tomorrow night. Paying the rent in full! What's next? Paying your other bills? Don't worry. We'll figure something out. Right, Bobby? Jimmy... Freaking... Pesto. Linda: Oh, Bob. You know, Pesto's not his real name; It's Poplopovich. Of course it is. The guy's a complete phony. What is this obsession with him? I'm not obsessed with him. Yeah, you are. You're both obsessed. It's like you guys are stalking each other. (No voice) I could care less about the guy. I think you should both grow up, at least for the kids' sake. Let me see. Let me see. Ugh. The kids. Why does Tina have to like Jimmy Pesto Jr.? Of all the 13-year-old boys in the world... Eh, she likes them, too. It's kind of romantic, though... two families at war, a budding romance... It's like West Side story! Ugh! (Humming dramatic melody) Rumble! (Hums dramatically) Stop. You know Louise is friends with the twins, now, too... Pesto's little boys... Andy and Ollie. No, no, no. I'm calling a ban on all the Pesto kids. Our kids are going to cease contact. Let's be best friends forever. Okay. Let's cut our hands and press them together and become blood brothers! Okay! (Grunts) No, spit brothers! Spit in your hand and then shake. Let's do both! Sorry, I'm saving my spit and blood for my honeymoon. Let's rub our eyes together. You can get my pink eye! Okay! Twins (in unison): Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ooh... So hard to be friends these days. Hey, is that your brother Jimmy, touching himself all over? Ollie: Yeah, he's really into slow dancing now. Louise: He knows it's supposed to be with other people, right? It is? Ugh, look at Tina. Kissed the guy, and she still can't get his attention. She should try pigs in a blanket. That always gets my attention. (Dreamy sigh) Bob: Ugh. What's he up to now? What!? Oh, my God! "Now serving burgers. " Burgers...! That's it. It's time for a showdown. All right. ♪ We're going to a rumble ♪ I'm gonna confront him. ♪ gonna confront him ♪ Confront him right in the face. ♪ yeah, right in his handsome face. ♪ What? What? You said "handsome face." You did. It's a... "Right in his handsome face. " I know what I said. You think he's handsome? God, yes. No, I'm saying it with anger, like, "you handsome face!" So he's... He's so handsome you wanna-you wanna punch him. He looks like tom Selleck. When I die, I want you to cremate me and throw my ashes in tom Selleck's face. (Laughing): That's a crazy request. I get it. All right, let's go. Kids, watch the restaurant. Oh, lord. So many people... Kids, watch the restaurant. Tina, watch the restaurant. Restaurant, we both know you can handle this. Call me if you need me. Love you. Jimmy said he'll be right out. You wanna try a Pesto-colada? No. Yeah, sure. Lin. What? Free drink. Yuck. Look at that. "Pasta la vista, baby"? "Frank and Zelda, oldies with goodies"? Ugh. Louise: Some confrontation. I want some action. I need some action. (Gasps) There's Jimmy Jr. (Sighs) Busing tables has never looked so sensual. Yet so menial. Tina: Yeah. Here's Jimmy. Now some fur's gonna fly. Bob of Bob's burgers. Jimmy so-called Pesto of Jimmy Pesto's. Let's skip the niceties, shall we? Pesto-colada for the lady... On the house. Thank you. Except for that nicety. (Clicks his tongue) What are you doing, Jimmy? What? Selling burgers, coming after my lease... What are you doing, Jimmy (Loudly): Poplopovich? Whoa... Yeah, your name is not what it says on the... Linda: Mmm. Mmm. Lin. Mmm, ah. (Laughs) Stop. Ah. It's good. (Groans) Bob, I run a business, all right? I don't know what you're doing, with your fancy ingredients. (Falsetto voice): "I'm Bob, and I like kale." Trev (Laughing): Kale! There's nothing wrong with kale. Why don't you call it snob's burgers? Snob's burgers, ha! You think anything that isn't frozen or rotten is fancy, Jimmy. Okay, Mr. fancy face, let's see who's got customers? ♪ Ah, da-di-di-di... ♪ Ah, I got some. Let's see who doesn't. Oh, you. Bob: Ha. I've got... I've got customers, Jimmy. They're not there right now. They have a life. Oh, yeah? Well, good luck making rent by tomorrow night. Well, good luck trying to steal my customers with your best-o burger. They'll never... Oh, my God! Bob! Unbelievable. We just came to watch the ball game. I had the urge to sing some journey! Come on, Linda, we're leaving! Go, go. Go, go, go, go. (Loud slurping) Hmm! You're not going to get our lease, Jimmy! He's going to get our lease. No, Bobby! Forget about Jimmy Pesto. All we need is one really good day of business, and then we can pay our rent and keep the place, huh? Huh...? I guess you're right. If we could pack the house tomorrow... Sure! A packed house. We can do that. Let's have a family brainstorm, right now. Gene, come on! Uh, live entertainment featuring a mix of techno... Yeah, yeah? And dad's favorite... The triangle! ♪ Ding-ding-ding ding-ding ding ding-ding-ding. ♪ Oh, yeah. ♪ 

  No. Tina, go! Slow dancing! Grind, grind... No. Grind... Tina, stop. What are you do... stop that. Louise, what do you got? When I was young and naive, I would have said "arson," but I'm gonna go with "voodoo." Hmm. I like arson. No. Seriously, dad... voodoo. I have a book. No, I have a book! No. I'll go get it. I got it. Make some flyers... For half-off, and good for tomorrow night only. You know, that might bring some people in. Yeah, yeah. Okay, I found it. Forget voodoo. We're doing flyers. What? Who's candy-ass idea was that? I'm out of the room for five seconds! Ah, we're on a roll. Let's brainstorm something else. Uh... Christmas card... No, no, no, we're done brainstorming... we got it. Oh. How 'bout we shave our heads for the Christmas card? Spell our names wrong. Shave our legs. Totally soft, silky family. I like it. I have a book! Nobody forget what they just said. I'm... I'm gonna go get some paper. Mmm. Eh, it's pretty good. (Chuckles) It's pretty good. It's not good! It's not good! Jimmy: Goin' in the garbage! If I can get a lock of Jimmy Pesto's hair, I'm pretty sure I can control his mind. Really? I don't know. I'm just skimming. All I know is it works on fools and imbeciles. Oh, me, me. Can you help me dance Jimmy Jr. Back into remembering we're going out? Yes, I can. I just need a lock of your hair. Okay. Can you help me get a gig in the music business? Hair. So long, old friend. Hair: Wait, can't we talk about this?! So if you stick the penny into the potato, you've just made a battery out of a potato. I've just made a voodoo doll out of a potato. Both: Oh! Who is it? My sister Tina. She wants me to make your brother slow-dance with her and remember that they're going out. Can you get a lock of your brother's hair? Yup. Agh! And you said I was crazy for carrying this around. Now who's laughing? (Laughs) Me! Both: Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Hi, kids. How was school? All: Good. Mom, Andy and Ollie are helping me with a school project. I'm gonna need 15 potatoes, a lock of hair from you and dad. Also rum and cigars, if you have any. Wait. What's this for? English. You two have homework? A little. Not doing it. Good 'cause you're going down to the pier to hand out flyers. (Grunting) Tina: We're back. Did you pass 'em all out? Yup. We saved the family. Jimmy Pesto even took one. So did Jimmy one wing. He's a seagull I met. What the hell? "Tonight only, our competitor's flyers "good for half-off your burger, plus a free t-shirt"? Oh, my God. Linda: Aw, Mort's bringing his mother to dinner. No. No. No! Those are my customers! This is a war now. This is a war. Listen, it's the theme from braveheart! Ding-ding-ding-ding, ding, ding... No! Wait, wait. This is the best part: Di... Dad, what are you doing? Mmm-mm. Mmm-mm. Shh! Gene, Tina, this may be our last chance to save the restaurant. Your father needs full concentration right now. He's attempting to make the most difficult burger known to man. I've only seen him do it once successfully. And now he has to do it in a mini sampler size. What is it? He calls it "the meatsiah." It's beef tartare inside a burger medium-well inside a burger Wellington. Is dad gonna die? Maybe, honey, maybe. Oh, he has to be happy with that one. So how is this gonna save the restaurant? Am I gonna put on the burger suit and hand these out in front? Oh, no. We're going straight to the source with these. You're gonna be handing these out in Jimmy Pesto's restaurant. Whoa. That's right, whoa. These samples are gonna get us our rent money tonight, so we can keep this place. How are free samples gonna get us money? They'll try the samples, and they'll love 'em, but they'll want more. More! They'll be craving these burgers, itching to get their fix! Like hero1n. That's right son, like hero1n! Yes! But this family's gonna have to execute perfectly to pull this off... where's Louise? Louise (Dramatically): This one shall have his first gig. This one shall slow dance upon that one. And Mr. Jimmy Pesto's fate is yet undetermined, because I still need to get some of his hair. I'm gonna go get it right now. Wanna come? We want to stay here. Forever. We wanna stay here forever and ever. We want to be buried here! Buried here! Okay, I'll bury you when I get back. Jimmy: You're taking hair donations? That's right. Hm, for people with mustache cancer? Yeah, it's a serious disease. Hey, aren't you Bob's kid? (Chuckles) No! No, no. Dad, Frank and Zelda both got the scampi, and now they're in the bathroom puking. Oh, for God's sake. Where am I gonna get another piano player at this hour? We could put on some boyz ii men and I could slow dance. Hey, pepper, no! For the thousandth time, no! It's my passion, dad! Passion! (Scoffs) I know a guy. (Ringing) Hello, Bob's burgers. You tell dad where you were going? Mm, he's working on his burger bites. Hey, there's a drum set. Back me up! Sorry, it'll just be another minute. We're really backed up in there. Gene got his wish! The voodoo is working! How you doin'? Nice shirt. Oh, my God! Gene's first public performance! Bob: These are almost done. Is everybody ready? Aw! And my Tina's dancin'. My little clam's coming out of her shell! I'm just gonna slip out for one sec! Bob: Okay, here we go. Time to go win back the restaurant! Linda? Kids? Oh, my God. Gene was supposed to wear the costume. Well, you know what? I'll do this myself. This next number's a slow jam. It's called "three sides don't make a square." Ding, ding, ding... Yup. Thank you. (Chuckles) What happened, did you snap? Did Mr. fancy face take a trip to the sexy store? No. It's a little small on you. A little tight in the pickles, huh? What's on the tray? These are burger bites, Jimmy. The best in the world. I'm gonna show your customers what real food is. Here, try a real burger, sir. Hey. Yeah, well... Eh-eh. I'm gonna go this way then. Nah-nah-nah. Yeah. Well, then I'm... Whoa! Dah-dah. Don't poke me. Aah! Real burgers. Right across the street. Hey, hey. Just move. (Mocking): Eh, just move. Shut... what? I didn't do it. Yeah, I did it. (Both gibber mockingly) Oh, no. Is that dad? And you people! Traitors! Traitor family! It's Gene's first public performance! You could had me at the ground floor, dad. Now I play the big rooms. You gotta let the kids have a little fun. We have fun, Linda! We have lots of fun! What's he wearin'? My buns. With a few extra buns hanging out the back. (Rimshot) Oh! Hey, dad, I'm playing drums! (Sarcastically): Oh, I'm so happy you're playing drums, Louise! And you know what? You should keep your freaky kids locked up in your own place. What did you say about my kids? Hit him in his handsome groin! (Grunting) Wait. Watch it. You.... I'm gonna. Ow! Hey. Wait. Wait. (Both grunting) Get him, dad. Come on! Come on! Don't worry, dad! Anything? Anything? I got the samples, Bobby. Aw, crap. That looks silly. Come for the rent? Yes, I've come for the rent. Bob! No, no, let 'em fight. Looks like a betting crowd. Who wants three-to-one against the burger? Right here! Yeah, let me see. Let me see. Wanna, here... oh! Very nice, thank you. All right, it's a draw. Who had "they end up hugging each other"? Me. That's ten to you. Thank you. Now Bob, Jimmy, let's all go over to Jimmy's new gift shop... I mean... sorry... Bob's place... and settle this over some nice alcohol, hmm? Bob... Do you have the rent? (Sighs) No. Not all of it. Okay then. Here we go. Oh, God. Give me your hands. Uh... sure. Do you cry easily? Um... sometimes. Well, let's get it over with. Bob, I will not be renewing... (Sniffs) Oh, what is that amazing smell? Who's hungry?! What are those? Only the holy grail of hamburgers... the meatsiah! Hmm... Are these... choke-resistant? They're bite-sized! Oh, good. Mmm... mmm! Mmmmm! Huh? I have never... Eaten a burger... Half... (Choking) Hit him in the crotch! Oh, no, no. I'm just kidding. As good as this. This is great! Yeah! Oh, it's, it's complicated it's-it's mystical, it's-it's barbaric... Thank you. Mmm. Mr. Fischoeder, I wanted to... I'm talking, Jimmy. I want to... I'm talking. Bob, you might be the worst tenant I've ever had, and I rent space to a raccoon sanctuary. I know. They're next-door. I've been meaning to talk to you about.... Shh. It's okay. Right. I get it now. You were trying to tell me the other day, but I wouldn't listen because I was choking to d*ath. Mr. Fischoeder, I just have... Jimmy, please! Please! I was thinking about my life, you see, and how I didn't want it to end in your pathetic little restaurant on your sad, filthy floor. Hey! But now I see it. You're not a businessman. You don't care about customers and money! Ha! No, I do. I do. No, no, you are an artist... a beef artist. A be-fartist! A poet! Who writes with meat and buns and pickles. Like a greasy, heterosexual Walt Whitman. Uh... thank you. Okay. Well, Mr. Fischoeder, I... Jimmy! No, it's fair... Jimmy! ...To talk. Please. Which brings me to your lea... Just 'cause I'm not greasy... Shut up! Which brings me to your lease. Let's extend it! All right, Bobby! But I gotta make it month-to-month. Eh. Oh... Um... all right. We'll take it. And I have to raise your rent a little. Hmm. Okay. That's... yes. Eh. Both: Daddy! Andy, Ollie, what are you doing here? Both: Voodoo! What? Both: Voodoo! Yeah, and we switched underpants! (Whispers): Ollie, that was a secret! I couldn't hold it in anymore! Wait. These are your kids? And you thought my kids were freaky? Come on, boys, we're leaving. No! We wanna stay! Yeah, it's fun here! Yeah, Jimmy. It's fun here. Ehh... Shush. All right! Let's celebrate! Yes! Gene? Ah, do us the honor. A little music? (Gasps) You believe in me. Time to tickle the iron. A ding, a dong, a ding-dong-ding. Slow jam. (Sighs) Come on, Jimmy Jr., let's get back to work. No, dad! I'm gonna dance with Tracy! Tina. Tina! Yup, voodoo works. I'm a God! Teddy: Am I doing this right? Mort, do I look sexy? My pants aren't falling down, are they, Mort? When I dance, sometimes my pants fall down.
That was my butt. What are you looking at? Smart money's on boogers. It's not a booger. Let the man think for himself! I don't think it's a booger. Who asked you?! It's getting bigger. It knows what we're thinking. Huh. It is definitely growing. I just hope it's not that green mold. It's called green mold. You see it in a lot of beach towns, and filthy, disgusting, poorly managed restaurants. Hey! So, they had to send you, Hugo? There's no one else that does this? I just got mold-certified. In a month, I'll be cleared for vermin, too. Oh, congratulations. Okay, gene, if you eat this mold I'll give you five... Whoa. Mmm. Gorgonzola. So what do I got to do? Use bleach on it or something? (Chuckles) Use bleach on it? Oh, I'll just put bleach on it. No, of course not, Bob. I hate you. This is big. You have to close. The whole building will have to be tented for 48 hours. Great. There goes our weekend revenue. Ooh, two days off! Bobby, we could use it. I guess it has been a while since we've had a break. Yeah. Ten years. What? That's... can't be right. Ten years. You're really living the dream, Linda. Aren't you done, Hugo? Sure, Bob, I'm done. Mold! Dangerous k*ller mold! Floating d*ath spores! Everyone move! Gene, how are you feeling? Kind of nauseous. A little light-headed. Pretty good. Glad I ate it. You say that about everything. Yeah. Green mold, huh? Yeah. You ever dealt with this stuff, ? Oh, sure. We get all kinds of moldy bodies at the home. Not on the bodies. I mean on the walls or... And you should see the shut-ins. Stop. One guy's back looked like a putting green! Oh, dear lord. Hey, you got to get out of the apartment while the mold guys work, right? Yeah. We're going to go to a motel. And we're going to tear into that mini bar! Yeah, we're going to go on a bender. No, we're not. Yes, we are. I'm going to drink some baileys and unwind. Hey, guys, stay with me. No. I mean... I appreciate the offer, but I... Listen to me. I live alone in an enormous apartment. That happens to be above a funeral home. Hmm. So, come on, stay with me. Ah, thanks, ! Yeah! Yeah, yeah! Linda, seriously, you want to stay in a funeral home? Why not? Yes, yes! It'll be fun. Is it spooky? You mean, do I have a medicine cabinet full of corpse moisturizers? Ooh! Yes. Do they make my skin soft as a baby? You decide. (Gasps) It's not greasy, either. Tina, touch.

Yeah, the bus from speed. I didn't even know you liked that movie so much. I never saw it. I don't like to see the movie until I finish the model. Hmm. Makes it more fun.

But stay away from my computer. Not because of p*rn. This computer? Come on, now. What's this? No... Tina: "A dating web site for icians." , you got a message. Yeah.

Hey, she replied. Already? Too soon. Am I right? It's not a good sign. ", it's a date. See you at 8:00." She's a rhymer. Go, . I mean, it could be fun, two icians... Hey, what if you and Linda come, too? No. No... Yeah. A double date. Oh, but who would watch the kids? Right. Yeah. Tina can babysit. I can? Oh, come on. We're a little old to be babysat. Isn't that an outdated concept? No. Need I remind you what happened last time she was quote-unquote in charge? Free swim! Special delivery. (Coughs) Hobo dinner! Oh, pshh. We'll just be right across the street. Tina can call us on the emergency cell phone if she needs to. All right. You bought the ticket, you take the ride. Come on, Linda. We shouldn't go to this. It will be bad. Bob, we are going out tonight. All right, fine, fine. Yay! But just for a couple hours. And I'm wearing my lazy pants. Okay. And I'm gonna drink. A lot. Yay! Double date! All right! Linda (Laughing): Oh! I love it. I feel like we're in Jamaica! Ooh! Jamaican honeymoon. You be just in time for pasta-farian night with garlic dread-sticks, man... Stop! Groove with me to... Uh-uh!

Will you join me in the corner for a little powwow? Okay. You're dying out there, kid. Yeah. Everybody hates you. I know. I'm blowing it. Should I call for help on the emergency phone? Hold on. Maybe you should think outside the box. Okay. How many times in our life will we get a chance to wander unsupervised in a morgue? Yeah, won't that be scary? Tina, you don't babysit from here. You babysit from here. My boob? Yes. Your boob. Really? Yeah. What's your boob telling you, Tina? I don't know. (Muffled voice): Explore the morgue. Explore the morgue? That a girl! (Gene screaming) Sorry, just hungry. Bobby, they're playing our song. What? Our song isn't "ziti tonight." Oh, I think that's her! ? (Laughs) I recognize you from the picture on your web site. I'm Samantha. Well, it's quite a pleasure to meet you, Samantha. This is my friend Bob and his lovely wife Linda. Hi. Hi. We're on our honeymoon. Oh. Congratulations. Thank you. It's not our honeymoon. Well... technically. Not technically. First time to Jamaica. Oh, my God. Sorry for the smell. Long day slaving over the old embalming table.

With all this green mold around town, better hope not. What do you mean? You're joking, right? Only that green mold turns bodies into the living dead. Uh... Tina, you're a zombiephile. You should know this! I'm not a zombiephile. I have a complicated relationship with zombies. They're dangerous, but I love their swagger. "Funkytown" is by lips incorporated. I just remembered. The morgue. Well, here goes nothing. Tina: Uh... (Laughing) Every time they say something horrible, take a drink. Bob, stop. I'm doing it. So, what's the weirdest thing you've ever found in a human body? Here we go. You first. Light bulb. A football. A far side calendar. Really? Huh.

Oh, I feel like I could pass out. Anybody in there? Hmm. What is that, satin? Oh, man, that is calling our name, Keanu. (High-pitched): Get in there! Will do, buddy. (Groaning) Somebody close my bed. I'll get it. Unlock the door, Louise! We know you have the key. Nope. I ate it. We'll have to wait till it comes out. You never poop! We're doomed! Yep. (Snoring) What the hell? (Snoring) It's coming from the next room. She's messing with us again. No. I swear. I did this, but I am not doing that. (Snoring) I won't get fooled again. I am the babysitter.

TV weatherman: Ocean Avenue is gearing up for this year's Lobsterfest, and that mean ol' tropical storm we've been watching is movin' out to sea, which means perfect weekend weather! Ugh! Damn it! So if you think you hear thunder, it's just my stomach growling. (Laughing) Ha! I love Lobster. This guy is unbelievable. Stop pimping for Lobsterfest! And start primping for Lobsterfest. Mmm... (Making goofy sounds) Looking primpy. No, no primping for anything! Why are you so grumpy? Come on. You know why. It's no fun being a burger man in a seafood town. I hate Lobsters and their stupid fest. Plus, I'm allergic. No, you're not. Yeah. I'm allergic. Remember our first date? Yeah, I remember our first date. You were a nervous wreck. ♪ ♪ I was having an allergic reac... never mind. Hey, what are you guys looking at over there? Um, nothing. Just pictures of people... Doing it. Oh. Hey, wait a minute. That's not p*rn. You brought a Lobsterfest brochure into this house? Can we please go this year? Absolutely not. Ugh! But there's so much fun stuff happening. Unveiling of the world's largest butter vat, for instance. The coronation of the Lobster queen and her court of lovely Lobster maidens. Entertainment by John van horton & the music extrusion. Mm. I do love those guys. As a matter of fact, gene, you were conceived to a jvh song. And I plan to return the favor. (Bell tinkling) Oh, great. I mean, hi, Hugo. You know, I couldn't help but notice, Bob, uh, yours is the only window on the street without a Lobsterfest poster in it. Yeah. Why might that be? Well, because Lobsterfest is stupid! What? I'll handle this, Ron. Put the sign up. It's the law. It's the law? Martial law. I'm grand marshal of the fest this year! Hugo, such a fancy sash. You look like sissy spacek in Carrie. Ha. Oh, thank you. But, Hugo, as a health inspector, you must know how disgusting Lobsters are, right? They're bottom feeders that eat garbage all day. Huh, they like garbage? Then they must eat here! (Laughs) In your face, Bob. And now in your window! Come on, Ron. Let's make like a Lobster and get the shell out of here. All right. (Bell tinkling) Hey, my two best customers! Two burgers coming up. No burgers for me, Bob. I'm saving my appetite for Lobsterfest. None for me either, Bobby. I just come by to show you my new Lobster cracker. Check it out-- titanium with butter-resistant grips. It's the one the astronauts used. Teddy, you think the astronauts brought a Lobster cracker to space? Yeah. That's what it says on the box. Look. "The one the astronauts used in space!" I spent $49 on this. Hey, I bet you kids are old enough to crack your own claws this year, right? We don't celebrate Lobsterfest. What?! We're like Jews on Christmas. Or Jews for Jesus on hanukkah. Or me at a lesbian bar. Last night. Watched a hockey game at a lesbian bar, Bob. It was like I was invisible. Uh... And who knows the name of the delicious paste that collects here in the pancreas? Tomalley! Correct. (Clears throat) Excuse me, miss labonz? Yes, Louise. My family doesn't observe Lobsterfest. I should be excused from class, and/or given an a. Thank you. Good night. Louise, I don't normally use this argument, but if everyone else is doing it, you should, too. (Thunder crackles, rumbles) Huh. Attention, students. The tropical storm has changed course and has been upgraded to a hurricane. It could hit town at any moment. Don't worry. We have an emergency plan. It's called "talking it through." Now, who here thinks the hurricane was caused by something bad they did? What about you, Nicholas? That thing you told me? In confidence? Say it. I rub my genitals on the couch. Mm-hmm. We're all gonna die because of you! (Screaming) It's weather only a Lobster could love, but sadly, there will be no Lobsterfest. This reporter is getting his bib off. Ha, ha! Stupid, failure weatherman, and your failed Lobsterfest. Where's your ugly red sea bug God now?! All right, hold hands. Come on, down to the basement. Bob, we have to close. A hurricane is coming! I know. Isn't it great? Lobsterfest is cancelled! So this town is gonna be crawling with empty bellies ready to eat Bob's burgers, baby! Bob, you're crazy. I think you're crazy! 'Cause it's crazy not to sell burgers during a hurricane! Bob's burgers is open for business! (Thunder rumbling) Oh. (Electricity buzzing) Is that all you got, storm? Wind chimes! Aah! (Angry muttering) Bob, I'm not sure staying open is safe. Suppose the hurricane tears right through here. I'll chance it! Look who I found trying to stay dry in the bounce house. The entire royal court of Lobster maidens. Oh, you poor things! Welcome, your highnesseses. Uh, you are henceforth known as the royal cows. Bob! Ah, well, something like that. (Laughs) I'll go throw on some burgers. Hot coffee coming up! I'd really rather get my lips around that beer tap. Hi, guys. Hey, Gretchen! Hi! Oh, Lobster maiden! Teddy, this is Gretchen. She cuts my hair. How you doing? Hey, are you still working nights at the cop bar? Nah, there was a groping incident. (Gasps) I apologized, but they fired me anyway. (Laughs) Oh, she's too much. Really is. Hey, you open? Mm-hmm. You got food? Yup. Beer? Absolutely! Atmosphere? Yeah... nnnn... eh... Ah, good enough. Whoa, Bobby. I think this might develop into a party type situation! You kids stay down in the basement. I already picked a corner for the bathroom. That one, where I went. And I picked that corner. Hey, we've got two bathrooms! Mom, I'm coming up! Linda: Just stay down there. They're gonna need you to help repopulate the earth when this is all over. Ew! You want us to mate with each other?! Linda: No, you'll mate with the other kids in other basements. Keep talking. All right! Jvh unplugged! Look at all that wet gray hair. Oh, Bobby, look at Hugo. Oh, and poor wet Ron. Yeah.

I want to thank you for bringing us in, Bob. It was totally Linda's idea. She is so damn considerate! You have everything, and I have nothing. God, so alone! Mm. (Slurps) Lobsterfest was all I had. And now that's gone, too. Look at me. I'm a joke! Yeah, that's too bad. Hey, Bobby, some of the Lobster maidens are open to the idea of a wet gown contest. Want to put up a prize? Uh, how about a towel? Ha! Oh, my God. That's so funny. (Laughing) Gretchen, have you, uh, met Hugo? He was gonna be grand marshal at, uh, Lobsterfest. Ooh. Nice sash. Ever take it off? Well, actually, on Monday, I have to dry-clean it and give it back. Uh, Hugo, Gretchen is into authority figures. Cops, firemen, even mailmen, if they have an important route. Oh, my gosh. So am I! What, you're into mailmen? Well, if they have an important route. I think what Bob's saying is, she likes a man with a badge. You have a badge. Hey, Gretchen! Huh? Hey, Hugo's also a health inspector. That's like being a food sheriff. This is my badge. Mm. Kind of small. You got a g*n? Uh, no. Actually, I'm not, uh... Mm. ...Licensed to carry a firearm.

Looting?! So how do we do this looting thing exactly? It's easy. You grab anything that's not nailed down. Anything? Like this brick? It's yours. Free brick! Free quarter. Free phone numbers. Free seaweed. Gene, free plywood. Whee! Hey, Bob, the cash register won't open, and you're serving burgers so fast, I don't even know who to get an iou from. Relax, Linda. I'll take care of it. Ugh.

This is our one chance to see (Gene yelling) What everyone else is talking about. What do you mean? Gene: Aah! We're gonna eat Lobster tonight! But that goes against everything we were raised to believe in! Aah! It doesn't go against everything. (Chuckles) Okay, but it's a start. Aah! Now's our chance to taste the forbidden fruit that has been kept from us our whole lives. Are you with me? Yeah! Okay. And one man's generosity has turned Lobsterfest into bobsterfest. We're trying to get a word with Bob himself here. I love you, Scott bags! Yeah, there's a cable on that. You can't go all the way over there. You come with me! Yeah, okay. You come with me!

(Birds chirping) You were the hurricane, schmuck! (Groaning) Hey, Gretchen. (Sighs) Do you have some sweat pants I can put on? Uh... Linda. I don't feel well. I can't even look at you. I don't feel well. I did this? You and the mob you incited with free beer and burgers. Oh, who bent my little spindle thing? That's what you notice?! Okay, lin, it looks bad now, but we made a lot of new friends last night. Once word spreads that Bob needs help, this place will be jammed again. The biggest problem is gonna be finding a job for everybody who wants one. Gee, I'm worried about this; I really love it. ♪ ♪ 

  Louise: Okay, technical problems from last night have been resolved. Hair dryer plus waffle iron plus toaster equals boiling water. So how do we k*ll this guy before we boil him? We could teach the Lobster to drive and wait until it gets into an accident. Or we could hire an assassin. No, idiots, you boil Lobsters alive. What?! That doesn't sound right. Yep. Until he's dead. And then we boil him some more. Here we go. Wait, this does not feel right. Doing it in a dark room with toilet paper around my neck? I thought my first time eating Lobster would be special. Deejay: And now please join Mr. and Mrs. Jimmy junior as they eat their first Lobster! Mmm, mmm... I thought my first time eating Lobster would be different, too.

What's the matter with you two? Come on, Louise, is this really how you imagined your first time? Yes. (Sighs) Okay, not quite. Man: Louise, today you pay the super price for your super crimes. Enjoy your last meal. It'll do just fine... In a pinch! Aah...! Maybe we have been rushing things. I want to wait till I'm ready. Let's not give in to peer pressure. Let's release the Lobster back into the supermarket from whence he came! I guess you're right. Looks like this guy'll be the one that got a... whoa! Woops! I guess we're having Lobster.

Hey, I hooked you two up last night, and you guys kind of broke the baby-changing station in the bathroom. (Giggles) Slap him with a citation, Hugo. I want to watch. Baby likes civil authority? Yes, I love civil authority. I'll show baby civil authority. Stilts guy! You fell through my window. Lot of glass on the floor. Where you going? Got to go, Bob! If I stay still too long, I fall over!

No, he doesn't. Does he? Looks like an allergic... (Gasps) Did you eat Lobster?! I, uh... He refuses to answer that. What's wrong with you people! Look at my son! Hello. You did this! You and your disgusting food fetish! Bob, get off the stage! You're disorderly. Oh, yeah? Maybe I should get disorderly with this Lobster pot here. That's right, you heard me-- you trash my restaurant, I trash Lobsterfest, starting with this Lobster pot. Ow! It's hot. Let's leave that alone. Oh, but I-I see some butter. You wouldn't like it if someone messed with your precious butter! Like stuff a big, hairy toe in it! (People screaming) Bob, put your foot back in your sock slowly.

(People screaming) Bobby, are you okay? Excuse me, uh, excuse me. Oh, my God! All the butter's been contaminated by Bob, and there isn't any more in town! (Screams) Bob destroyed Lobsterfest! Can't you just eat Lobster without butter? No! How? That's an outrage! Well, why don't you call it butterfest? It brings out the succulence, jerk! Yeah! So what should we do with him? Throw him in the shell pile! Shell pile? Shell pile! Shell pile! All (Chanting): Shell pile! Shell pile! Shell... Oh, boy. Excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Maybe Bob shouldn't have threatened your butter, and he definitely should have charged you for the burgers. Boo...! But he opened his beautiful heart last night, and you boiled it alive like a Lobster! All you're doing is making us angrier! (Muffled): Shell pile! All (Chanting): Shell pile! Sorry, Bobby, I used a bad analogy. Hugo, this doesn't seem right. What? I have a girlfriend; Bob's about to be thrown on to a shell pile-- I've had this exact fantasy. Ron: Come on, Hugo.

She said she was more than I could handle. Oh. It was ugly. She said she didn't mind a small badge, but said I didn't know how to use it, Bob! Ow. Ouch. Oh, that's too bad. I don't need your pity!

Bob's Burgers! Fresh ground meat! Great atmosphere! (guttural horn blast) Gene, bring it in. Get out of that burger suit. We're going. Baseball waits for no one. (sniffs) It smells like urine. Did you pee in that? I had to go! I told you not to pee in it after I cleaned up from the... I'm the only one who wears it. What's the difference? Oh, my God. What, you don't want to buy burgers from a guy who smells like pee? No one can place where it's coming from. I can't believe you'll close the restaurant to go to a baseball game. Louise, this isn't just a game. We bought an ad at the ballpark. That's worth closing for, right? Oh, can't wait to see it! It's gonna be so exciting. We're famous. It looks like a hot dog wrapper's stuck in the net. Like, a really tiny hot dog. I did think it was gonna be a little bigger. I think more people would see your ad if it was a urinal cake. Are you kidding? I wish I could afford a urinal cake ad. All this talk about cake is making me hungry. I'm gonna flag down the ice cream sandwich guy. Hey! Play ball! Welcome to opening day of minor league baseball. Let's hear it for your Wonder Wharf Wonderdogs! Please give a big Wonderdog welcome to Phe-Nom, the Korean bunt specialist! I never realized baseball had so much butt-touching. That's how they communicate, Tina. It's like Braille, but with butts. Read this! (groans) I'm bored. Boredom. Boring sports. Hey, it's the seventh- inning stretch. Time for the mascot race. Well, hello! Please welcome the owner of the Wonderdogs, Mr. Calvin Fischoeder! Fish! It's that time. Now cheer for your favorite mascot! Mr. Fischoeder owns the team? He owns the ballpark, the team, Wonder Wharf. I'm gonna marry that man. No, you're not. I wanna be rich! Don't be frightened. I have a g*n! So, get set... (fans cheering) Where has this sport been all my life? You know, I wear the burger costume all the time. Maybe I could race in one of these races, Dad. Bob: I bet it's impossible to get in, Gene. I'm sure you gotta know someone. You do. It's Mr. Fischoeder, our landlord. The winner! Well, I can't ask a favor of a guy I've never paid rent on time to. You're his son, Gene. He'll ask him. Yay! No, I won't. Now taking the mound to pitch, former major league sensation, Torpedo Jones! That can't be the same Torpe... Kids, that's the Torpedo Jones! I can't believe he's still playing. God, he, he must be... my age. I speak for everyone here when I say I don't know what a Torpedo Jones is. Let me tell you, nobody... We don't care. Gene, let me finish. Nobody... That's what I was trying to prevent. Nobody pitched like Torpedo. I was there for his greatest moment: "The Pitch!" It was 15 years ago, but I remember it like it was ten. His pitch was the split-finger skadootch. Torpedo clinched the pennant for us with that pitch. If he's so good, why have we never heard of this guy? Well, because he didn't last long in the bigs. You know, the skadootch is just one of those pitches. When it was on, it was really on. But when it wasn't... it's like hitting candy out of a baby's hand... with a bat. Wait. You mean it's hard because babies hands are so small? No, it's easy because... How could you hit a baby? Nobody would hit a baby's hand with a bat in real life. I don't understand. Was he fired from the bigs 'cause he hit a baby with a bat? I'm not interested in talking to you anymore. Sorry, Gene. I don't see Fischoeder anywhere. Let's get going. That's all right. I only wanted to do it really, really bad. Oh! There's Torpedo! Dad, ask Torpedo about the mascot races. Maybe he can get Gene in. Yeah! Kids, come on. I can't bother Torpedo. He's, like, my role model. Oh, that's creepy. Your role model is the same age as you? I would never have another nine-year-old as my role model. Hey, Torpedo! My dad is a huge scout for the Baseball League of America! Kidding. But he has a favor to ask you. (chuckles) Hi, I'm a huge fan. You know, I was there for "The Pitch." So, uh, what can I do for ya? Picture? Autograph? Three bucks each, both for five. Uh, yeah, both would be great. Dad! Oh, and my kid wants to run in the mascot race. You don't think... Hey, Russell! Some kid here wants to run in a mascot race. For you, Torpedo, I'll make it happen. I gotta free up one of these outfits. No, you don't! I got my own. It's a burger. Easy enough. Thanks a lot, Torpedo. Good luck out there, sport. Linda, did you, did you hear that? Torpedo Jones called me "sport." He didn't call you "sport," he called Gene "sport." No, he was looking right at me. Yeah, he called me "sport" and he tussled my hair. It was great, Gene. You were great. I'm a great tussle receiver. Wow, wearing the burger suit in the mascot race, Gene. That's advertising, huh? Don't touch me! It was so nice of Torpedo to give us these seats so we can watch Gene's race. You can really make out the players' tattoos from here. Tina: Makes you wonder about the tattoos we can't see. (quietly): On their butts. How you doing, Gene? You feeling fast? No, I feel queasy. Got some butterflies, Ace? Torpedo! Want my advice, kid? It's a mascot race; all you gotta do is stay on your feet. Let the other guys trip over themselves. It's time for the mascot race! Whoo-ee! Goodie. Remember, you're an ambassador for our restaurant, so just y y and run well, 'cause you don't run well. Good luck out there, sport. Oh. Yeah, I thought earlier you called me "sport," so... Nah, that was, that was a nickname for the kid there, Flash. I'll take Flash. Kids, call me Flash from now on. Let's split the diff and call you Stinky. Stinky! I like it! Oh, Torpedo, here's a little thank you for getting Gene in the race. I make burgers for a living, so it's not weird for me to give you this. I don't think it's weird at all, Bob. Like a good burger. Mmm. That's a good burger. Finish this guy back on the mound. Ha! Torpedo Jones just said I make a good burger! I want that on my tombstone. Seriously, okay? No, I already got your tombstone picked out for ya. What, what is it? It says, "Order up." (chuckles) That's good. Let's go with that one. Joining your Wonder Wharf mascots today is a special guest food, a burger! A boy who is also a burger. And I have my g*n. Ready, set... Go get 'em, Gene! I reinforced the crotch so he wouldn't tear it. Win, Gene! Avenge Dad's d*ath! Burt: Down goes Sammy Sea Lion! (making expl*si*n noises) Ooh! It's a two-mascot race! Burger and Captain Pel I. Can. There they go, like two, fast, fiery... bew...! (panting) The burger is your winner! (mimics trumpet fanfare) Well, congratulations, young burger. Ladies and gentlemen, you can purchase delicious burgers that look somewhat like him right here at the park. And at my family's restaurant. And, uh, what's the name of that restaurant? Ah... it's, it's... Bob's Burgers! God, I'm there every day. Bob's Burgers! It's... Oh, God... Gene! No! Never mind. Never mind. That's okay. Bob's Burgers! Oh, my God! You can get everything you expect from a burger at whatever the name of his restaurant is... Oh, oh, I just remembered! I just remembered! It's too late. But you can get them here at the park, today. No! Say it! I won something! I won! I won! I won something! Yeah, and you didn't fall down like everyone else. Tell that to your grandkids. I will. Gene, are you kidding me?! The name of the restaurant is Bob's Burgers! Well, I call you Dad! I think of it as Dad's Burgers! You live above it! You work in it every day! Bob, calm down. Calm down. Calm down. I'm sorry, Dad. I'm fine. I'm fine. He did great. You did great, Gene. A gold medal! Oh, we should get that bronzed! Strike three. You're out! Torpedo's split-finger skadootch has suddenly started clicking. I love that burger of yours, Bob. Hey, after the game, let's all go to Bob's Burgers! Whoo! Now that's advertising, huh? Ooh, Angel! Do they call you that 'cause you're such a good boy? I did many bad things to escape Cuba. Things that haunt me in the dark of the night. Aw... How about another beer? Man, you kids got a great dad, you know that? One wife. One family. That's the way to do it. You know, in the majors, most guys got a whole bunch of families spread out over the 50 states. When spring training starts, you get your Florida wife. When it's regular season, it's open season, if you know what I'm talkin' about. You kiss your home field wife and kids good-bye, you tell 'em you'll miss 'em, and you do. But you still take some of their toys and re-gift 'em for your away kids. I bet you're a great dad. And three great husbands. Mr. Torpedo, I couldn't help but notice that the tall boy was looking a little lethargic. Yeah, he's got Lupus or rickets or somethin'. I don't know why we keep giving that job to these sick kids. I was wondering if I could offer my services. I'm very healthy. (grunting) Okay, okay, okay. Whoa, whoa. Hey, you got the job. Just stop doing that. Here's your first ball girl duty: bringing me one of your dad's burgers before every gam Okay. Here's the tabacco you wanted. And your comic books. (speaking Spanish) Phe-Nom, is it possible to be in love with 25 people at once? (quietly): You're my favorite. Don't tell Angel. He's fiery. Strike three! (crowd cheering) Sound the alarm because Torpedo is on fire! (mimics alarm) Fire! Fire! Fire! Not a good idea, Burt. It's a crowded stadium. That Torpedo is amazing! Has he always been this good? No, he hasn't been good in a long time. He says my burgers have helped him pitch better. How does a burger help someone pitch better? Here ya go, Bob, little souvenir. (chuckles) Thanks, buddy! Whoa, slippery. It's greasy, huh? (sniffs) What does this smell like? Hey, stop sniffing Torpedo's balls. (laughs) Get it? It's like you're in love with him. (sniffs) Wait. That's our burger. Oh, crap. Torpedo's putting my grease on the ball. That's how his skadootch is skadootching so much. Your hero's using your burger grease to win. That's great! No, Lin, Torpedo is using my burger grease to cheat. Oh. So you helped Torpedo cheat. If that means the Wonderdogs keep coming to the restaurant bringing all sorts of business with them, I say big whoop, let the old man throw a greasy skadootch. Umpire: Strike two! (sighs) I don't even know what to think about this. I gotta go take a leak. Oh, get me an ice cream in a mini-helmet! Bob. You look glum. Oh, I, uh... You... don't hold your... when you pee. Why? It's not going anywhere. Okay. Um, well, what if you found out that someone you knew was doing something sort of bad, and you were helping them do that sort of bad thing... Is it me? Is it abortions? Wait. What? Uh, what were you saying? Torpedo Jones is greasing the ball, and he's using my grease to do it. Mm-mm. Oh. Come walk with me. Come behind the scenes! Torpedo's dazzling pitching is putting more butts in seats than this stadium can handle. Is the roller coaster going to be okay without those huge planks of wood? Sure, sure! These people aren't paying for extra wood, Bob. No one wants to ride Extra Wood Mountain. Whoa! Watch out! Extra nuts and bolts. Ow! People come to baseball games for the same reason they come to the amusement park: To be entertained! Does it really matter if the games are rigged? No! The games are rigged? Yes! Oh. My wonderdog is hanging out. (chuckles): Yes. Yes, it is. I got so caught up in our conversation, I forgot to zip. Yeah, I didn't want to say anything. Why not? I, uh... Compliments are welcome. Where was I? You were saying the games are rigged. Yes. The games are all rigged. I'm not letting my kids play these games anymore. But look at these smiling faces. Just like those smiling faces. Smiling at every skadootch the Torpedo throws. They don't want to know, Bob. They don't want to look behind the curtain. I don't know. It just seems like bad karma or something. Karma? There's no such thing as karma. (laughs) Not in this town. Oh, just kick 'em. Kick 'em right into the ocean! Okay. That's it. Wait, why does Tornado want our old grease in a jar? It's Torpedo, Gene. Oh. Uh, it helps him pitch better. And-And don't forget, it's a secret. Why? Is it against the rules? Technically, yes. So then it's cheating. No. What it is, is helping people enjoy baseball more. It's entertainment. I'm confused. Are you and Mom getting divorced? What? Oh, my God, you are. I call Mom! I call Dad! You guys took both of them. Enough. Go fill the condiments. I call ketchup! I call mustard! Aw... You can do horseradish. There's not... okay. Thanks, Bobby. Hey, who wants a burger? On the Torpedo! Hooray! Gene, you're defending your title. Are you nervous? Why don't you ask my diarrhea. You should be nervous. You're a chubby kid in a mascot suit. That's what I'm saying. I should cheat. Dad says it's okay when it's for entertainment. That's right! Let's cheat! You see that pelican? Gene: Yeah. You're running, right? You have a switchblade taped to your shoe. He does? He will. And on your other shoe, you'll have a lemon. Stab! Stab! Stab! Sting, sting, sting! "What are you doing?" "I'm squeezing lemon into your wound!" Sweet baby blade foot. Or... I can give him a nudge and tip him over. Ugh, really? Yeah. He's top-heavy. I'll just give him a little tippity-tap. Well, I'm still gluing a knife to my foot. (starter pistol fires) 

  Yay, Gene! Go, Gene! That-a-way, son! Tippity-tap. (grunts) Burt: Ooh! It's a three-mascot pileup! Go, Gene! All right! Go! Phil: The Boy Burger wins again! How about that? Burt: Hey, how about this, Phil? (makes whooping siren sound) I don't know, Burt. I'm not so sure about that. Yay! I won! I won again! My brother won! Guys, take off your shirts. (grunting) Good arm pumping, baby! That's how I disguised the push. What push? He pushed the Cotton Candy mascot so he'd fall over. Hooray for cheating! Gene, how could you? You know that's wrong. Uh-uh. Not when it's entertainment. You said it yourself. You told them cheating is okay? No, I didn't, Linda. Yes, he did. Oh, Bobby. Oh, crap. Go get me a soft serve. And make it a swirl! Look, Gene, when I said it's okay to cheat, I meant for Torpedo, not for you to cheat in your mascot race. You should really give back one of those medals. Ooh, but I want to get a picture of you wearing them before you do. I'm not giving back my medals! Those suckers got their money's worth, Pops. I'm good for business, Dad. You know what? From now on, there'll be no more cheating. Does that mean I shouldn't give Torpedo this grease? That's right, Tina. Yes. No more cheating for anyone in this house. From now on, I won't wear my tummy tuck jeans. And good-bye, Brazilian. Hello, rain forest. Sorry, Dad. But if I win tomorrow, I'll be the first mascot ever to win three races in a row. I'm a top! You mean you're on top. No. I'm a top! (groans) Shew. I was starting to think maybe you were going to leave me high and dry here. Well, what's in this jar is worth the wait. What the...? "You don't need to cheat. "You can win without me. "If you try your hardest, you've already won. Love, Bob's grease." That's right, Torpedo. You can win without my grease. It just took me believing in you. Now, listen. Gene's about to race, and since you're his role model, I'm hoping you'll tell Gene he can win without cheating, just like you. Who the hell's Gene? That's... my son. You're his role model, and you're my role model, too. Wh...? I can't be your role model; we're the same age. What's this mean? You cutting me off, Bob-o? Torpedo, I'm cutting you free. Come here. Wait, what are you going to do? I'm going to hug you. Slow down there, tiger. Guess I'll have to make this grease last the whole season. I should have never given you my grease. I created a monster. You think you started my greasing? I've always cheated, Bobby. Not the... "The Pitch." Oh, definitely "The Pitch." Torpedo: That game, I had a pat of butter in my nostril, s*x jelly in my armpit... Hell, I was on prescription drugs to stimulate production of earwax. And "The Pitch"? That was courtesy of some black market whale blubber I bought off some Eskimos. Cute note, though, Bob. Bit of advice: if you want a role model, pick an old guy. By the time you grow up, they're dead. (sighs) Didn't go great. Gene! I'm sure it was fine. Torpedo seems like a reasonable guy. Torpedo Jones wants you out of his seats this second. What a schmuck. Gene! Phil: It's the seventh-inning stretch. Mascots are lining up. All right, maybe I have an idea. Hi, fellas. I'd love to say a few words to my son, the burger, over the P.A. Excuse me. Uh... okay. Highly unusual. Doesn't matter. None of this matters. Gene. Bob (over P.A.): Up here. Jesus? No, Gene, it's your father. I'm up here. You're dead?! Yes. (gasps) No, I'm-I'm kidding. I'm up here in the booth. Right here. See me? (sniffs) Boy, this microphone smells like beer. Well, let's just say AA was "A" waste of time. Winning isn't everything, Gene. Yes, we're all here to be entertained, but if you, um, cut corners now, the next thing you know, you'll be hiding lard in your nose or taking wood out of roller coasters. Hey, all right, that's enough of that. Let's start the race! I'm trying to talk to my son. Gene, run clean. Burt: On your mark! Gene, what are you going to do? I don't know. You're going to cheat! That's what you're going to do! You're going to win by cheating! (panting) Who wants to see the burger win three in a row? (cheering) Gene, listen to me. You know what to do. Bob... triple crown for burger. Good for your business. See?! No, Gene! Don't worry about the advertising. What are you doing? It's a starter's pistol. It's a real g*n. You should get down. Bob: What?! Stop sh**ting! This is crazy. Oh, good. He stopped. He's just out of bullets. And down goes Cotton Candy! It's a two-mascot race. Gene. Do the right thing. Yeah. You can win on your own, Gene! Probably. (slow-motion): Hey... All right. Fine. (yells) Louise: Whoa, whoa! Don't push him! He was going to push you! Burt: Congratulations to Captain Pel I. Can! Oh, Gene. Sorry, buddy. I mean, looks like karma caught up to you. Bob, I told you there's no such thing as karma. Uh, yes there is. No, I'm afraid there isn't! I'm afraid there is. Is not. Oh, crap. See, Gene. This is what happens when you cheat. That was incredible! Cheating is amazing! (groans): Oh. Bob? Oh. Uh, hi. Sorry about your roller coaster. Ah, roller coasters come and go. But Bobs are once in a lifetime. I admire you. You do? You remind me of my father. He was honest, and he worked hard. You an immigrant, Bob? Um... no. Just swarthy? I guess. What's "swarthy"? Um, dark and hairy. That's you! And me in the future. Well, unlike you, my father made a fortune. But in many other ways, you guys are the same. Two decent, swarthy peas in a pod. One rich and one... just scraping by. Thanks. Well, we're off to get a massage. Come on, Wonderdog. Down, boy. He's gone, Dad. My future husband's gone. You drove him away! Tina, what you got there? The team signed a ball so I'd have something to remember them by. And I took this jockstrap. (chuckles): Okay, sweetie. Let's throw that in the wash. No. Come on, give it to me. Mm-mm. Do you know how many venereal diseases those baseball players have? I don't care. Whose was it? Smells like Angel. Angel. Tina: But don't tell Phe-Nom.
(Slow beeping) (steady quick beeping) Dig, Gene! (Gene yells, Louise sputters) Show me the treasure! Maybe it's some tin foil and we can recycle it. Maybe it's a shovel, and I won't have to dig with my hands. Look! It's a watch! (Coughing) Ollie? How long have you been down there? Where's Andy? He was supposed to unbury me. There you are! I've been digging all over for you! Is your brother around? He's over there playing with Zeke. Okay, Jimmy Jr., put me in a crotch-lock and see if I can get out of it. (Grunting) Zeke. This is why I'm only friends with women. Pull the key out! They're on the wrestling team together. Pull the key out! I could help you practice, Jimmy Jr. Tomorrow's good for me. Thanks, but me and Zeke are going to watch them demolish that taffy factory tomorrow. We're gonna watch it get blowed up. Boom! (expl*si*n noises) (Zeke and Jimmy Jr. grunting) Zeke: Scoop. Jimmy Jr: Ow! Ah! Tina, Gene, let's go. (Zeke grunting) We've got a whole beach to comb. Yes, sir. I'm good. Come on! Hah! (grunts) Teddy: Bobby, want to come over and watch the game tonight? I'm making a three-bean salad, but it's bring your own bean. Can I put you down for garbanzo? No. Nah, he can't. (Sing-song): Bob's got plans tonight. (chuckles) Yeah, Teddy. Um... Sunday nights me and Linda have, uh, you know, an arrangement. (Linda and Bob chuckle) Oh! Scheduled s*x. Eh... Do you want to borrow my Sade tape? And I found this on the beach. I think it could help me. Ooh. Passionfruit paperbacks. Juicy! Too bad you kids can't take the metal detector over to Caffrey's taffy factory. Find his secret treasure before they tear the place down. Whoa, whoa, whoa... ho, secret treasure? What are you, ah... What are you talking about? Whoops, there I go again. Divulging amazing secrets. Yeah, my Uncle Paddy told me about it. He used to work in Caffrey back in the '50s. He was his maid. Your Uncle Paddy was a maid? All maids were men back then. Until women joined the workforce and took all the maid jobs away. All right, girls! Go, girls! A big part of Paddy's job was dusting Caffrey's money. Caffrey didn't make his money from candy, you know. He was a bootlegger! I believe the term is leg-warmer. No it is not, Gene. Anyway, Caffrey ran liquor during Prohibition. There are tunnels under the factory where they brought the booze in with boats at high tide. And the tunnels were booby trapped to keep out the G-men... Louise: Lousy Feds. Teddy: Rumor is Caffrey even made a bunch of taffy dummies to guard his operation. Like the Terra Cotta Warriors of ancient China. China. Stick to noodles, right? Is that r*c1st? Yes. A little bit. No. Anyway, Caffrey didn't trust banks, so he hid all his gold down there in the tunnels. Mm-hmm... Uncle Paddy told me about it, and now I'm gonna tell you. There's a secret elevator in the factory that takes you down to the tunnels underneath. Uh-huh. Continue. Yep. Uh... You follow the tunnel around the curve till you get to three stones, and then you take the tunnel that bends this way, and there's the treasure! (laughs) It's a butt! Get it? A butt! With three turds! Eh, Paddy got me good with that one when I was a kid and now I'm paying it forward. Eh... Yeah, that's a... That's a great one, Teddy. (Faking laughter) Teddy (laughing): Gold? He was a funny man, that Paddy. Eh... A funny male maid. With a serious drinking problem and psoriasis. Kids-only meeting. Now. I'll get Mom. No, Ti-Tina! Kids! Listen, let's go get the taffy factory treasure! We've got the map! But it's just a butt! Teddy was just messing with our heads. Men do that. No, no, this might be real. Think about it. If you had the chance to make a treasure map in a shape... what shape would you make it? Butt. Butt. Exactly! The factory's getting demolished tomorrow, so we have to go tonight. You guys in? We doing this? I could move some things around. Let's find butt treasure! Oh. Well, I am done. No more chewing for me. Look at the time. Yeah! I'm gonna sleep like a baby. (Very quietly): A horny baby. Ooh. Ah... Great dinner, Mom. You outdid yourself. That was a great day all around. One for the books. I want to go to bed immediately before I spoil it and make it just a regular day. (Quietly): That was easy. That was easy. (Whispers): Gene, you don't need to do that. Their door is shut. I know. My belly itches. Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm. Louise: There it is, guys. Caffrey's treasure is as good as ours. And no one knows about it! (Bike bell rings) Louise: What is Jimmy Jr. doing here? I invited him. What?! This book is gonna be my treasure map to Jimmy Jr.'s heart. All I have to do is act like this damsel. Hey, Tina. Oh, sorry I got dirt on your leg. Oh, my. H-How will I ever get clean? Um, hose it off? (Whispers): Yes. See that fishtail, J-Ju? Zeke?! Jimmy Jr., you don't just invite someone without asking! Yeah! Yeah, we're in agreement on that, Tina! Okay, good. Oh, Tina! Whoo! What are we waiting for? That factory's got windows and I got a passion for smashin'. Heeyah! Anyone else coming? Just Andy, plus one. That's Ollie. We made it! I got a funcussion! Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. That one didn't hurt. Ow! Doofus, Brace-face, Dingle, Berry, Gas Tank, Blabbermouth. Just so you know, we're not sharing the treasure with you, you, you and you. Jimmy, the way the moonlight shines on your hair makes me feel so... vulnerable. Yeah... it makes me feel like... dancing! (Grunting) Yeah, J-Ju, faster! (Glass shatters) Abandoned warehouse! Pent-up feelings! Footloose it! Don't tell me not to dance, Dad! (Sighs in disgust) We need to find that secret elevator and get down to the gold. I can taste every flavor from the past 60 years! I can taste the Korean War! I taste rust. I taste Andy's spit! Come on! What? The elevator! This means Uncle Paddy was right! There's treasure down there! You're welcome. Tonight's gonna be a little special. I got a couple of surprises. Not Teddy's Sade tape... Dice? Sexy dice. We roll them and they tell us what to do. Okay. Um, sounds... sexy. Ooh, let's... "hug". On the... (gasps) "chair." So, you're gonna hug on a chair? Mm-hmm. Come. That's, uh... Come to Momma. Ahh. Oh! (Strained): Get off. Um... oh. Get off. There we go, that's better. Whew. So that's it for that. So how do we work this thing...? What's this one do? Ah. What's happening? It must be a booby trap! Pull a different lever! No rush. (Gene grunts) (screaming) Louise: Push the other way! Linda: Nang, nang, nang, nang, nang, nang, nang, nang... nang... oh, good ear massage. Uh. Oh, Bobby. Aang, nang, nang, nang. All right, let-let's see what we got next. All right? I'm gonna roll. Ugh. I got "lick" "foot" again. (Gasps) Lick it like you like it. No. Lick it like you like it. No more lick foot. Lick it like you like it. Lick... No more lick foot. This little piggy goes all the way home. Hey, let's give these dice a little help. Let's do this... and this. (Dirty chuckle) That's weird. Well, it's about to get weirder with this and this. No, it's just, do you hear the kids? Huh. They're never this quiet. I'm gonna go check on them. (Gasps): Aw! (Gasps): I knew he didn't take out the garbage. Tina. Bobby, they're gone! What do you mean, "they're gone"? They're not here. I got Tina's diary. Let's see if it says anything. Tina: Dear Diary, tonight we're sneaking into the dangerous taffy factory. Also, if boys had utuses they'd be called duderuses. (chuckling): Duderuses. Bob! They went to the taffy factory! We gotta get them! Really? Yes. All right. Bringing you guys along was a big mistake. Between you inviting half of the town, and you pushing and licking everything in sight like an animal... You guys are a burden... you are dead weight! What are you doing now, Gene? I'm being courteous! I'm using the fart escape. There's an opening there? Yeah. But it's full of farts. (Sniffs, groans) I can fit through there and shimmy down those ropes. I am ditching you dipsticks. Wait! We can fit through there too, and Ollie can see in the dark. And Andy knows all the capitals. Albany, Montgomery, Juneau, Phoenix, Boston, Montpelier, Helena, Boise... Brr, it sure is cold in here. I wish some strong, chivalrous man would lend me his jacket. Or pants... Ow. Wash 'em before you return 'em! (Rat squeaks) The treasure's in the crack of the ass, and it's close. I can smell it. Okay, I need one of you in front of me and one of you behind me at all times, in case there are booby traps. Booby, booby, booby, booby. Booby, booby, booby, booby, booby. Sph! Sph! Zip it! Zip it! Oh! Nice try, Caffrey. Would one of you be a lamb and pull that string? Oop. Oh. It was nothing. Was nothing. Well, that was probably more menacing back in the day. This thing's stuck. What should we do now, Jimmy Jr? You're smart. While you guys keep on blabbity blabbity blabbity blabbity blabbity, I'm getting outta here. Yeah. Yeah. You go. (Grunting) Come on, J-Ju. Saddle up! Okay. I mean, hell yeah! Let's do it to this! No! I... I mean let's all go! Come on, Gene! I just got comfortable. It took me five minutes to cross my legs. Now! (whimpers) Ugh. I'm okay. He's gone. I thought Jimmy Jr. and I would have a romantic night in the sewer together, like Fabrizio and Fay. Tina, honey, it's pretty obvious Jimmy Jr.'s not into you. And I'm usually not that good at picking up on vibes. Did you know Mom and Dad were a thing? (Moans) 

  Louise (echoing): Damn it, Ollie! Andy: I'm Andy. Louise: Damn it, Andy! Louise, which way did you go? Louise: Oh, you can't tell? That's too bad! Don't follow me! You'd just fall into every single booby trap that has ever... (Louise screams) Every single trap that's ever been what? Hm. Silent treatment. Kind of weird to start in the middle of a sentence, but whatever. Oh my God, Bobby, I hope we find the kids before they hurt themselves. Oh, oh. Quit poking me with that thing. I'm sorry. I can't help it. I don't understand... why is it still here? Well... I may have slipped a pen1s pill into your casserole. Surprise. What? Wh-Why? Sometimes you want to ride a roller coaster twice and you don't want to wait in line. That's crazy. Where... where'd you get it? Ginger. She does it with Tony all the time. I want to be edgy like them. Pill-popping s*x freaks. Well, what am I supposed to do with this now? That thing made the kids; Maybe it can find them. Where are they? You know, come on, get out of there. Come on. Where are they? Show me, girl. Wait. Why is it a girl? 'Cause it's a pretty brunette, like Catherine Zeta-Jones. Oh, crap. Andy! Ollie! Go get help! We're on it! Montgomery, Harrisburg, Las Vegas! That's not a capital! What? I couldn't hear you. Las Vegas is not a capital of Nevada. I didn't say Las Vegas. What'd you say? Oh, just go! Go! Don't tell anyone. Okay. Nothing to get freaked out about. My arm's not stuck in a crevice, so I don't need to cut it off like that impatient idiot. (Screaming) I just cannot stop banging things down here. The acoustics are great. Tina, what song is this? "Aqua Boogie" by P-Funk? Yes! Wow. Hey. Hey, you. Tough guy! You want a piece of me? Sticky. Are you made of taffy? Huh. There you go. Not so scary, huh, Taff? Just you and me now... a girl and her taffy giant. Classic. (Echoing): Louise! Nice echo. When I say Gene, you say Gene. (Echoing): Gene! Gene! Linda: Gene? Ugh. Is that what my voice sounds like? Bob: Kids, where are you? We're down here. How did you find us? Bob: Because... we're your parents and we know everything. Did you read my diary? Yes. Linda: Are you okay? Where's Louise? I don't hear Louise. We don't know. She ditched us, and then she ditched us some more. It hurt even more the second time. Bob: Uh, did you take this elevator down? Yes, but then we broke it. Well, we'll just jump down to the top and figure it out from there. (Both groaning) We figured it out. (Sighs) You okay? How's your pen1s? It's okay. Mine's a nightmare, if anyone's wondering. (Strained grunting) Taff, you're not helping. Squishy b*st*rd. Is everyone around me useless? I have to do everything? (Chuckling): Okay, I see. Another Taff tantrum, right on schedule. Big news... Taff is upset! Everybody gather round! Sorry, Taff. I didn't mean it. You said things, I said things. Friends? ♪
♪ Linda (echoing): Louise! I can't believe you snuck out, and I... I still don't understand why you guys split up. She went to find the treasure by herself because we're "a burden." Gene, what did I tell you about finger quotes? Not to "do" them. But ironic detachment is great. Nothing means anything! Jimmy Jr.: Hey, up here! Who the hell is that? We went to get help. (Groans) I got more blood in my head than a skeeter on a peter. Oh, my God. You really do. All right, hang on a... I'll get you guys down. Jimmy, you're looking well. I've been fine. Okay, where's Louise? And that's why I ditched my brother and sister. Don't look at me with your judgmental, hollow eyeholes. What?! Gene and Tina were a liability. This is a treasure hunt! This is a professional operation! You would have left them, too. Well, you weren't there, were you? If they're so great, how come they haven't found me yet? Huh? Huh? Huh?! Gene and Tina: Louise! (gasps) Down here! (Stammers, groans) Don't, don't, don't, don't! No one likes an I-told-you-so. Oh, thank God. We'll get you out, baby! Are you all right, Louise? We're fine! Who's "we"? Me and Taff! Let's just call the fire department, right? There's no service. I hate this freaking phone, Bobby. Lin, we're underground. You can't blame the phone. What, do you work for the phone company now? Bob's Phone Company? What, are you going to beat me up? Get me out of here! Sorry, Louise. Yeah, sorry. I have a cheap phone, so you're going to have to stay in there for the rest of your life. Your mother was arguing about the phone. Yeah, I did a walk-through. I did it twice. We're good. Louise: Get me out of here! Okay. Louise, calm down. Listen, you're not in any danger. (Rumbling, rattling) What was that? Oh, no. No, no, no, no! Oh, my God. Maybe it's an earthquake. Maybe the neighbors are just moving furniture around. We should probably pray. Uh, dear God, this is Tina from school. I just peed Andy's pants. Warm, warm, warm, cold. (All screaming) Oh, crap. They started the demolition! Hey, so my friend had a three-bean salad party, but it was bring your own bean. Who does that? Don't worry, Louise! We're going to get you out! How are we going to get her out? Maybe we should smoke her out. Louise, are you sure there isn't something down there you can use to climb out? Louise: Oh, wait! Here's a grappling hook! Oh, and here's an escalator! Silly me! We're about to die, Louise. Do you really want your last words to be sarcastic? Louise (sarcastically): No! I got it... let's all spit in the pit. Then she can swim to safety. Right, J-Ju? (rumbling) We're all gonna die! Stupid book. I'm sick of acting like a dumb, helpless girl just so a hot boy who dances his feelings will notice me. That's not who I am. I'm a smart, strong, sensual woman. Bob: Oh, God. Now, here's how we'll get Louise out. We'll make a ladder. Everyone, lock your arms like this. The person underneath puts their legs through, and you use your core strength to do the work. Um, my core is super ticklish, so... I don't know, Tina. Tina: No, it'll work. I saw Jimmy Jr. and Zeke do it in wrestling practice. Hey, those practices are closed! I'm aware of that, Zeke. I'm the reason they're closed. (rumbling) All right, let's try it. Louise, grab Gene's hands. Can't reach them! Nobody say anything... Louise looks really different. What is that? This is Taff. He's a booby trap that became much more than that. (Rumbling) Everybody run! Why is Taff stuck on Dad? Well, sometimes, when a man loves a woman very much... Oh, crap. Dead end? Ugh. If I'm going to die, I'm going to play "Aqua Boogie" one last time. Hiyah! Gene, not now. Wait. That sounds hollow. Hit it again, Gene, harder. Daylight! Everybody, through here. (Sighs) We made it. We're safe. (cheering) Um, lots of people out here. Whoa. Your s*x night took a weird turn, huh, Bobby? (Groans) Daddy! Andy? Ollie? Hey, I thought you guys were with your mother. You came for us! I'm just here to watch the demolition. You know, I mean, yes, I came for you. I'm a great father. (Boys grunting) All right, off, off, off, off, off. You're wrinkling my belt. You know what, Tina? Strong girls are hot. Put it on a T-shirt, Jimmy Jr. I don't want to hear it. Just when I think I'm out, those cheeks pull me right back in. Get off me, you wuss. Ah, looks like you finally got the starch out of your shirt. Yeah. Finally. Aw, what a waste. Well, we'll try it next Sunday. Please don't drug me again. We'll see. Tina, Gene, Taff made me realize I was a little hard on you two. I said you were useless dead weight, but I was so wrong. Tina, you got me out of that booby trap. And Gene, you actually banged us to freedom. I can't take all the credit. I'd like to thank this brick and Questlove. I'm sorry I was mean to you guys. Eh, I just figured you were having female troubles. (Whispering): What are female troubles? I love you, too, Louise. Aw. And, Taff, what are the words? I love you. You're going to live with me now. You're not taking that filthy thing home. Yeah, you're right. Well, I guess there wasn't any treasure. This butt was just a joke after all. Maybe the journey was the treasure.

♪ Linda: So, Bobby, what are we gonna say to the bank manager tomorrow? If we don't get those loans restructured, we're up a creek. Screwed Creek. Don't worry, Lin. I got it all worked out. Very convincing stuff. Let's hear it. All right. Action! (clears throat) As you know, sir, we have several loans with your institution, all "past due." But what does "past due" even mean, you know? It's brilliant! There's no such thing as time. Gene was past due and he came out fine. I wish I stayed in there! Hey. Get out of there. Gene! Let me in! Let me back in! Gene! Bob! Oh, God. This is your son. Sorry, Gene. No backsies. You can't put the candy back in mom's wrapper. You know, I have a savings account at First Oceanside. So I might have some pull over there. Thanks, Teen, but I think I got this covered. No. Look, I know we owe money and my credit score's on the low side, but... It is the low side, Bob. It's kind of an inside joke around here. Hmm. (laughs): That's funny-- but I would still like you to look at the loan. No. Well, it's really important that... Bob, I have to take this call. That's... not a phone. Well I... I still have to take it. Great. Well, then I will, leave you your piece of paper phone call. I just wish that you... nope. You know what, forget it! Um... I'm gonna leave. Hey, thanks, man. Whoa! Get a car, idiot! Gonna check on my money. The bank manager didn't go for it. (sirens blaring) And he was mean. My God, Bobby, what'd you do? Nothing. I just punched a cardboard cutout guy. I didn't even punch it, I just flicked it. Oh, Bobby. Man, I got to do this stupid essay for English class on "someone important to me." I'd write about the guy who flies the helicopter on The Bachelor. Look at all those police! This is a good time for me to be stuck in that tree again. Linda: Kids! Get in here! Gene: Channel six news. They'll finger anything with a pulse. I'm pretty sure their slogan is, their "finger's on the pulse," Gene. No! That can't be right. It's right. Linda: Ooh, SWAT team's here. Intense. That guy's important. You can tell by the way he points. (muffled shouting) He' s fingering right at us! Bosco: Tell those guys to get behind the barricade, now! There's a hostage situation at the bank. We need this restaurant. (whispers): This is, um, interesting. The restaurant will get on TV. I know. I was just thinking the same thing. That's a lot of coffee's going out. Write it all down, all the coffees, we got to keep track. Officer (on radio): Snipers are in position on the roof. Oh, God, that's embarrassing. Our gutters are a mess. Hello. My name's Louise. I would like to donate a piece of my personal chalk in case you need to outline a body. Is my money safe in that bank? What are these kids doing here! U-Uh, they're our kids. They, uh, work-slash-live here. Well, keep them out of the way. You got me? Do I have a hard line yet? Line's up. (heavy breathing) Who's breathing on my line?! All I know is I was just talking to Ken, and now I'm on hold at the bank. Hey! Everyone shhhh! God, we're making the call. Shut up. This is Sergeant Bosco, and I'm in charge. Uh, who am I speaking with? All right, Mickey, how many people you got in there? Eight. Okay, Mickey, this is what we're gonna do: You... Uh-huh. He wants pizza. Oh, come on. They always want pizza. Isn't there an ltalian place across the street? Jimmy Pesto's? Heard that place was pretty good. Get six pizzas over there quick. No. That could've been huge for us. I hope this standoff ends... pizza-fully. (laughs) Pepper-ono-he-didn't! Ugh, you believe this? Pesto is getting the free advertising we were supposed to get. (mechanical whirring) How does, uh... one get into robot driving? (gasps) Did you go to robot college?! Come on, give me your keys, Seth. (slurring): I'm fine. I only have to drive .37 miles. We're in college, dude. Chillax. (retching) (panting) Are you sure you guys are naked?! Totally. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.... (Gasps) Oh! Ugh. I was just performing routine maintenance. Doesn't anyone knock around here? Jeez. There's no such thing as robot college. Not yet! (gunfire) Officer: Shots fired! Shots fired! (gasps) Finally, some g*n play. Down in front! Thank you. That was the worst pizza I ever had! Jimmy Pesto's is crap! (laughing): Yes! (groans) Ouch. Yeah. I'm sorry about the pizzas. Um, what do you want instead? Chinese? Burgers. Mexican? This is a burger place. Louise: What about Hot Pockets? Burgers are right here. Or nonfat frozen yogurt. We're in a restaurant. It's my restaurant. Ooh! How about some sort of a Malaysian cuisine? Burgers. How about, uh... burgers? Okay, burgers it is. Thank you. Uh, fries, do they want fries? All right, Mickey, listen up. You want fries? Yeah, he wants fries-- and a what? And a what? Here, you take the order! Oh, okay. Uh, Hi. Hi. So, uh... b-burgers. How about cheese? How many we doing with cheese? All right, who wants cheese? Huh, everyone. God, what do I want? Man (whispers): I don't want cheese. Woman (whispers): Just scrape it off. Um... be-be-bo, be-be-booo. What does Mickey want? Wh-What's your favorite? Well, the burger of the day is, the, uh, "Chard to a Crisp" burger. What the hell is that? Oh, it's, uh... uh, burger with Swiss chard on it. I was just having fun with it. Look at you, Mr. Creative. No... a little bit. What was your name again? Uh, Bob. Bob! What if you brought the burgers over yourself? Uh... (whispers): Say yes. Say yes, Bob. Say it. (whispers): Please, I can't do that. O-Okay. Mickey: (laughs) Okay, Bob's in. Who needs these scumbag cops, right? (nervous laugh): Scum... Right? Yeah. The cops are really... Scumbags! Yeah. Well, no. You can say it. Scrunched up faces and their stupid arms... I'm gonna start on those burgers, okay? Why do I need to wear this? 'Cause you might get popped. I'm ready to be the man of this family. I'm ready to call you dad, Gene. No one's calling Gene Dad. GeneDad! Time to go. Let's move. Remember, Bob, he's hot, you stay cool. Hot. Cool. What are you?! Um, th-the guy with the hamburgers. No, no, no. What are you, hot or cool? Cool... oh, cool. You're ready. Okay. Come here, come here, come here. Come back safe, Bobby.All right? Let's go, Bob. I love you, Father! I know. Bob, let's go. (kissing) Hold on one second... Bob. Yep. Dad, if you die, I'll have to write rort on GeneDad. Timing is everything here, Bob. Let's go. No, if you die, I'll write my report on you. Okay, enough, Bob. I'm coming. I just gotta finish up here. Let's go now! Well, my family's saying good-bye. This is a precision operation. Dad, don't go! Don't go! I've changed my mind! Don't go, I love you! Gene, you gotta let go of my arm. Dad, I love you. Please don't go! Please don't go! Oh, my God! Get off. I love you so much. I' be right there, I've just got to wrap this up. Shake 'em loose, Bob! Let's Go! I'm trying! They're not letting me go! I have too many unanswered questions! What is s*x?! Gene, just let go! I don't know what s*x is! I said, I'm coming! Bob! Come back safe, Bobby. Don't leave me with these friggin' kids. (sighs) Okay, I'm going. Oh, crap. We don't have the logos on our bags. That's what's gonna be on camera. I'm on it. Why'd you draw at? It's not a rocket. It's a fish. Okay. Why would you draw a fish? It's easy to draw. So is a hamburger, or my name. Looks like a Jesus fish. Preachy. Let's go. Now. Move it. It looks like a huge, misshapen pen1s. It's Bob's Burgers. It's supposed to be a fish, not a rocket, or a pen1s. It's a pen1s. (sighs) (sighing): Oh, boy. Bob: Oh...God. Bob (groaning): Oh... no. Bob: Oh, boy. Bob: Oh, my God. Bob? Yeah. Hey, you are Bob. You are definitely not a cop. Okay? Uh... thanks? Here are your burgers. Hey, w-what are they saying about me out there? Uh, that you'd be, um, hot. Hot? Like Vin Diesel hot? N-No, like hot-tempered. Like a hot guy with a bad temper... So, here's the burgers. (two gunshots) (screams) Bobby! How did you miss that?! Swat Sniper: Fatty got in the way. Uh, it's a code name we gave to Bob. You screwed up big-time sh**ting at me! Maybe I'll sh**t a hostage! Go ahead! Do it, big man! sh**t a hostage! You sh**t a hostage. Maybe I will! What is going on here?! You guys are trigger happy. No, we're not! (gunshot, screams, gasps) Are, too! What is wrong with you people? Stop this! Who is this? It's Bob. It's fatty. Look, Bob, we're gonna get everyone out of there safely, okay? I don't believe you! That was not on my orders. Someone just got a little hot. He's hot. We're cool. Remember? We're cool. We just sh**t sometimes. Okay, this is ridiculous. I'm coming outside now. Do not sh**t me! Whoa, whoa, whoa. If I let you go now, then everyone will want to leave. And it's a big domino effect thing. Bob's a hostage now. No. W-Wait, no. Hey, man, it's a really great group. Will you... close those blinds? Maybe we should pass those burgers around. My blood sugar is low. I dropped them. Hostages: What?! I was getting sh*t at. Speedo Guy: Drive through! That was gonna be my red meat for the week. What am I gonna do for protein? I've got a protein bar in my pocket. You can fish it out. (groans) I am so glad you joined the group, Bob. Oh, shut up, Frond. You guys know each other? What a coinky-dink. He works at my kids' school. We've had our... We hate each other. What? Oh, this is gonna be fun, you guys. He's taken Bob as a hostage. What?! This crazy! Yeah. Crazy good for my essay. Hello? Hello. You're on with Bob's youngest child, Louise. It's your daughter? Oh! They work with me at the restaurant. (sighs) Adorable. Yeah. Oh, no. You're such a good father. It's more about not paying regular--whatever. You want to talk to your Daddy? No. I want to talk to you. You have been selected as the subject of my important person school essay. Shut up. (laughs) Oh, don't tell me to shut up! Question one... What... It's my Daddy! Ah! How did you first get into bank robbing? Pfft. Me and a buddy of mine, we just kind of fell into it. You know, I had a g*n, I needed some money. All right, kiddo, we've had our fun now. Hand over the... It's my daddy! My daddy's in there! Yeah! Okay! So just a couple more questions. I know you're a busy guy. Give me the phone. Give me that phone back. Give it to me. You are being so rude right now. Ow! Ouch! Serves you right, kid. Listen to me, Mickey. We need to talk. No, no, no. You know what, I don't want to talk to you, I want to talk to the little girl. Negative. You'll talk with me. It's the girl or, you know, I sh**t somebody, I k*ll somebody. All right. Hang on. Hang on. (high voice): Hi, um... Listen, Mickey, you said you were a bank robber. Hey! I'm gonna sh**t somebody. Fine, here she is. This is Louise. I'm running the show now. Bobby! I'm worried about you. Who is this? Hey, it's Linda. Linda, hi. Who's this? This is Mickey. I'm a criminal. Hey, Nicky. How old are we? Don't worry about it. Ask about my money. Louise: Hey, Mickey, uh, my sister Tina's worried about her bank account. I have $87 in that bank. I heard 200. And I have just withdrawn her money for peace of mind, huh? Louise: Nice! I just brokered the release of my sister's money. You haven't brokered jack! All right, here's how we're gonna do this. (mechanical whirring) 

  Thank you! Hey, gimme that. No, no. I need that for evidence. I will punch you. And I will punch you! He will. I'm through playing games, Mickey! Uh, actually, it's Bob. Mickey wants me to handle the calls now. Oh. Bob... Yeah. All righisten, can Mickey hear this? No. He's... behind the counter, playing "banker." Oh, good, good, good. All right, now, listen very carefully. You are now my man on the inside. What? No. No, no. I'm just the guy who brought the burgers over, okay? No. Not anymore, Bob. You're more than a burger guy. (sighs) Now, listen, whatever you're doing at 6:00 pm, in exactly one hour, hit the deck. Hit the deck? What? Hit the deck. You've never heard that expression before? Yeah. I said "what"? Were you in the navy? No, I was not in the navy. Were you? Yeah. As a matter of fact, I was. But I don't want to go through my military history right now. "Hit the deck" means get down. Well, you don't have to be in the navy to know that expression. Just focus. Spread the word to the other hostages. At 6:00, on the dot, hit the deck. Wait, no. Listen, don't do that. Everything all right, Bob? Yeah, uh, no. Everything's fine, yeah. I just had a cramp. Oh, good. Then get over here and play banker. Come on, get in on this. Yay. You got a 50? Come on, I can break a 50. Um, I got a five. All right. Let's break Bob's five. One, two, three, four, five. We broke your five! Thank you. That was fun. You got five singles now. Olsen Benner here reporting from the hostage standoff, where tensions are high. I understand your husband is one of the hostages inside the bank. Yes. Bobby, if you're listening, we love you, baby. If you make it out of there, I will do anything, anything you want. Except that one thing. Us, too, Bobby. Anything. Most things, Bobby. All right, Mickey, you-you have to give up. You-you have to end this before someone gets hurt. I have a plan, Bob, okay? This is gonna go fine. I can help. I am a self-certified counselor, after all. You want money, okay. The cops want to k*ll you, sure. You have a g*n and might k*ll us. (sobbing) I am freaking out! What is your plan?! All right, I don't have a plan, okay?! This is the first bank I've ever robbed by myself, without Rodney. Oh, truth comes out. Rodney was the brains and you were the dead weight, I'm guessing. Why the hell would you do a job without Rodney?! You stupid idiot! Mr. Frond, shut up. He's right, I'm so stupid. No. I'm nothing without Rodney. Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid. Okay. All right, come here, come here. Sit down. (phone ringing) Hello? Dad, I need to talk to Mickey. It's an emergency; my report's due on Monday. Louise, please. I'm in a hostage situation. People could die. Ugh, I just want to know what the nuttiest thing he ever stole is? Bob, this is Linda. I don't know if you saw what I said to you on TV... What did you say? Anything. That's what I'll do for you if you get out. Everything's on the table, including on the table. Lin, Lin, stop. I have to go. Dad, I just remembered, I have an account there, too, and a safety deposit box. So I have about, I think a thousand, and then I just have, like, a lot of valuables in the safety deposit box. I'm sending the robot. How many extensions do you people have?! Four. All right, I'm hanging up. Mickey, listen, we-we got to start making moves here, okay? What if-- hear me out-- what if you release all the hostages... Ah. Yeah. No. You leave the money. Sure. Sure. No. You give yourself up. Why not? Why would I do that? Almost as good as your "what is past due?" argument. Look, I want to talk to Rodney. Man: Rodney, phone's for you! Hello? Rodney? Mickey! Hey, what's up? Oh, not much. (whispering): Uh, I botched a job, man. The cops are everywhere. What do I do? Are there cops on the phone? Yeah, but I'm whispering. Yeah, we can't hear anything. Go ahead. See? Oh, man. Rodney. Who the hell is that? Oh, just a little girl who's writing a paper about me. When you two were working together, what was the first thing you would buy after you stole all that money? You know, I love me a Cadbury egg, but I... That's my Rodney. Hey, Mickey, I don't know what you're up to, but count me out. Rodney! Rodney! Rodney! Easy, Mickey, calm down. Ah! Let me out of here! Women and children should be released. You're not a woman, Frond. I will tuck my junk so fast. Look, I'm losing it, Bob. Maybe I should make a break for it. Mickey, look, you're not getting away with the money. You have to accept that. I-I just don't think Rodney would... You got to stop thinking about Rodney, all right? You robbed this bank. So you need to decide how this ends, not how Rodney would do it. It's how Mickey would do it. Do the Mickey plan. I don't know what the Mickey plan is though. I just don't want to look like a total failure on TV. Cops touching my hair, laughing at me, pulling on me, grabbing m-m-my new jeans. All right, all right. So give yourself up, but on your r term. Look, I don't make a lot of money selling burgers, Mm-mm. but I do it on my terms. Mm, okay. All right, I'll turn myself in. On my terms. And here's one of my terms. I'm hungry! I want one of your burgers, Bob. Baby steps, baby steps, baby steps. Olsen: That's right, the hostage situation is moving to Fish Rocket Burgers. Say we go to your place, order up some burgers, I give myself up, on my terms. How you like my plan, Bob? Uh, it's not great. Pretty sweet? Uh, I think it's fair at best, Mickey, but it's yours. It sure is mine. Hey, what are you guys doing after this? I mean, not that I can come. Probably not. I mean, maybe I can. Hey, you guys are shoe twins! Look at your shoes. Easy. You're almost home, Bobby! Oh, God, now I have to do that. Bobby, I'll trade you that for two of the other things. Hey, hey, look at that. That's my ride. Gets great ass mileage. How are you still single? (whispers): I'm not. Oops. Hey! All right, we're out of the restaurant. I just don't get why we have to be in a huddle, too. So you don't fan out. Plus, we're in a huddle, and it just feels like it should be, you know, like a huddle thing. Pretty tight though. Looking good. Hey, I see you! Get in the bank or, you know, I start sh**ting! Ah! Okay, okay! We're going. See that? Yeah, this is how you go out in style. The Mickey way. Mickey! What advice would you give young people? Who's your hero? What's your favorite pig-out food? Stay in school, Superman, potato chips if I'm sad, chocolate if I'm bad. Louise, get out! You guys are amazing. Best human shields ever. Whoa, look out! Just kidding. Oh, my God, no, look out! I'm kidding. These burgers are good. This is great, huh? Look at me. Burger in one hand, beer in the other-- living life. This is how you go to jail. Yeah, and no one got hurt. Well, that, too. That, too. Hey, Bob, you know when they, uh, caught up to Rodney, they tackled him, and his pants came halfway down. He's splayed out like that, with his hands on his head, ass in the breeze. It's like his pants just kind of gave up. My pants are staying on. So thanks for that, Bob. Thanks for everything. Uh, sure, Mickey. (timer beeping) (coughing) The cops tear-gassed themselves. Love it! Oh, well done. That's the money sh*t. Goodie. (coughing) (retching) Ow, man, not my Sex-U-V! All right, now's my chance. N-No, Mickey, don't do it. Sorry to eat and run. Was that a cool line? Mm, not really. (slow motion): No...! (slow motion): Yes...! Run, Mickey! Not the pants...! (grunts) You see that, Bob? My pants are up! Ow! They're up! Yeah, I see, buddy. I see it. Dad! You survived! I did. Oh, Bobby, you're a hero. I don't know about that. You really stepped up today. Maybe I was wrong about you, Bob. Come by the bank tomorrow and we'll see about restructuring your loans. What the...? That's a dye pack from the bank. Uh, Mickey must have put it... Tsk-tsk-tsk... Oh, don't tsk me. I didn't... Mm-mm. Oh, come... Nope. Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. Didn't know you had it in you, Dad. I didn't steal the money. I believe you, honey. Kinda. Hey, Bob, why don't you go negotiate the release of some tomatoes from the walk-in? It's been two weeks, Lin. You can stop with the hostage jokes. (chuckles) (phone ringing) Bob's Burgers. Bob! It's Mickey! Hey, Mickey, how-how's jail? It's horrible. Ask him if he got the books on tape we sent him. Does anyone there need a pen pal? Ask him what he'll do for a pack of smokes. Hey, Bob, I wanted to know what grade your daughter got on that essay about me? Oh. Um, he wants to know what grade you got on that essay you wrote. Oh. I never even turned it in. Right. Uh, she got an A. Hey, we got an A! (inmates cheering)
Feel your uterus curl into a smile as you stretch deeper into Crowning Otter. (Grunting) Ugh, Crowning Otter... it's so graphic. Lin, why do you do this prenatal yoga? You're... I mean, you're not pregnant. Your youngest child is nine. I like it. It keeps my pelvic floor perky. Ah! (Cracks) Ugh. Ugh. Hey, Mom, when you're done polishing your pelvic floor, can you check my math homework for me? There's nothing on here but a drawing of a robot. Who's better at math than a robot? They're made of math. Oh, Mom, did you have a chance to finish reading Buddy's Rainbow? (sighs) I did. The ending was so sad. Ah, this... remind me how it ends. Buddy dies, poor doggie. Write it down. Write it down. At least he saw the rainbow. Oh, he did? Yeah. Louise, did you read any of the book yourself? I could read it, but I retain it better when Mom tells it to me. Lin, we've talked about this a thousand times. You can't keep doing the kids' homework for them. I'm not. I'm helping them. What about you, Tina? Is your mother helping you do your homework? No. See? But Mom's been logging her dreams in my dream journal for English class. Great, you're dreaming for her. Oh, last night, I dreamt I was breast-feeding Gene again, and he had a long white beard like Santa Claus. Oh, it was freaky. (Gasps) That could be our next Christmas card. Well, Teddy, I finally did it. I got a soft serve machine. I knew you could do it, Bob. You just need to believe in yourself. Yeah, and summer's coming. This thing is going to be a gold mine. ♪ ♪ Teddy: Bobby, where'd you go? Huh? Stop daydreaming. Let's have some of that ice cream. Okay, here we go. First bowl of a new era. Oh, ugh, nasty. Give it here, give it here, give it here. Don't throw it out. No, no, I wouldn't eat that. Just give it to me. It's not ready yet. Give it to me. (slurps) Ho-oh-oh. Wow, that is something there. As your first customer, I can tell you, you don't change a thing, you know. Teddy, you'll eat anything. What? I won't eat anything. I'm pretty discerning. Eat this. What was that? Don't feed a guy a sponge, Bobby. Don't feed a guy a sponge. You put it in your mouth, Teddy. (Groans) Louise, guess which one of us ate cat food. (Andy and Ollie exhale) Ugh, both of you. We brought it from home. See you in P.E. class. (Groans) I'm sick of P.E. So am I. Me, too. I hate the whole shirts and skins thing. I'm not open! I'm not open! I hate Ms. Schroeder's dumb rules. I told you, Louise, no hats in P.E. And I told you, I have a raging staph infection under here. Touch this hat and we all go down. You want to play dodgeball in the hospital? I hate how I always get hit in the head with the ball. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. I don't want to go to P.E. anymore. Both: Me, neither. Let's swing by Mr. Frond's office. He's highly suggestible. You guys, when I'm in P.E. class, I feel like I'm not living up to society's warped image of fitness. I feel like a loser. I feel like I'm not being valued as a woman. Me, neither. I need guidance and counseling. I'm a guidance counselor. Come in. So you're feeling a little P.O.'d about P.E., huh? (Chuckles) But physical education is a state requirement. I can't just let you out of it. But, what if, I don't know, instead of class, we did an independent... study in something sort of physical, something, like, I don't know, that the school doesn't offer. Independent study... I like the sound of that. Sounds like something I'd come up with. You just did. Yeah. You did. Nailed it. Uh, I guess I did. The superintendent is going to love this idea. So, what would you do for your independent study? Uh, swimming? Synchronized swimming. No, she doesn't mean what she says ever. Or just regular swimming and splashing. I love synchronized swimming. Who doesn't, huh? Yeah. I mean, okay, yeah. Great. All right, so, uh... you'll need an adult to supervise you. We know an adult. We definitely know an adult. Have 'em sign this. Louise: Linda Belcher... fancy on the "B"... definitely signed this form. Tina, synchronized swimming? That is the most random sport in the world. How'd you even come up with that? Mom loves synchronized swimming. Don't you remember during the last Olympics? She made us do everything synchronized. And brush and brush and brush and spit. Good. We just got out of P.E. for the rest of the year, my friends. Yeah, who needs it? (Straining) Phew. Here, let me try. Huh. I need to exercise. First, you fill the base of the cone. Boring. Just let me do the demonstration, all right? So the ice cream goes on the inside of the cone always? It goes... yes. It's like an edible bowl. We get it. Move on. Wait, if that's ice cream, why is it soft? Oh, my God. I have a question. Why are you telling us this? Because I'm going to need your help. You guys are going to be running this thing. Oh. I now pronounce you Team Soft Serve. I made a soft serve this morning, so I should be captain. Linda: Kids, time for school. Here, I washed your gym clothes. We don't need gym clothes anymore. Tina, of course we do. What, are we going to run laps naked? (Both laugh) (chuckles) Oh, and Gene, here's your Navajo warrior mask for your history class. Wow, Mom, great job. (Sniffs) It smells like you. I've been wearing it all morning. I love it. (Breathing heavily) Thanks, Mom. I hope we get a good grade. (Door opens, bell jingles) Hmm, uh-uh-uh. Don't you make noises at me, you judge-a-roo. Go play your judge-eridoo. Uh-uh. Ah-ah! Louise (chuckles): Suckers. Louise, why aren't you in P.E.? Do you guys have lice? I do. I do. For your information, we don't do P.E. anymore. We do independent study, thank you. Yeah, we're off the grid. So long, balls. Boy: Heads up! Ow. Ow. ♪ Headin' out of P.E. ♪

♪ Now we're in a nail salon... ♪
♪ On. ♪ Mr. Frond, pretty yarn. Do you knit? You tell me. (Chuckles) What up, my knitta? So, let's talk synchronized swimming. Oh, yeah, I'm always up for that. Big commitment. I bet. I still have the '96 Olympics on VHS. The Miracle on Melted lce. Ooh, I have Dynasty on VHS. Well, I can't wait to see the routine you choreograph for the kids in independent study. Independent wha...?! Those little sneaks. I can't believe they lied to Mr. Frond like that. Ah, here you go, sir. And they used me in their lie. What do you expect? You coddle them too much. Well, I'm not going to coddle them this time. I'm going to get real tough. Louise (sighs): What a day at school. I feel so physically educated. Hello, kids. I had a very interesting encounter with Mr. Frond today. You did? Yeah, he's an interesting guy. Yeah, he is very interesting, Tina. He's so interesting that he told me about your independent study. Uh... I got to go. I have forgot everything outside. Sit down. I got big, big news for you. You're not going to get away with it, either. Dad, do you want some help with the soft serve? Get over here. Look at this face and remember it because it's the face of your new synchronized swimming coach. (All gasp) What? Lin. Huh...? I guess we actually have to do synchronized swimming now. Tina, this is the woman who chewed your food for you when you had your tonsils out. We're not going to have to lift a finger. Okay, you two, lift your fingers. Synchronized swimming starts at your fingertips and ends with your tippy toes. I like it! It holds things in, in all the right places. Why is Gene wearing a girl's suit? 'Cause, otherwise, we wouldn't look synchronized. All right, everyone in the pool. Come on. (Both blow whistle) Whistles are for lifeguards only. Sorry. Thank you. Mom... I mean, uh, Coach, before we dive in, maybe we could watch you do a few moves. We're visual learners, right, guys? Yeah, like Jennifer Beals in Flashdance. She had to watch a lot of welding before she got good. I love Flashdance. Okay, I see your point. This is called the eggbeater kick. Nang-nang-nang-nang-nang-nang- nang-nang-nang-nang-nang-nang... Looking good, Mom! I'm learning a lot from looking! See, not so bad. I could get used to this. Hi. Hello. How are you? I'm fine. How are you? I'm good... not drowning. That could change. Please don't lean on the... Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you. Be right with you. Here's your ice cream, Teddy. Bob, this is too cold. Can you just put it in the microwave for me? I can't do that right now, Teddy. It's too cold. I can't eat it. Just eat it as is! I can't eat this. Oh, my God. Just warm it up for me. Teddy, you're k*ll*ing me. Come on, take a second. Give me the ice cream. Give it to me. Don't put it on too long, now. Excuse me. Can I get a sample of the chocolate? Why do you need a sample? You don't need a sample. But how will I know what it tastes like? It's chocolate... it tastes like chocolate tastes. Is it nonfat? Um, no. What percentage of fat is it? I don't know. Is it two percent? I don't know. You should get it melted. Can we get a sample of the melted? You won't be sorry. Teddy. What? Stop. Uh, Bob... I think my medium rare burger is turning into a well done situation. Oh, crap. Bobby, take it out of the microwave. Bobby, take it out of the microwave. I'm cooking now, Teddy. Bobby, take the ice cream out of the microwave. We're back. Lin, you can't keep the kids this late. I need you guys to be here. Here, Teddy, there's your bowl of melted ice cream. Oh, the bowl is hot. I can't do burgers and ice cream by myself. Dad's freaking out. I'm not freaking out! Totally freaking out. Shut up! Okay, shh, shh, shh, shh. I'm gonna go change. Me, too. I'm not. How was swim practice, Lin? Good... the kids will be ready to get in the water any day now. They haven't gotten in the water yet? They're visual learners, Bob. It's a scam, Linda. They're not playing a sport. They're playing you again. Look, soft serve. Oh, God. All right, here's a sample. I want vanilla. Do you have strawberry? Swirl it. Swirl it. Look, we don't do swirls or sprinkles or strawberry. Swirl it. This is not low fat! Oh, my God. Just spit it out. Spit it. Spit it. You're my best friend. You're my best friend. All right. All the teenagers leave! Little Leaguers, too! I ate some of that sponge. I want a sponge. Out! (Grunts) Gene, boogers. (Snorts) That is good stuff. Uncut. Kids, down here! Time to work on scissor kicks. Today, we're going to actually do them in the water. Gene just ate, Mom. We could get a cramp. What are you guys doing here? Mr. Frond made us independent study kids, too. Whee! We could use more people for a pyramid lift. Or we could make a circle. (Gasps) Concentric circles. ♪ ♪ (gasps) Ooh. Hey, Linda, I like the choreography. You're a great coach... a beautiful, sensual coach. (Gasps) Thank you, Tom Selleck. (Kids laughing) Kids, stop! Stop! Stop! Whoo-hoo! Yeah! Marco. Wahlberg. (blows whistle) No whistles. You know that. I know the whistle rule! Fine. Please don't lean on the chair. What's wrong with you kids? Don't you care about your independent study? No. Louise said this class was a joke. Yeah. Say something funny. Louise, Tina, Gene, get over here now. Ah... good one. Cannonball! That is it! Your father was right. You're just taking advantage of me. You and Dad were talking about us behind our backs? Not cool! If you don't care about your P.E. requirement, then I don't, either. I quit! Looks like somebody's ready to coach independent drama. Where are you guys going? The pool's that way. Screw the pool. Without our mom around, we make the rules again. Oh! Am I glad I caught you guys. I have very exciting news. I pulled some strings, left several persuasive voice mails. The upshot: The superintendent is bringing the school board to the pool this afternoon to watch you synchronized-swim. What?! But our mom quit. Ow. They even suggested doing a graded performance. We're going to set up a judges' table. It'll be like the Olympics. Mr. Frond... ha!... we should not do this. The whole point of independent study was so that we wouldn't feel judged. You're judged from the day you're born till the day you die. The school board wants to see you do scissor kicks and perfect lifts. Otherwise, you're all going to summer school. Summer school? (Screams) What am I going to wear? I'm glad you finally quit helping the kids, Lin. It was the right thing to do. You were right, Bob. I needed to let my baby birds fly... my bratty little baby birds fly with their crappy little wings. That was... Sometimes you just got to push 'em out the window. Yeah. You just got to push 'em right out there. And if they fall flat, then that's them. Well, you know what, it's nice to have you back. It's nice to be back. Hey, you want to train me on this thing or what? You bet I do. All right. Yeah, you put your... Okay. ... put your hand on the knob. Yeah? Like that? There you go. Yeah, no. Like that? Slow. Slow.

  Oh, hey, Tom Selleck. (Linda babbling) Uh, Linda, take it easy. Oh! Oh! Whoo. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Yeah, you can't pull it down that hard. Okay. Mom, we're really sorry. Will you come back and help us right now, please? Hmm. Stay strong, Lin. All: Please. I accept your apology, and I will help you. What? Great! Let's go. I will help you by not helping you. Right? Mmm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. What just happened here? Why is everyone smiling and not helping? Mom, Mr. Frond is making us perform for the school board this afternoon. Not my problem. Exactly. Not her problem. It's not my problem. Yes, what she said. Not mine. Okay, let's not... And if we don't pass, we have to go to summer school. Summer school? Yeah. What next? Summer church? Summer dentist? Summer visit Grandma? Summer camp? Wait, I'd go there. You guys made your bed, and now you're going to have to swim in it. Whoa, whoa. Lin, the kids can't go to summer school. We need them here in the restaurant. I thought you said quitting was the right thing to do. We both said a lot of things. Just, you help them. I will not, you hypocrite. If you want to help the kids... you're such a know-it-all parent... then help them yourself. I'm done. Yeah! Dad, help us! Yeah! Help us, Dad! Please. That's a great idea! No, no, no. What? No, not me. Yeah. Yes, you. No, I'm busy. Dad. Hmm? Summer School. And you're here all alone without Team Soft Serve. It's too cold. I can't eat it. What percentage of fat is it? Swirl it. Is it nonfat? Take it out of the microwave. Uh, Bob. Swirl it. The bowl is hot. Totally freaking out. Swirl it. No! (Sighs) Okay, fine. I guess I'll have to figure out some kind of routine. I taught you kids how to use this, right? Yeah. But I still don't understand where the ice cream goes. All right, shut up. Forget it. Superintendent Douglas, let me get your chair for you. I got it. I got it. Yeah. Ah. Once upon a time, there was no such thing as math. Until one brave teacher said, "Hey, what about math?" I think independent study synchronized swimming will be the next math. We are so screwed. We're all gonna die! Let's die like we were born... two minutes apart! All right, everybody, calm down. Huddle up. Come here. We can fake our way through this. We'll do a few of these and some of this. And maybe we'll be okay. Dad, go change into your suit. I'm in my suit. Hmm? This is what men wear, Gene, in the pool. Well, it looks ridiculous. ♪

So, will you help me? Sure, step aside. No, no, no. I gotta do it myself. I don't know, man. Your technique's sloppy and your stance... why are you standing way back? You got to press your wiener against the game, like this. See? Yeah. Okay, all right. Wow. Oh. Yeah. Wow. I'll teach you, if you beat up Tyler. How old is Tyler? He's 12. Well, uh, we'll see. Okay. I can't really shake, 'cause my... You want to just maybe E.T. it? God, I almost want to beat you up. Kevin: This isn't a bar mitzvah! I'm not Jewish! Kids: ♪ Hava nagila, hava nagila... ♪ Ahoy, there, mateys! So... what knots did you learn? Knots Landing? (laughs) Oh, my God. They learned a ton of knots, right? Mmm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Uh, absolutely. Tina: Yeah. A lot. Like what? Uh... the fish noose. Yeah. Linda: Ohh. The walrus's surprise. The... cake and ice cream. Ooh! That one sounds complicated! When do I get to go sailing with you guys? Oh, uh, soon, Lin, soon. Ooh! I can't wait! I'm gonna start putting my hair up in a ponytail. Why not pigtails, Mom? Twice as classy. I'd go with a flat-top... but, hey, it's your head! Time to take my awesome pills. Am I glowing? I feel like I'm glowing, Darryl. (Echoing): Hi, Bob. Oh hey, Burgerboss! (Echoing): Lookin' good. (Chuckles) Thanks. Are you high? No. You kidding? A little bit. Yes. Video games and drugs... those two things don't mix. Shut up. You're not too zonked to beat up Tyler, are you? No. Who's Tyler? Who's Tyler? Tyler's my bully! He could show up at any time! Come on, Bob, focus! Right, right, right, right. Let me just take one more pill. Happy Birthday, Samantha and Margaret! Our names are Jennifer and Kyrsten! We're always mixing you two up. Hey, Dad, get in on this pizza! No pizza! He's in training. Hope you get your lost manhood back, Dad. Take good care of our father, strange nerd! No funny business. I'm not a nerd! I'm a video game enthusiast. ('80's style rock song beings) ♪ Close to the top! ♪ See that?

Hi, I'm here for the orphan benefit, Tots Without Yachts? I'm the orphan. I'm Whit Worthington's ward, Wayne. I'm here to change the lightbulb in the lighthouse. Wait. What? We're gonna breeze right past you now. Thank you. Gene: Mm-hmm-hmm. (Indistinct conversation, laughter) Wow. It must be yacht prom. This is the Commodore's Ball. You know what? Just give me the tray. And make some mini pizza bagels. Thank you. This is for you. For your effort. There are more of these tickets where that came from. So keep this guy happy. Ow! Time to reload. This goes in here. And this goes in here. Oh, my God, oh, my God... Tyler's here. This is not a drill. Tyler? My bully! W... Wait... What're you doing? What're... Don't. This will make you look tough. And this will make you feel tough. Hey, Darryl, I don't have a lot of shirts, so don't do that. Oh. I thought your arms would look bigger. Let's put these back on. Oh, lookie what time it is. Punch-thirty. Nice one, Ty. Say something tough. Say something like "punch-thirty," then attack them all. Uh, hey, guys, listen, all right? I'm an adult. And it's, uh, it's gonna get kind of heavy here. Hold on, I forgot the bicep band. Okay, punch his face! What the hell, man? I'm not punching any faces, okay? I'm gonna talk to the faces. What are you doing, Bob? Kick his ass! I got it, Darryl. Look, I know you, right? You're Tyler. And you have fun beating up Darryl, here, all right. But Darryl, he doesn't like it. And let's be honest, there's a race thing going on here. Darryl, you're something... right? Black? That is not the issue. I beat him up 'cause he's a nerd. All right, I got an idea. Hold on, I'm just gonna take a pill. Mmm. Darryl, I want you to smile. No. That's good. And Tyler, I want you to also smile. No way. (Whispers): I'm so high. Okay, now, guys, just touch... touch your smiles together, okay? This is going really well. So now that we got that... (snoring) Bob? Bob? Bob?! Your bodyguard's asleep, wuss. (Grunts) Ow! That's for standing up for yourself. (Gasps) Chicken leg! Aah! What're you doing? Yeah, Bob! Unleash the beast! No mercy! Ah! Relish hole! Run! This guy's crazy! Fantastic. Not my problem. Thanks for coming to Family Funtime. Drive safe. (Humming) Bob: Chicken leg! (Thud) Ow! I fell down. Help! There's a crazy man chasing me! Yes! Tomato slice! Take that! (Screams, car alarm whoops) What do you think those are for? You get one for every octopus you k*ll. I'm taking one. Can I have that? I wish I'd met you sooner. I wonder what you looked like 15 minutes ago. Dad! Some hairy guy's trying to k*ll me! Burgerboss is gonna get you! Oof! Hi, Dad. Bacon-wrapped scallop? Sure. (Phone rings) Hello? Hi. Is this Mrs. Belcher? Yeah. Security Guard: I'm calling from Glencrest Yacht Club. Ooh! We need you to come down here right away. (Gasps) Okay! (Humming happily) Moisten the mizzenmast! What? You know what I mean! That thing. (kids grunting) The mizzenmast! All right! (Linda hums happily) ♪ Three-hour tour... ♪ You must be Linda Belcher. Yeah! How'd you know? Your family's in the trophy room. Follow me, please. Trophy room! (Slurping) (quietly): The mayor is here. Hi, Mayor! (Sighs) I'm glad you made it here so quickly, Mrs. Belcher. We need your help with... this. (Gasps) (grunts) Get away from me! What the hell's going on here? It's the Commodore's Balls. Your husband just barged in here. We caught your children stealing food and regatta pennants. And oyster forks. (Grunting) Princess Mayonnaise! We'll go back to back! Let's fight our way out! All right, someone better tell me what the hell's going on! Is this sailing class? Uh... Dad was using us to get into Family Funtime so he could get better at Burgerboss. Now he's in a k-hole. He tried to make me kiss another kid! You deserve it! Who are you people? Who the hell are you? I'm Tyler's father! And the president of this club. Ooh! Oh. Why didn't you tell me this was going on? We were kind of busy, partying our nuts off. Yeah, we were at Family Funtime. Partying our butts off. I said "nuts"! You know, I'm so disappointed. This whole time, I thought you were taking sailing lessons. (Crowd laughs, scoffs) Oh, shove it. Judge me. Jimmy: Ah, hello, Linda. You're a member here, Jimmy? Soon. Top of the wait list. I forget, uh, you guys members? (laughs) All of this is because you went and wrote "Bob Sux" on a video game. You. Aw, you're right, Lin. Let me see if I can help out, huh? Bob sucks! (Yelling) (laughs) Jimmy, you're just as pathetic as Bob with your peeing races. "Peeing races"? What are "peeing races"? That's not going to go over well with the membership committee. Sounds like a s*x thing. It does. But... (stammering) Aw, come on, guys! Come here, you! We're leaving, you pill-popping liar. Ow. Ow. Come on! Ow. Your mini pizza bagel, sir. I don't even want it anymore. Hold on. Yes, I do. Lin, I'm really sorry I lied to you. And did drugs. And used your children. Use it or lose it, right, Dad? You know what, Bobby? At the end of the day, it's for the best. Can you imagine being on a boat with those people? Yeah. I mean, if we were gonna have to be banned for life from someplace, I'm glad it's there. Yeah, the caviar was too salty. Well, technically, caviar is salty, Gene. Yeah, but I think they salted it on top of that. They're idiots. (door bells jingle) Oh, hey, Darryl. Hey, Bob. So you're the video game coach? And you must be Bob's wife. She does have big boobies. (Chuckles) What?! Yeah, okay. (laughs) I might have said that when I was high. Well, I came by to thank you. 'Cause of you, I'm not gonna let Tyler bother me anymore. Really?! I decided I don't want to be like you, a 60-year-old man, still battling his bully. (Clears throat) Okay. Uh, I'm not 60, by the way. But, uh, I'm glad I could help. And you know something, I'm all right with Burgerboss having "Bob Sux" on the leaderboard. Aw, I'm proud of you, Bobby. Yeah. Mm. Come here. (Quietly): Hey, you're gonna knock "Bob Sux" off the leaderboard, right? I'm on it. Good. Just change it to "Fat Bob." "Dumb Bob" works too. Or "Hi, Bob!"
I got a visual lock on sandwiches. Where? One o'clock. 1:00? But I'm hungry now! Tina: Are they ice cream, or regular? Louise: Both. Gene and Tina: Whoa. Keep it in your pants, guys. Psst. Here comes your father. Nice try. I saw you looking. Mom says it's okay to look. Yeah, we're married, not buried! Look, I know you kids are excited about the food trucks that are stealing our business and bankrupting us. I'm excited. What's so great about getting food from a truck? There's no sitting area. There's no bathroom. There's long lines. Who eats like that? Animals eat like that. I don't know, Bob, I think it's nice. It's like camping. Except without all that awful nature. It's just a trend, Lin, and anyway, say good-bye to the trucks, kids. Because tomorrow we are taking back the street. And taking back the night! Respect for women! My body, my rules! (Western music plays, a hawk screeches) Okay, we're gonna block all the spots in front of the restaurant. You ready? Go! (Gasps) (groans) Go away! This street's haunted. Bobby, they're everywhere. We're outnumbered. I told you we should've had more children! (Grunting): I'm just gonna let you tire yourself out. Gene, stop. This was a terrible idea. Plan B, Dad! I'm slashing tires! No! Then they'll never leave. I'll poison the tires. It's the documentarian who hates Dad and puts wigs on cows. Werner Herzog? Oh, hello, Bob! I forgot you lived-slash-worked here. Well, I do. And you're blocking my restaurant with your ridiculous food truck. Ode to Soy? I'm soy excited that you like it. I don't. What are you doing here? Are you making another documentary? No. Filmmaking was just a hobbytunity for me. And now you own a food truck? How can you afford this? Hmm... I have my ways, Bob. One of those ways is that I have inheritance from my grandfather. You'll be able to read all about my food trucking journey in my blook. What's a "blook"? A blonde cook. Blooks have more fun. No. It's a blog I'm writing that I'm turning into a book. And then probably a bloovie. You-you can't take two words and make them into one stupider word, Randy. Well, Bob, now you're not invited to the blemiere. Aww. Well, good luck with your terrible vegan food. Oh, thanks, Bob. Good luck with your terrible life. Good luck with your stupid walk. I hate the way you walk. Oh, good luck with wearing that face all over the world. Good luck with your ble... your blemishy face. My what? B... B... B-wha? Good luck with your speech therapy. See, this is what I mean... idiots in trucks selling food to idiots on the sidewalk. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I want it! Oh, Genghis Flan! I think I saw pizza straws! Oooh, Ain't Muffin To it! Yay! Se Bob? Look around... food trucks are the future. No, they're a trend. Yes, the trend of the future. Well, maybe I'll just get my own food truck, Randy, and park it right out front here. You should! Maybe I will! You seriously should! It's a good idea! Then if it's a good idea, I'm going to do it! Well, I hope that you do, because it is a good idea! Well, do you seriously think it's a good idea?! Yes, I do! That's what I'm trying to tell you! Well, then, I will do it! All right, I'm glad you took my advice! Well, I'm not mad at you anymore! I'm not mad at you in the first place! 'Cause if you think it's a good idea, I should get a food truck! Bob, I'm just mirroring your energy! Fine. I'm... my point is I'm a cook. I could do it. Right? Okay. Yes. I think it's a good idea. Thank you. What happened there? (Phone rings) Bob's Burgers. Bob (on phone): Lin, I did it. Did what? Bob: Look out in the street. I'm fighting back. Linda: I'm looking. I'm not seeing anything. You're scaring me. Bob: Just pull the cord and come to the window. What? Nothing's there. Bob: Okay, switch to the cordless. It broke. Bob: Eh... Never mind. Just come outside. Gotta go. Bob: What do you mean, you have to go? You don't have to say "gotta go," I'm on the phone with you. Oh. Bob: I said come outside. What do you mean, "gotta go"? I'm nerv... You're making me nervous. Bob: Just come outside. Gotta go. (Ice-cream truck music plays) Ta-dah! Ahhh. What is it? I bought a food truck. I'm gonna show 'em, Lin! I'm gonna show 'em all! (Engine sputters and dies) Don't, don't breathe that. (coughs) I'm sure it's fine. Bobby, you bought a food truck? How can we afford this? We can't. Really. I had to dip into Gene's college fund. Nah, I probably won't be needing it. But what about all that stuff you said about not giving in to trends? We're selling out! Yeah! Gene, we're not selling out. We're gonna steal customers from our own restaurant. We'll never see it coming. This truck needs a makeover. Makeover, ooh! We're gonna turn this whore into a Pretty Woman! Big mistake! Big! I love that part. When she does that. She goes in the store. Bob, you're not gonna close the restaurant, are you? Now that you're a hotshot food truck guy? I'm not a food truck guy, Teddy. Besides, I can't afford to close the restaurant. I'm just stealing my customers back. I... You don't have to steal me back. I never buy anything off a truck except stereos and stamps. Love that stamp truck. Tina (on walkie-talkie): Bob's one to Bob's two. Tina, use our code names! Tina: Oh, sorry. Black Beauty to Music Man and The Godfather. What's your 20? Over. We're in the wheelbarrow with Back-hair and The Jackal. I better be the Jackal. Dad. Grow up. Okay, I got the flat-top all installed here. Couple things to know. I rigged it so the grease'll drain into this trap. You don't open it while you're driving, or you'll coat the road behind you. Cars'll be slipping and sliding all over the place. Slippity-slide! It's not a joke. It's very serious. Ah, it sounds funny. Oh, one more thing; This is important. What was it? Oh, yeah, you can't have the truck and the grill going at once. Okay. What'll happen? Could be fine, could be a giant fireball. Hey, does this turn the grill on? Yes, it does, Gene. Gene, no! So, you want me to just start over here, Bob? (Sighs) Yup. Same invoice? Why not? Who else doesn't want to go to college? Me! Me! Louise: It's weird to look at the restaurant now. I can't believe I used to work there. This must be how the astronauts felt the first time they saw the Earth from space. So small. So fragile. This isn't so bad, right? It's tight quarters, but it's kind of cozy. If by "cozy," you mean it reeks. Yeah, why do your armpits smell like feet? And his feet smell like chili! 'Cause I don't wash. But do you season? Get up, Gene. Hi, I'm Tina. May I take your order? Sure, Dina. I'll have a... No. My name is, uh... Dina. Okay. That's what I said. Tina's on break. Dina's filling in... and I'm her. Kids, hold down the fort. I gotta drop a potato in the crockpot. Got it. Back-hair's deucin', over. Copy that. Wait. Where's everybody going? Oh, Bob, you're adorably naive. Food trucks go wherever hungry people are! Like super heroes. Like super heroes! Well, where is that, exactly? I'll never tell! Okay, the flea market and then the baseball game. Look, just... just follow me on Chowster. Adieu, Robert, adieu! Chowster? It's a site where we can post where the truck's gonna be every day, so people can follow us. You're gonna move the truck around? Can it even drive? Yes! I think. Downhill. I thought we were just gonna park out in front and steal our own customers. If you drive around, you'll be stealing someone else's. Yeah, well, we're not making enough money stealing from ourselves. Great. While you're in the party truck, I'll hold down the fort. The boring old fort with no wheels. Looks like we're adding "whine" to the menu. The road will be the perfect place for Dina. She's restless. (Grunts) Oh. (grunts) What should we call ourselves? We need a handle online. The Cat Burger-lers. Hmm, we're not an improv group. Beef curtains. Gene. Mm. You said I could say that once a year. Yes, on your birthday. @BobsBurgersFoodTruck is just fine. Yeah, if this was three years ago. Oh, you were serious. Beef curtains! ♪ ♪

  Yo-ho! Guys! Guess who closed the restaurant and came on the road? We're gonna be like the Partridge family, but with food. You closed the restaurant? Lin, we need to have both going at the same time. Fine, then you go work there. I don't want to. Good! So make room for Mommy in the fun-bus! Dad, drive. Hey, hey! Bob: Lin, come on. Gene and Louise: Okay, go. I'm not in! Don't go! Gene: Yes! Go, go, go. Louise: Drive! Where you going? Hey, my foot! I told you this would be fun. Hey! Bob: All right. Everybody out. Bedtime. In the house? I hate the house. Now that we're not doing the restaurant, the house feels kind of pointless. What do you want to do, sleep in the truck? I'll go get the sleeping bags. Yeah! And my moisturizing gloves! And Tina's body pillow! He has a name! Sorry, Jeffrey. A new name calls for a new look. And a new voice. Tina talks like this. (Same voice): Dina talks like this. Nice-sized line, Bob. You're almost getting the hang of this. Yeah, you know, it's fun. Too bad we're not making any profit. Between the repairs, the gas... Hey, Dad... and that, we are still in the red. Oh, well, if you want to actually make money on this, you've got to get on the festival circuit. First one of the season is this weekend. Lolla-PA-foods-a? Isn't it funny how much more I know than you? No. I think it's embarrassing. Anyway... Everyone gets drunk and spends lots of money. And this year Tabitha Johansson is headlining the concert. Tabitha who? (Scoffs): The sexy pianist. She sings that song about oil spills, but you know she's talking about her v*g1n*. Gene. How do you know that? It's not subtle. It really isn't. Plus, the most popular truck gets a cash prize: A thousand bucks. Wow, that sounds great. We could really use a thousand bucks. The festival circuit. Maybe we'll never come home! Why would you? Yeah. We can get truck-schooled! And have truck prom. Hey, you'd be friends with everyone in school! You would. Oh, yeah. All right. Everyone's got their seat belt on. (Snores) Linda: Ooh... Ooh! This thing is big and intimidating. I don't know if I should drive it... Hey, Jennifer Slow-pez! Get the hell out of the road! My God, Lin. What? What's gotten into you? I don't know. This truck just makes me feel so powerful. I think I'm okay now. Hey, Driving Miss Crazy, pick a lane! Hurry up! Hurry up! Lin, are you okay? You seem a little on edge. I'm hopped up on bennies, Bob. Don't tell the kids. What? Where'd you get those? They hooked me up at the truck stop. See? These are non-drowsy antihistamines. Well, whatever they are, they're doing the trick. (Groans) It's gonna take forever to get inside. No, it won't. No one's using this right-hand lane, I'll tell you that. Uh, Lin, I think this is the sidewalk. (Horn blares, man gasps) Use the crosswalk, you maniac! You're gonna get yourself k*lled! Okay, you guys are my street team. We need to make some money, and it wouldn't hurt to win "most popular truck." Gene, Louise you're gonna pass out samples. I wouldn't mind passing out samples. Dina's ready to mingle. Fine by me! Let the new girl do it. Fine, just be aggressive. Dina only plays offense. Gene, Louise, you write our Chowster updates. Make us sound cool. Okay. Should I just write negative stuff about the other trucks so that people will come to ours? No, You should not do that. Okay, I definitely won't. Free samples. Bob's Burgers. Hey, cool glasses. Thanks. I need them to see. Ha! Is this organic? Sure. Is it grass-fed? Yes. Cruelty-free? Is it bison? That one is. Do these pair well with an IPA? It goes well with all letters. IPA, CSI, PTA, IRS, HMO, OMG. Where are you selling these? Uh, right over there. And that's how Dina plays the game. Man: Oh, yeah, totally. The definition of free-range, you know? Let's start with the dumpling stand. (Eating loudly) Okay, how was it? Mm, I wouldn't kick it out of bed for eating crackers. It tastes like they actually went to the dump to get this dumpling. That's not what I said. (munching) Woof! Someone put a leash on this quiche! (Munching) Let's not get this party tarted! (Chuckles, munching) These crepes gave me cramps! Hey, guys, what have you been doing? Lying on Chowster. You? Lying to hipsters. I'm lying to myself. I do not look good in shorts. (Crowd murmung) Wow, this is going great, huh, Lin?

Hello, everybody, it's Paul Blinkman. How we doing out there? What the hell, @BobsBurgersFoodTruck? "More like Boo-ritos"?! Trying to spread rumors, huh? You ruined my business today. "Samosas on a Stick will make your butt sick"? Wait. What? Wow, Dad, I didn't know you were such a mean girl. He's a nasty b1tch. Oh, Louise, you didn't. Okay, it's the moment you've all been waiting for. What an amazing competition this year, and we have a winner... it's a new truck... Bob's Burgers! (laughs) Hey, Bobby! Bob's Burgers! We won! Sorry, gotta go. Whoo! Boo! Boo! Boo! (Crowd booing) Come on. Don't boo. Look, I'm sorry my daughter wrote mean things about you and that we knocked off some of your mirrors. You're the one who knocked off my mirror? Boo! You're not even creative. You just make hamburgers. You're the worst! You're the worst! Oh, yeah? Well, guess what. We won! We schooled you! I liked his burgers. And they're grass-fed, cruelty-free soy-bison. Soy bison? No they're not. That's what Dina said. Uh... You lied to us! This is fraud! Freak! Liar! This is fraud! Dina, what have you done? Let's get him! My dad can take all of you, you weak hippies! Gene! Okay, maybe just the drunk guy who barfed on his baby. (laughs woozily) I'm gonna throw a falafel at him! There! Ooh, this crowd has energy! Uh-o. Bob, kids, get back in the truck. Tabitha: ♪ Ener-g-gy! ♪ I'm just going to, uh... go! Tabitha: Energ-g-gy! Oh! Oh, Dina, you are more trouble than you're worth. So long, Dina. Uh, everybody, stop. Let me... Wait! Stop! If you want to get to Bob, you're gonna have to go through me first. Let's get both of 'em! (Crowd clamoring) Here he is! Bob, Bob, let me in. What? You just turned against me, Randy. Please, Bob. I'm not strong. (Sighs) Fine. Whew, that was close, but we're safe now. There's nothing they can do to us in here. (Screaming) (banging) Is everybody okay? I'm okay. Kids? I can't feel my legs. (farts) Oh, never mind, it's just gas. Hey, Dad, the truck's upside down. I know, Tina. Okay. These foodies are showing some spine, and I like it! Again! Oh, God, we're gonna die! If I survive you, Bobby, I won't get remarried... for two years. I don't want to die a virgin. Me neither. Wait, that gives me an idea. No, no. I never should have given in to this stupid food truck fad. I miss the restaurant. Me, too. What is going on out there!? This was just supposed to be a food festival. Louise: Holy crap. Burn, you beautiful bench, burn! Burn, you beautiful bench, burn! It's nuts out there. I give 'em an hour till they're eating each other. I hope you're happy with yourselves. Look what your Chowster bullying did! Our bullying got us a thousand-dollar check! What about Tina's lies? It wasn't me, it was Dina. It's not a lie if you lie to vegetarians. You taught us that. I-I did teach you that. What about your road rage, Mom?! Yeah! What about it? It's not very good. Can we agree that Randy is blameless here? No. No. Whoa! Almost blameless? All of this started because of you! You got me on Chowster! You told me to come to this festival! All good advice! Look, if it'll make you feel better, I'll do something you tell me to do. Okay, punch yourself in the face, you idiot. I just was punched in the face... by your harsh words! Look, let's just lock the doors, hunker down and wait this out. Mm. Talk to me, Goose. What's going on out there? It's Lolla-PA-snooze-a-la out there. Okay, here's what we're gonna do. (People snoring) (quietly): Jump down, Randy. I'm scared. Oh, my God. I have weak ankles. Fine, stay up. (grunts) I thought you were gonna catch me. Catch you? Why would I catch you? Boys, stop fighting! Let's do the plan! (All grunting, truck creaking) Yeah! All right! No! No, no, no! No, no, no! (All screaming) Everyone, get in! Get in! Let's get 'em! (Grunting) (tires squeal) Gene, release the grease trap. Release the grease! (Gasping) Yes! See? I knew it was funny! We're doing it! We're losing 'em. Go, us. Ooh. Nice grill. May I? Randy, no! What? (Slo-mo yell): No...! Don't worry, everybody, only 15 miles to go. We almost had it all, didn't we? At least we didn't lose this check. I've got half of it right here! That's $500. That's not how it works, Gene. Yes, it is! You're not a bank. Oh, hey, Bob, I met a really interesting guy at the festival. He's got a holistic glassblowing studio. You want take the intro class with me? Oh, yeah, I do, Randy. Really? No. Hmm, so you lied. Yeah, Dad. Blow glass with Randy and some interesting guy. That sounds great. Okay, let's play the quiet game until we get back. Oh-ho-ho, you've done it now; I am great at the quiet game. Okay, so start now. Okay, I have started. And here we go. Well, you're already losing 'cause you just said something. I'm pretty sure I'm winning. Obviously. What are you talking about? The whole point of the quiet game is to stop talking. Let's start over. Round two. Okay, here we go. You just lost again. What are you talking about? Gene? So far, two nothing, me. You just lost. Louise, you want to say something? Ah... Did I win?! (Chuckles) No, you just lost. (Snoring) (bicycle bell rings) Bob?! Oh. ♪ Oh, it's hot and wet and slick ♪

I'm a human spray bottle! Kids, just 'cause your father's not here, doesn't mean you can spit-shine the tables. Is Dad ever coming back? I don't know if it means anything, but when he kissed me good-bye this morning, he said "Goodbye Louise! I'll never ever see you again!" He's just at the dentist, Louise. Dr. Yap is dreamy. When he's looking at my molars, it's like he's looking right into my soul. Well I'm glad you like the dentist, Tina, but your father doesn't feel the same way. Getting him there is like pulling teeth. (laughs) Get it?! (anxious sigh) I don't like the OK of you. (feminine voice): "You can trust me, Bob." Yeah, but what about your friend? He looks really scary. (deep voice): I'm-a cut ya. (screams) Dr. Yap will be right with you. (high-pitched): Okay. Don't touch the instruments. They're sterile. So, it's okay, we're friends. No, it's not okay. You're not supposed to touch the instruments. I was being serious. Right, right, I'm sorry, yeah. Of course. Those aren't their voices. I know. (door bell jingles) Guess who's on new meds! Gayle! What a surprise! Look, kids, your Aunt Gayle is here. Oh, my God. You didn't even call. Who does that? Just you. And she brought a suitcase. This is the first stop on my Eat, Pray, Love trip around the world. All right! Aunt Gayle got her groove back... sexy. I'll only be here for a few days, on my way to lndonesia. Or maybe just home again and order lndonesian take-out. (grunts hungrily) All right, well, let me take your stuff upstairs. What's up with Linda lately? Wait, I brought gifts! I picked them out at a truck stop. For you Tina, a cassette tape. The original motion picture soundtrack to Milk. Cool. And for Louise... four-hour energy drink. I saved you the last 45 minutes. Thank you! And finally, for Gene, a jawbreaker. (gasps) I got candy! No fair! (laughs) I'll challenge you for it. What kind of challenge? Why don't you guys have a hug-of-war? Done! No, wait, wait! That's not fair! I love you! I love you! We can't use strength in this! Meh. Whoever makes the grossest drink gets the jawbreaker. Tina, you'll be the judge. Okay. Yeah. ♪ Doo-wah, a little bit of butter, a little bit of dirt ♪
♪ Little bit of dirt, whoo ♪ Hey. I need that! Stop it! Give it back! Bob's at the dentist today, so I gotta watch the kids and the restaurant. Well, why don't I take'em and go pick up Bob when he's ready? I've always wanted to drive a car. Oh, thank you! Ah, the new Gayle is happy and helpful... I love it. (gulping) (coughing) The use of dust from the floor was risky, but it paid off. I almost threw up. Louise wins. Yes! (grunts) Mmm! Hey, there, Bob. Ready to party? (muffled): Yeah. Ugh, what a day. What happened? I had a patient in here earlier and I accidentally stuck a needle through his cheek. Just... I hate Mondays. Oh... Uh, no, wait, wait, wait! Uh, wait, Dr. Yap, what is that? Oh, that? That's Greta. What'd you say, Greta? Huh? You ticklish? You're ticklish? You want me tickle you? You want me tickle you?! You have a really great relationship with your guitar. (playing funky guitar lick) Ah, no, wait, wait, wait. What's, uh... What's that? Oh, that's me at my $30,000 time share. I own it with six other families. Three times out of the year, I can go up there any time I want to. That sounds amaz... Wait, wait! What's that? That, my friend, is my latest graduation medallion... from The Persuasion Arts. It's the ancient art of picking up women. We follow The Prince of Persuasia's three-step program, and it works! The Prince of Persuasia? Mm-hmm. He's a prophet. And for three payments of $900, he can be your best friend. $900? That's right, Bob. Your negligent flossing habits are funding my one way ticket to Pound Town. Yeah. Well, I... Ow! I'll tell you all about it when you get back from Snooze City. Pound Town... I don't wanna see Pound Town. ♪ Town of the pound... ♪ Hello, Dr. Yap. Hi, Dr. Yap. Oh, hey, Dr. Yap. Funny running into you here. Hello, Belcher children and lady I don't know. I'm Bob's sister-in-law Gayle. Bob never mentioned he had a semi-attractive sister-in-law. Thank you. Bob never mentioned he had a dentist. (giggles) (chuckles) He's in Room One. Hey, baby. You look funny. Did you bring any honey for these biscuits? Oh! (Bob growls playfully) Oh, it's been a long time since my pillows got fluffed. You're stupid. Let's go home. For Christmas, I want to get Dr. Yap a subscription to Highlights. He loves that magazine. I'm gonna get him some laughing gas from my private tank. I'm gonna give him my business, from all this jawbreaking. Mm... (groans) Come on, baby, give me a smooch. Oh, we shouldn't... (both moaning) Your tongue feels so much different than my cat's. I guess we could go around the block one more time. (nervous laugh) Wait a second, ah... Whoo! (moans) Aah! Gayle! What are you doing here? I can't believe we did that, Bob. That was a huge mistake. We can't do it again. Although we both want to. What are you talking about? She's my sister, Bob! Linda can never know. Know what? You don't remember? We made love. What?! With our mouths. W-Wait a minute. We kissed? Yes, Bob. In the car. After you fondled my buttocks at the dentist's office. But Linda picked me up from the... Bob: Oh, God. Oh, my God. Oh, God... All these years, Bob, you could only keep those feelings bottled up for so long. Now... you're my boyfriend. Oh, God. Listen, Gayle, I was heavily drugged, okay? Tell no one. Wait, no, no. Gayle? Gayle?! Oh, no... What do I tell Linda? (whispers): Nothing. (screams) Louise: Mmm... (growls) Mm! Okay, new challenge! Whoever can listen to Teddy tell that story about his wel's the longest wins the jawbreaker. Okay, I'm game. Hi Teddy. What was that thing you were saying the other day, about your towels? Oh, about how I noticed my two towels were slightly different colors? Fascinating. Uh-huh. Right, and I was thinking, were they the same color when I bought them? Or have I washed one more than the other over the years? Great! That's it, huh? No, go on. There's more. What? Well, what do I do now? Do I wash the other one intensely to get it to match? Do I return them? Do I pretend I never noticed? Can I still use them as guest towels? When am I gonna have guests? I don't know. I don't know! What do I do? (groaning) You bought some at an estate sale once, didn't you? Oh, no, he didn't! Oh, did I tell you about that? No! You win! (laughs) I'll wait till Louise gets back. She loves my stories. Lin, we need to talk. Something happened earlier today. I know. You went to the dentist. I'm so proud of my little Bobby Baby Teeth. Linda, I kissed your sister. I was on drugs that the dentist gave me and I-I thought it was you, and now, your sister thinks we're going steady or something. That... is... wonderful! Y-You're not upset? (laughing): No, I'm not upset. Gayle is finally feeling happier and healthier, and you want to give her whatever she needs, Bobby. Whatever she needs?! What if, what if she wants to have s*x with me? Whatever she needs. s*x?! Gayle's always wanted whatever I had. I let her believe she was "dating" my high school boyfriend Carl for three years. Three years?! And after she dated Carl, she had the confidence to go after Vinny. I'totally lost. You're Carl. And, eventually, she'll find herself another Vinny. Now go get cleaned up for dinner. You have to look nice. (singsongy): ♪ I know someone who likes you. ♪ So, Gayle, are you seeing anyone right now? Funny you should ask. I actually just met someone. I feel like a teenager again. Except my breasts are more even now. Bob: Uh... It's like biting into a piece of forbidden fruit... unwashed fruit... so dirty... (grunts) This isn't happening. Gayle: I mustn't, I mustn't, but I mustn't not. (shouts) Linda, hallway, now. She had her toes on my crotch. I can't do this anymore, Lin. No, no, this is working. Now let's go have dessert. Who wants cookie dough ice cream?! Me! Yay! (deep voice): And me! Gayle: ♪ One way or another ♪

  (laughs) That's funny. So, you got any plans this weekend? Well, I have a family, so I don't really make plans. Yeah, I was gonna go up to my time share in the mountains; I invited my new hygienist. But she can't come. And she quit. You guys could go up if you want. You practically paid for half of it. Ah, no. No, thanks. Besides, my wife's sister is in town, so... Oh, you mean the amateur brunette mature that picked you up? (chuckles) I'd let that happen. Wait! Yes! You're Vinny! Let's go skiing! Allf us: You, Gayle, everyone! Boom. Yes, boom! What about kids? Can you handle some kids? Hell, yeah. It's biologically proven that children lead to s*xual intercourse and vice versa. (Frampton voice): ♪ Children lead to intercourse. ♪ Hm, I wouldn't phrase it like that. Really? You wouldn't? (Gene grunts happily) The jawbreaker may be going up the mountain with you, but it is coming down with me. What was that, Louise? I couldn't hear you with my jawbreaker in my ear. Get it out of there! Rubby-rub, ear, ear. Hey, enough! We're Dr. Yap's guests for the night, so behave, or else. Yeah, don't embarrass me. Let's just act like a normal family on vacation with their sexy dentist. Yeah... (laughing): Oop! Watch your face! (laughing) Look at that. It's working already. I told you. You make her feel good about herself and she's Dr. Yap's problem. Your work is done. So no more kissing my sister, you. (laughs) What? Huh? Hmm? Um, that's an expression for... peeing in the shower. I'm not gonna pee in the shower anymore. Why? Why doesn't he get to do that? Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Why can't I? And why bring it up now? It goes right down the drain. You know what? Let's all kiss our sister. (kids cheer) It seems like you and Dr. Yap are really hitting it off. You planned the perfect cover for us to have a romantic getaway. What? No. No cover. No. You pretend to flirt with Linda, I'll fake-flirt with Dr. Yap and then we can sneak off and hit the slopes... my slopes! Let there be light. Welcome to the Yap Trap! You caught me. I'll give you guys a grand tour. Linda, Bob, this is your room. Soundproof walls. (quietly): So don't hold back. I can yell anything I want; no one can hear me! Gene (muffled): I love my family! Gene. And here's the kids' room. Mirrors on the ceiling. Hey Dr. Yap, look up. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Okay, see you back in real life. Hi. That's funny. There's only one more bedroom but two people left. Me and Gayle. Yeah, Gayle, this room looks comfy. Why don't we just put your bags in here? No. I think I'd rather stay with you and Linda. Ho-ho, Lady Gayle. Don't you worry. We'll figure it out later. And last, but not least... "Jacooze." (chuckles) It doesn't get hot, but the bubbles still work. (quietly): We can make it hot. Hey, who's ready to go skiing? Let's get dressed. Yap, I thought you were hitting it off with Gayle. What happened? She's a fighter, Bob. I like it. And I have The Prince on my side. Hello there, my brothers. I almost didn't see you. I am... The Prince of Persuasia! There are three steps to persuading women. Step number one: Trap your princess. Physically corner her in a room and eventually, in your life. Step two: Insult your princess. Insult her face, her body, her brain, her car. The lower her self-esteem, the higher your chances, bro. It's been biologically proven. By me. Step three: Brag. Not lying, but close. Make up a story about how you single-handedly m*rder*d a wild animal. Your story is going to release a hormone, deep inside her body, called lnsatia. It makes women ovulate. For s*x. (quietly): Interesting. Woop. Oops. Oops. Oops. Whoops. Well, Gene and Louise don't want to ski, but you guys, you want to take a lesson? We don't need a lesson. Are you serious? You both know how to ski? Tina and I came up here for the Tom Selleck charity event... Ski for Babies. For every jump he went off, they were gonna give $100 to a baby. Yeah, but he was a no-show. All these people standing around with cameras. And babies. All right, fine. I'll skip the lesson and figure it out as I go. Whoo-hoo! Lin! Grab my hand! Whah-ha! Take me with you! Sorry! Missed ya! Aah! Oh, God. Step one: Trap him. Oh, Bob. This is our chance. (groaning): Oh, Gayle. No. We can't. Not here. It's too visible. We should do it in the forest. Right. Or the parking lot. Great. Step two: Insult your princess. Your face is fat. No, it's not. It's perfect. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What's that? ♪ La, la, la! ♪ Livin' it up! ♪ Okay, we each shovel snow into our pants. First person to give up, get hypothermia, or die, loses. Okay. (both grunting) I'm fine. I love it. Yeah, I don't feel anything. This is great. Ahh... This feels incredible! (screaming) Here you go. Thank you very much. (groans) All right, I'll leave you two love birds alone. See you at the bottom! Yeah, last time I was out in the wilderness, I had to snap a wolf's neck while holding an orphan. Bob! Wait for me! One time, in P.E., I beat a dog at basketball. Playing hard to get, I see. Playing hard to get, I see. Here we go! (James Bond-like espionage theme playing) I love your ski suit, Dr. Yap. What size are you? I'm a men's petite six. Ooh, big boy. You wanna swap later? Swapsies! Last one down's a chimichanga! Hey, Bob! Let's look for a secluded part of the woods, so we can be alone. No, thanks. I'm good. Uh! Aah! Perfect. I'll just follow your lnsatia trail. (inhales deeply) (sultry exhale) (inhales deeply) Ah! Ah! (muffled): I'm okay. Okay. Who can build a better snowman? Ho-oh! Are you kidding me? I practically majored in snowman building. Nuh-uh-uh. Up there... Ooh... Bob! I'm gonna catch you! Gayle! This isn't funny! I'm out of control! Me, too! Mine's name is Greglisa, the androgynous snowman! He/She's from Thailand. Mine is a self-portrait of me in the future, when I own a falcon who holds my jawbreaker for me. (Bob and Louise scream) (Gene screams) No! (laughing) I win! Hey, where's the jawbreaker? Ow! Ow! What the hell? Oh, my God. I broke my tooth. Gayle: Finally, Bob. We're alone. Gayle, wait, I hurt myself. I'm not wearing anything under my snowsuit. Oh, my God! Except for my long underwear. And my socks. And my other socks. And a maxi pad. Ow! Gayle! This is serious. I need Dr. Yap. We don't need him anymore, Bob. Bob: Ow! Hi, Bob. Dr. Yap! Thank God you're here. This one's here. But this one's down here. Gayle! Bobby! Linda. Good. This has gone too far. And I broke my tooth. Tell everybody what's going on here. These two were fooling around, Linda. Oh, Linda, I am so sorry you had to witness our foreplay. I can't believe this! You're a hurtful slut, Bob! I can't take this anymore, Lin. You need to tell Gayle what's going on. Enough's enough. Ow! My tooth! Stop! Lin, please, drop the act! I'm in serious pain here! Good! It looks to me like you're in need of some serious dental work. And a smack! Ow! I don't have any Novocain with me, Bob, so... (Bob mumbles) Unfortunately for you... (mumbles) ... you'll be experiencing some pain. (mumbling): Uh-uh. A little pain might do him some good. Bring him back to his senses. No! I need drugs! Let's tie his tooth to the front door and then order a pizza and tell the guy to let himself in. That's stupid. Let's tie it to a deer, and then tell the deer he's late for a meeting! (mumbled): Gene. We're two princes, Bob. And we're going after the same princess. (whispers): But only one of us has pliers. (kisses) Why'd you kiss me? Stop it! No! Noooo! Yes! I have Dad's tooth! Who am I? Who am I? (deep voice): I'm Dad! Ow! My tooth hurts! Ow! I want it! Challenge me for it. Whoever drinks the most Jacuzzi water wins! Sold. Yeah! Dr. Yap, earlier today, I fell for you. But after watching you torture my father, I think we should just be friends. With dental benefits. Okay. Hey, now that Bob's out of the picture, maybe you and I could hop in the "Jacooze" for a nice cold dip, hmm? Eh, let me know when Bob wakes up. But... I-I did all three steps! (woeful sigh) Nobody likes me! Aw, people like you. (high-pitched squeals, sobs) Shh, shh. Little baby. Little baby. You don't worry about Gayle, okay? You're a good guy. A real catch. No! No! Ow... What happened? You! Linda wasn't enough, huh? So you had to have Gayle, too? Well, maybe if you dropped the whole persuasion thing, Gayle might actually pay attention to you. Well, Linda pays attention to me. In fact, she said she wanted to get in my snow suit. Didn't you, Linda? What? I did? You did?! Wait a minute! You're in love with Dr. Yap?! Hmm... Yes! I am in love with Dr. Yap. You are? Wait, what is going on here? Well, that's too bad, because I'm in love with him. I knew it from the moment we met that this short, weird, musky dentist was the man of my dreams. Makes sense. He's mine! No, he's mine! (both women grunting) Who wants me more? Don't be gentle. No! Come on, Dr. Yap. Let's go. See? It all worked out. It all worked out?! You slapped me. I lost a tooth. When I saw her on top of my Bobby, kissing him and touching him... oh, I went mental. Well, I'll never kiss your sister again. Next challenge! First person to catch a squirrel wins! I'm the Squirrel Whisperer. But you put me up to this. Yeah, well, I didn't appreciate seeing it with my own eyes. But hey, at least we got to go skiing, right? That was fun. Right? Gene: Got one! No fair! It's dead! It's not dead. It's sleeping. Gene wins the tooth. Come on! Yeah! Let's get out of here, squirrel. The Prince: Dress like her dad. It release a hormone called moan-a-tonin. When you get into an elevator with a woman, press a higher number than her, and then make a big deal about it. Push her in a lake. Be one of the tallest guys in the bar, and brag about how long your butt-crack is. Sing a song that you supposedly heard on the radio, and make fun of her for not knowing it. Use the word "idiot." Never make her pancakes. Force her to make you pancakes, in the middle of the night.
Dad, don't forget monkey brains. Yeah, and we need more unicorn testicles. That's where dreams are born. All right, we'll get those, then head back to the restaurant. I just need fresh kale for the burger of the day... "If Looks Could Kale." Ha! Hey, Reggie, I didn't know you guys shopped here for your restaurants. What happened, Pepe? And why is your face painted like a cat? I lost my restaurant. We're trying to cheer him up. I'm a kitty. I'm a kitty. You didn't read the review? Three weeks after the Moody Foody's hatchet job, Pepe's taco joint is a yoga studio. A hot yoga studio. I bet, when it heats up, it smells like taco meat. Like my underwear. The Moody Foody's on a rampage. He nitpicks every little thing, Bob. He said my bread was stale. Well, it is pretty stale, Reggie. That's 'cause I buy day-old bread! Okay. Okay. I've been mapping the Moody Foody's patterns for months. He follows a precise ethnic sequence in restaurants: Asian, European, Latin, American. Like Larry King with his wives. Man, you guys are obsessed with this critic. You should be, too! According to my calculations, you're next. Um... okay, that's fine. For all you know, he's already reviewed you. He's a master of disguise. Yeah, when he reviewed my place, he was dressed like a construction worker. For me, he was an E.R. doctor. Before every meal, he wipes his hands with a blue handkerchief. Blue. Watch for that, Bob... blue. (whimpers) Here you go... $30. What? No, I didn't ask for these. Nobody asks. You describe it, you buy it. Oh, look. He even got the hanky. Tina: Can you draw me on a horse with a zombie riding behind me? No. Draw a picture of my dad's mustache really giving it to a caterpillar. No, don't do that. Do it! Do it! Do it! Hold on to these sketches, Bob. They could save your restaurant. Uh, Tran, my restaurant will be fine. After all, Reggie's bread is stale. And, Pepe, your carne asada isn't even beef. Carne asada is beef? And Tran's noodles are... So what? I reuse my noodles. If people don't eat them all, I'm supposed to just waste them? It's just, no offense, fellas, but I use fresh ingredients, so, you know, I should be all right if this critic comes. Offense taken. Here's you on a horse with a zombie. 50 dollars. Dad, pay the man. No, $50... for that? $50... it's a little girl, a horse and a zombie. Dad, that's so cheap for what you're getting. Look, if the critic comes, it's just another customer, you know? I know. Just a customer who can shut us down with one bad review... that's all. I know he can destroy us, Lin. I don't need a pep talk. And if I did, this would be a horrible pep talk. It's him, Dad. It's the Moody Foody. Bob: Gene, that's Mike the Mailman. You've seen him every day for the past five years. It's the long con. It's him. Tina, that's Gene. Long con. Thanks, Mike. Yeah, thanks, "Mike." I cannot hear you. That's got to be the food critic. A Civil War reenactor? Ah, can't stand all that drab gray. No wonder they lost. All right, keep an eye out for the blue handkerchief. ("Dixie" ringtone plays) Hello? You're really sorry? Okay, I'll... I'll come do the battle. For the record, the buttons are authentic. All right, everyone, back to work. We're not going to stand around and wait for a food critic who may or may not ever show up. Dad, Dad, another Civil War reenactor is here. He must be fighting for the North. Bob: It's a Hasidic Jew, Gene. You know that. Blue hanky! Blue hanky! Blue hanky? Blue hanky? Yes, blue hanky! That's the Moody Foody! (gasps) Blue hanky! Blue hanky! Right there... blue hanky! Aah! Hanky panky! Blue hanky right there! Blue hanky! Gene: Hanky panky! Quick, circumcise Gene. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Circumcise me! Circumcise me! Quick, quick! Okay, the Moody Foody is here in our restaurant. This is happening now. Do you need a diversion? I'll scream. Cockroach! Gene. Let's bribe him. Dad, take out the lettuce and replace it with this $20 bill. That I took out of your wallet. Oh, or tape it to his back. That's not how a bribe works, Tina. (muffled): Yes, it is! Now, everybody calm down, all right? We just do what we do... we give him a delicious meal, we get a positive review, and that's that. Yeah, 'cause if we don't, it's curtains. We're done. Lin, stop pep-talking! Wha...? Let's just take a deep breath... (sighs heavily) Not like that. (muffled sigh) (exhales) Where'd Tina go? She's out taking the critic's order. No, no, no. Time for the charm b*mb to explode. Hi there, customer. Is someone hungry? That's why I'm here. Are you ready to order? Uh, yeah. I just need another second. Are you just going to stand there and stare at me? Uh-huh. Oh, God. (Linda sighing) Louise, go get Tina. Shift's over, sweetheart. Let's talk Palestine. Or my order, we could talk about. Oh, God, Lin, go get Louise. All right, all right, all right. (gulping) Shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo. How we... (belches) ... doing today? The food here is so delicious. I'm a customer. Try the pad Thai. Mmm. Okay, everyone, great job. Back in the kitchen. Sorry about all that. Um, I'd like to recommend the burger of the day... the "If Looks Could Kale" burger. (chuckling) Uh, you get it? Mm-hmm. Uh, well, you're not laughing. I don't think you got it. "If Looks Could Kale." Yeah, I-I got it. (sighs) I'll have a cheeseburger. Coming right up. (whispering): That guy's creeping me out. Okay, it got a little rocky out there, but we righted the ship. I set it up, you knock it down. Right, Dad? Yeah... right. Thanks, Tina. Smooth sailing. Just like every day. So, well, what kind of burger did he order? Crap. So, I know we discussed having the burger of the day, but I want to say you didn't want that. Where did we land, uh, in the end? You seriously don't remember? No, I do. Um... cheeseburger. Just remembered. I just remembered on my own. Cheeseburger! Gene: Got it. Gene: Uh-oh! Oh, God. Gene: Aah! That's just the 3:00 fire. Your burger may take an extra minute. In the meantime, enjoy the show. Gene! Oof. (groaning sigh) Ugh. (groans) "Overdone and dry." It's like, uh, "above and beyond," right? (groans) It's not bad. What about "insufferable"? What's that? Maybe that just means he didn't suffer. That's good news. I've seen some murders in my line of work, but what a hit job. Wait, here's something good. "The best part of the meal was..." "Continued on page 45." "... was the napkin I spat my food into. Thank you, little napkin." Oh. This is my fault. I screwed up the burger. It's my fault. So it's settled. Wait a minute. You screwed up. And you and you. All right, stop the finger-pointing. (sighs) I'm sorry. I... sometimes I forget how horrible you all are at your jobs. You're all horrible! Sorry. I mean, you are horrible, but I shouldn't have said it so loud. All right, okay. That's enough of the papers. But you are! Okay, okay, enough. Stop... How bad could everybody be?! Stop the yelling. Who cares about one bad review? Don't be such a baby. Come, come, come. This is one of my vacant spaces. It used to be a burger restaurant. Hi, Bob. Hey, Mr. Fish. How are you? Hi, Mrs. Burger. Good. Uh, Mr. Fischoeder, this is still a burger restaurant. Yeah, let us die slowly in peace, you vulture. Right you are. One bad review won't sink the SS Bob, will it? You're like a benign tumor. With a little bit of hair and teeth. I'm like a tumor with teeth? Sounds cute. Yes, little man. It's a compliment. Let's come back in a week. It should be empty by then. Don't worry, Bobby. People can make up their own minds. You'd be surprised. They don't need some critic. As long as we get Michelin-recommended, we'll be fine. Order up. (groaning) What? What? Something wrong with the burger? No, uh, it's fine. It's just... maybe you missed the mark with this one, is all, you know? What? What do you mean, Teddy? I don't know, Bobby. Just tastes a little... overdone and dry or something. Overdone and dry, Teddy? You're just quoting the review. No, I know. It's just, now I have words to put to my tastes. Will you get a mind of your own, Teddy? I mean, seriously... with your dead eyes! What? My eyes aren't dead. He's not dead. No, I'm fine. And you, Mort. What did I... what did I do? Whatever! (sighs) Lin, this review is going to be the end of us. People think we're terrible now. Not terrible. We're not terrible. Bobby, you know that. Look at me. I know that, but it doesn't matter. We have one crappy day, and then everybody reads about it, and now that's what they think... forever. Man: Hey, how about this place? Oh, yeah? Well, your haircut's overdone and dry! And you, your pants are overdone and dry! Look at your dumb face! It's overdone and dry! Get back here, people! Where are you going? I want to review you Yeah! I'm going to review everyone! You're getting it! Overdone and dry! Overdone and dry! Overdone and dry! Overdone and dry! Overdone and dry! Overdone and dry! "Two thumbs down... my throat." (chuckles) That's just rude.

What happened to Belcher? Recent events have left the name, Belcher, badly tarnished. Tina? Here's Dad's image before the review. Here's Dad's image after the review. Rock bottom. Aw. They made a poster, Bobby. Uh, you guys were there, too... remember?... destroying our business. Hey, hey, hey. Um, I'm pretty sure I was in Sausalito that day. I'm pretty sure you weren't, Gene!

  (laughs) I love this song. Sam my man from Uzbekistan! You got the Bob in the house! A lot of e-mails. Mostly spam. What is that, ramen? Tea. Oh. I thought it was ramen. No. Tea. Hey, what are we talking about? I thought Kathy was making ramen. For some reason, I saw noodles. Nope, just tea. Huh. (groaning) (air hissing) (hushed): Hey, it's Jason's birthday. Did you sign the card? (whispers): Not yet. Oh, here. To the J-man. (groans) It's good cake. My wife made it. (a la Borat): My wife! (all laugh) Borat! Hey, do it again! Jeff, get in here! You gotta hear this! My wife! Yes! No! ... 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 35... Linda, kids, napkin holder, ice cream machine! Oh, come here! Dirty spot on the counter that I can never get out! Get over here! I love you. What the hell is wrong with you? I had a nightmare, Lin. I worked in an office. I had to sign a birthday card. Don't touch me. You're all sweaty. I hate signing birthday cards. You sign ours. Actually, your mother does it for me. Oh. Sorry. Like we read those things. Where's the money? (chuckles) You know, I realized I'm not a cubicle guy. I can't do it. I can't do anything other than this. Yeah, look at you. If this restaurant fails, I'm gonna k*ll myself. There he is, that's the spirit. Yup. You should ask for a redo. A what? A redo. One time, to get out of a Spanish test, Kelly Mathis forced herself to throw up. I mean, vomite. Hmm. Then another time, to get out of a math test, she forced herself to get her period. That's how she got a redo. A redo! That's genius! We'll get our period! No, a redo. No, period! I'm gonna walk over to the Moody Foody's house and cook him dinner! Wine him, dine him, 59 him, Dad! That's right, Gene! (growls) Thank you, Tina. This time I'm gonna make the Moody Foody a great burger. All right! If you think that's the right move, I trust ya... kinda. Chant me out! Kids: Redo! Redo! Redo! Redo! Let's go watch this train wreck. All: Stalking Dad quietly! Stalking Dad quietly! Oh, well, well, well, the guy who couldn't remember my order finds my address? How'd you manage that? Well, let's just say some of my fellow disgruntled restauranteurs have been dumpsacking your house. Oh, yes, the flaming bags of poop. But I'm not here to do that, all right? I-I came here to cook you another burger. Oh, well that's so ni... I'd rather be dumpsacked. Listen, I know your Bob's Burgers experience was subpar. I just want a redo. Of course you do. Great! Let's get started then. Where's the kitchen? Ah! What is that?! It's a Taser! Ow! That stings! What is that supposed to do? It's supposed to incapacitate you. I'm gonna send in a bad review. I am... not shocked. Hey! Oh, oh, I'm calling the police! Don't, don't. Wait! I just want to cook you dinner! I just want you to try my burger, okay? Get off me! Just let me cook you a burger! Ow! Ah! You're biting me! Ah! Get... Ow! Stop! Dad, we felt we should be here as your PR fir... Oh, yes! This doesn't look like a redo. Tickle fight! Hyah! Listen, kids, taping people to chairs is bad, okay? Never do this. We're just helping him calm down so that he can enjoy this burger. Bye-bye, frown! Now it's a smile! There. Comfy? (angry grunting) Good. This is an old classic of mine. It's called the "Girls Just Wanna Have Fennel" burger, huh? God. Was that a nose laugh, huh? Ow! No! Oh. I laughed, Dad. Thanks, Tina. Yeah, me, too! Don't tie us up! Okay, big boy bite. No, nuh-uh, no. Not happening. Uh-huh, uh-huh. Mm-mm. All aboard the burger train! No, I'm not getting on the... Open up the tunnel. Choo-ch-ch-ch... Mm-mm, mm-mm. (doorbell rings) Are you expecting someone? Oh, that must be my next kidnapper. Linda: Bobby, you in there? Lin? What are you all doing here? Linda told us about the redo. We brought food from our restaurants. I brought no food because that man, he ruined my restaurant. So... how's it going? Uh, not great. He won't eat my burger. What? Well that's just rude. Linda, wait, don't... Bobby... (gasps) you've taken him hostage? (chuckles) No, no. He's in his own home. "Hostage" is a little much. It's not that. No, no, "hostage" sounds about right. Shut up! This is dark, Bob. Real dark. I'll go get the jumper cables out of my car. No, no, no, no, no. This should catch any blood or bodily fluids. No blood, no jumper cables. Yes, jumper cables! The man Tased you, Dad! I just want him to eat my burger. (gasps) You Tased my Bobby and you won't eat his burger? Well, we'll just see about that, won't we? Now all aboard the burger train! Open up the tunnel, li'l baby! I tried that already. Didn't work. Oh. We can make him eat. Oh, goody. Are those the exact noodles I didn't finish three months ago? No, they are the noodles somebody didn't finish yesterday. So, there! Oh, yeah? Well eat this! Mm-mm! Mm-mm! Hey, come on! Come on! Well, if you won't eat our food, then choke on your reviews, huh?! Does this taste like enchilad-ass? All: Eat it! Eat it! Eat it! Eat your words, all of 'em! All right! So, Moody, eat the foody. Guys, stop! Shove it in there, you get it in! Guys! This is crazy. He's not worth it. You're right, no one will miss him. No, Pepe! That's not what I meant. (doorbell rings) What now?! He tripped the silent alarm. Delivery. I need someone to sign. Help! He's seen too much! No, no, no, no, no, no! All right, this redo is officially out of control. Just now? That's when it's out of control? Uh, breaking and entering, kidnapping. Oh, and now opening other people's mail! It's not what I envisioned. What the hell is this? You bought Tin Cup? That's a terrible movie. You mean "classic"? I like Tin Cup. But it's a bad movie, right? You ever see it? No, I didn't see it. Then how do you know it's bad? I don't know. It's just bad, right? People think it's bad. I think I read a review of it or something. See? You didn't bother to see the Tin Cups because some critic gave it a bad review! Hypocrite! Who knows? Maybe you would have loved Tin Cups. Tin Cup. Tin Cup. Tin Cups. No, it's Tin Cup. Tin Cup. Tin Cup. Yes. Tin Cup. Tin Cup. This is k*ll*ing me! Good, 'cause it's all your fault! You're right. You know, you may have taped down my arms, but you have opened my eyes! I'll never give a bad review again! Yay! In fact, I'm gonna go back and change all my bad reviews to glowing ones... and add smiley faces. I think he might be joking! Reggie, he is. Enough talk! Do what you're gonna do to these guys! Nobody's doing anything. He did his job. And you know what? I'm gonna go do mine. Come on. Let's go back to our restaurants and cook. Those of you that still have restaurants. Oh, that's messed up. He's talking about me! (yells) Bob's got a point. What are we even doing here? I should be back at my restaurant smell-checking the meats. From now on, I will only dumpsack him when I'm in the neighborhood. But you took the fun out of it. Sorry you got mixed up in this. So, uh, what's it gonna take for you to forget about today? (gasps) $350. $350?! Yeah. Um, all right, fellas, cough it up. Ah! I don't have a... I forgot, um... Seriously? You're not talking about me. I, uh, have, um... $48 here. Give me the DVD. You want Tin Cup? Does it have any special features? Yeah, It's got outtakes. But they call them "Mulligans." Oh, come on! Before we cut this guy loose, I just want one slap, okay? In the back of the head. You should give him a purple nurple. No, wet willy! What is a wet willy? A Guillermo mojado. Ah. You do it. I have no spit. Willy! Willy! Willy! Willy! Willy! Willy! Willy! Guillermo. Guillermo. Okay, one wet willy. ("Stuck in the Middle with You" begins) (gasps) (gasps) (screams) (crow squawks) Kevin Costner (on TV): That's how you make a birdie! Rene Russo: You're in the rough, McAvoy. That's okay. I like it rough. Is she still talking about golf? One of the top five Don Johnson movies, Tin Cup. Are you still doing the half-off-your-meal... meal-when-you-bring-in- a-bad-review promotion? Yes, the promotion brought to you by PR giant, Cooper... Great. Nice to have business back on track. Yeah, but Bobby, I'm still so nervous the cops are gonna show up. Yeah. I wonder if he called the cops. (distant phone ringing) Hmm. 911. What's your emergency? 911. What's your emergency. Sir? Hmm. Mmm. Hello? Mmm! Sir? Oh...! Great. Another one of these calls. Get a girlfriend! Well, if the cops come, we need a plan. We can put Dad in a dress and tell them he's our aunt. Yeah, we'll call him "Aunty Man Hands." She came into town for Dad's funeral. Oh, plot twist. I'm not gonna wear a dress. Pantsuit? Okay, fine. I'll go get some pantsuits! Fashion show!
(dog barks) (tires screech) Okay, everyone, I hope you've all chosen your lab partners wisely. I have. You'll notice a mixture in front of you on the Bunsen burner. Buns... sen. This mixture is the most powerful love potion known to man. Whatever you do, don't drink it. Jimmy Junior, no! It will make you want to touch each other's butts! Too late. I don't need a love potion to want to do that stuff... with you. (glass shatters) Miss Jacobson: Chad doesn't have a partner. Maybe he can join you. (moans) The more the merrier. (moans) Linda: Kids...! Linda: Time for breakfast! Damn. What kind of a maniac wakes up an hour early to write erotic fan fiction? Me. Louise: Are there any shows or movies left in the world that you haven't perved up? No. That's why I've started writing erotic friend fiction. Using people at school and zombies. Oh! Do the janitor and the vice principal. I think they'd have beautiful children. I did and they don't. Good morning, my little late bird. What's with the vest? It's my Welcome Wagon vest. I'm showing a new girl around school today. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, Bob, this is what we're seeing tonight! Ugh. Commercial Announcer: Experience patty cake like never before. Cake. The New York Times says, "Cake makes everything we've been doing with our hands obsolete." This week at the Wharf Arts Center. War Farts! Wow. What a must-miss. No kidding. Stop it. We're going. (chanting): Let's get to Cake as fast as we can! Ah! Bob: Ugh. This is the cafeteria, And that's our American flag... Tina, no offense, but this tour is giving me a snore-gasm. Show me something good. Well, there's a typo on the lunch menu. It says "browie." Seriously, what do you do for fun around here? I think there's more on the Tina tour than you're showing me. Okay. There is one place I like to go. Tammy: What is this? Tina: The boys' locker room. You can only see up to their ankles. So, you just go around looking through random holes? Yes, but not anymore. Now I just look through this one. Those are Jimmy Junior's feet. I can tell by the way he walks. So confident, but still figuring things out. Zeke: Ha! (chuckles) Jimmy Jr.: No, Zeke! Skid marks. (chuckles) That's not funny. They're stripes. Smelly stripes. (chuckles) Zeke: Phew, you stink! Tammy: Okay, and who is that? Zeke. He's got some hyper in his diaper. I'd like to see what that shin bone's connected to. Tammy, don't. Someone might see us. Man: Hey, what's going on in there? Hi, Coach Blevins. (Tina groans) I can't believe I got detention. It's no big deal, Tina. Don't have a crap attack. Sucks they give you detention for wrestling in the library. What is this, Nicaragua? Yeah, this school's lame, right, Zeke? (Zeke scoffs) That's Jimmy Junior and Zeke. The feet from the locker room. Mm, manimal. Introduce me, okay? (smacks lips) Here. Oh. Mmuh, mm... Hey Jimmy Junior! Zeke. This is Tammy. She's new at school. Hey, (giggles) What's... Hi, what's up? My loog. (hacks, then spits) (grunts) You like that, baby? No. Nice loogie, Zeke. Hey, Jimmy Junior, look at this. (hacking, chokes, coughing) I'm okay. Tina! Where the hell have you been? Did you fall in something shiny on your lips? Mm. (smacks lips) Strawberry. I got detention. Others: Detention?! Really? I can't believe this! Detention is no big deal, Mom. Don't have a crap attack. What did you just say? A crap attack. Don't have one. (gasps) Don't you tell me not to have a crap attack! I'll have a crap attack any time I want! Now, go to your room! This is such a snore-gasm. (exhales) What the hell was that about? What is it? Yeah. A crap attack? I don't know. Do you? Don't look at me. Well, you're the one that wanted to have one. You're the one that sent her to her room for saying it. I don't know what these kids are saying. Don't have a crap attack. (laughing and screaming) Nice, Bob. Nice. (giggles) I can't believe Tina got detention. She's changing, Bobby. Tina's turning into a teen. You've lost her, Mom. Time to focus on your good daughter. Gene. I'm pretty. You know, maybe you're overreacting, Lin. I mean, you did have a crap attack. Ha...! She's supposed to baby-sit tonight while we're at Cake. Can we even trust her now? That's a good point. Maybe we should stay home. What? Please? We're not skipping Cake. Okay, fine. But I'm gonna complain the whole time. Yeah! You're the baddest girl in detention, Tina. Tell me about it, stud. (giggles) I'm a stud. I'm an idiot. I know, Zeke. Don't talk anymore Tammy, spill that. Jimmy Junior, mop that up with your pants. Okay. Linda: Tina! We're waiting for you! (big sigh) We need to go over some ground rules for tonight, Miss Mouthy. No boys, no parties, no summoning spirits or switching bodies, and no filling the house with soap bubbles. You hear me, Tina? Yes. I wear glasses, not hearing aids, Mom. Ho! Well, I don't wear a hearing aid either, so I didn't hear that. Haw! Well, good night. What are you doing with the emergency cell phone? Texting my friend Tammy. That'll cost a fortune! We have a terrible data plan! Tammy wants to come over. I texted back a smiley face. She texted back some letters I don't understand. I think she's coming over. Oh, my God, is she or isn't she? I can't wait to ha... (snores) Louise, wake up, Louise! (screaming) Ugh. Huh? Cute room. I used to have one of these. I cut its mane off. I bet that looked cool. I'm totally going to do that. (whispers): No, I won't. This is like watching two monkeys at the puberty zoo. What's wrong with her face? Looks like she needs a flu sh*t in her eyes. What's this? It's my erotic friend fiction. "Tina reached towards Jimmy Junior's butt: "'Your lips say no but your butt says yes.'" This is hilarious! It's not meant to be hilarious. It's supposed to be erotic. Maybe you don't understand it. Oh, I understand. And I'm into it. But never let Jimmy Junior see this. He'd be weirded out and he'd never talk to you again. Really? Oh, my God, there's a little drawing here of Jimmy Junior's butt. (laughs) (farts) Wha...? What just happened? I think Tammy laugh-farted. That really smells, Tammy. What? I didn't fart, you did! Oh. Okay. Come on, if you're gonna be loud, you gotta be proud! Anyway, since you're such a good writer, how about texting Zeke and Jimmy Junior and inviting them over? I need a Zeke peek. I'm not allowed to have boys over. (groans) Come on, Tina. Bring your friend fiction to life. Uh... Come on, do it, do it. Do it, Do it. Good. Okay, okay. I'll tell them to get their butts over here. Yeah. How do you do an emoticon for butt? Three. Three... three... Oh, I hope you got a jar to pee in, Gene. We're gonna be in here a long time. I've got Tina's rain boot. Okay. I'll take the other one. (rhythmic clapping) Isn't her hair cute? I did it. Do I look just like Tammy? This is Tina talking, not Tammy. Uh, I know who you are. Oh, 'cause I look like Tammy. No, not really. When I'm 14, I'm gonna shave my head bald. You guys want to play truth or dare? Great, good. I dare us all to drink this! Margarita Mix! The heavy stuff! Cool. That's my mom's! I know, I took a little booze cruise through your living room. Does margarita mix have alcohol in it? No. Mom uses it to fill the humming bird feeder. (gulps) Oh, my God, I totally feel it. Whoo! Come on now, let's kick on some tunes! I want to hear some FM, baby. (grunting) You're disgusting. Whoo! Whoo-hoo! Oh, my God. I can't stop. Come on, girl! Come on! I can't stop! I can't stop! I'm dancing! I'm dancing, baby! (gasps) My porcelain horse, Horselain! Leg's broke. We gotta sh**t it. Sorry, Horselain. Let's shift into after-party mode. (turns off radio) Okay, after party is over. Time to go home. Come on, Tina. We were just starting to have fun. I got to go anyway. My dad's girlfriend just had a baby and she's nursin'. I want to go check that stuff out. I'd check that out with you, Zeke. Tina: I'll walk you out. Come on, Tammy! (sighs) So lame. Later, square bear. Bye. (sighs) Louise: Tina, Tina, Tina. Or should we say Margaritina? Don't tell Mom and Dad. Okay, but it's gonna cost you. $10,000. Or... you do all our chores for a month! Oh, that's better. That's better. First chore: rinse all the pee out of these boots. And this one needs plunging! Linda: We're back! Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad. How was Cake? Eh... Loved it! It made me so hungry. Now, I'm craving cake. Who wants to cake with me? Gene? No thanks. Ever. Oh, you changed your hair. Or maybe her hair changed her. ♪ Dum dum dum. ♪ 

  There's nothing sweet in here. Maybe I'll have a drink instead. No! No? What's gotten into you, Little Miss Mommy Can't Drink? You did hit those Sambucas pretty hard during intermission, Lin. Hey! If they didn't want you to pound 'em down, they'd give you more than ten minutes, right? Oh, you are drunk, Mom. No, I'm not. Yeah, 'cause you're yelling. I'm talking normal. Hm. Mommy doesn't get drunk. She just has fun. Crackers, where's the crackers? You're coming to bed with me. Come on. (sighs with relief) Hey, Tina, since you crapped out last night, I talked Zeke and Jimmy Junior into cutting and going to the mall. Cutting what? Cutting classes. Come on. You owe me. Sorry, Tammy. I don't want to cut. I thought you might be like this. (gasps) That's my erotic friend fiction! Uh-uh-uh. See, this stays with me. And if you don't stop acting like a prude-a-bega and come to the mall, I'm going to give it to Jimmy Junior! But you said if he ever saw it, he'd never talk to me again. Yeah. It's called a threat. Oh. But I thought we were friends. We are. That's why I'm making you go on a double date with me. Don't be such a boob punch. Okay. But first, let's fix you up. Hello, Glamsterdam. Now we're ready to go to the mall. Ollie (screams): Bathroom clowns! much better than being in school right now? Yeah. Hell, yeah! I guess. Jimmy Junior, what do you think of Tina's new look? Pretty trash-tastic, huh? Yeah, I mean... sort of. Piercing booth! Y'all do nips or scrotes? Tina, let's get our tongues pierced! I-I don't want to pierce my tongue. Yes, you do. No, I really don't. Jimmy Junior, you can read, right? Yeah. Mr. School. Not really. Fine. I'll do it. But I only have three dollars and a coupon for my dad's restaurant. Okay. What can we get for that? I can give you temporary tattoos. Temp tramp stamps! Where's Tina? She should be doing this. I'm so tired of being hurt by her. It's a bunch of grown-ups playing patty-cake. I don't get it, Bob. Then you don't get me, Teddy. You don't get me. Oh, he's been slapping everything since we got back from that show. It's called "caking," Lin. You know. You were there. No, I don't know. No. I fell asleep. Come on. Do it with me. No! My hands still hurt from yesterday. Teddy? How about you? Put up your hands. No, thank you. I just kind of want to cake with somebody! All right. Ow! I don't like it, I don't like it. Stop! Keep your hands up! I don't like it! I don't like this! Keep 'em up! Just stop! Just stop, Bob. I don't like it. Don't lower your hands, Teddy! You're scaring him. Oh... He's crying. It's not fun for everyone, Bob. (bell on door chimes) Tina! You're late! You didn't get detention again, did you? No. I'm just late, okay? What is all that goop on your face? And why are you showing so much skin? (sighs) (sighs) Is that a dinosaur over your tar pit? Here you go. What? No. Oh, you want us to tell Mom and Dad about your margarita party? And your new tat? Uh... no, I'll do it. Oh, okay! And when you're done here, change my litter box. And don't tell Mom and Dad about my litter box. Tina! There you are. I told Zeke and Jimmy Junior that we'd hang out at the park tonight, and you'd bring margaritas. No, Tammy, I can't. Ah! Tina! Can't you tell that Jimmy Junior likes the new you? Yeah, I guess. Then why do you keep fighting it? I wish I didn't have to force you have fun. Sorry. You know what? Let's see what happens when we lose the glasses. They kind of make your face look like math class. Thank you? No, math class is bad. Oh. There we go. That's so much better, right? Yeah. Ah! Oh, no. Ow. Tina? Tina? What the hell is going on? I wasn't sneaking out. Try again! Over here. Woo-hoo! What happened to your glasses? And where were you going with my margarita mix? I was just gonna meet some people at the park. What? (phone buzzing) Hold on. The emergency phone's buzzing. "Where are you?" Who the hell is texting the emergency phone? It's my friend Tammy. What? Can I just text her back? She'll be really mad if I don't. No! You may not text her back, or anyone. Mom! Stop being a boob punch. Boob punch? Your mother's not being a boob punch, Tina. That's it. You're grounded. (Tina sighs, phone buzzes) "Your three is grass." I don't get it. Oh. "Your ass is grass." It's not funny. I didn't say it was funny. I just said I figured it out. (tap) (tap) Why weren't you at the park? I looked like an idiot! I'm sorry. I got grounded. You wrecked my chances with Zeke. That's actually good, Tammy. Zeke's really gross. I don't feel that way! Please don't give my journal to Jimmy Junior. Oh, I'm not. Oh, good. Yeah, no, I'm going to read your freak fiction out loud to everyone tomorrow during lunch. No, you can't. It includes material that may not be suitable for all ages. (fakes crying): Don't worry. No one's going to hear all the nasty details over the judgmental laughing! You're going down, Tina! (moans) Tina, hurry up. You might be grounded, but you still got to go to school, little lady. Mom, I have a fever. It says you're done if you're a pork loin. Meat thermometer? What, are you new here? Well, let's go, little piggy. Off to school! I can't go to school today. Why? Because. Why? Because Tammy stole my erotic friend fiction. She's gonna read it out loud during lunch today. Everyone's gonna laugh at me and think I'm a freak, especially Jimmy Junior. (crying) Aw... Is that why you've been acting so bad lately? Yeah. She's blackmailing me. Blackmail? No one blackmails our sister but us! Yeah! Messing with Tina is a privilege, not a right. All right, you two, scoot. I need some private time with Tina. Tina... Tammy can't embarrass you. The only one who can embarrass you is you. Yeah? And you're a creative, imaginative girl. You just be you, and Tammy can go sit in syrup. Let the bees get her. What about Jimmy Junior? He's into dancing, right? He probably likes the artsy-fartsy girls like you. Maybe you're right, Mom. Yeah, of course I'm right. I've got nothing to be embarrassed about. No, you do not. I'm going to write the most erotic, graphic, freakiest friend fiction ever. All right! Freaky friend fiction! And I'm gonna read it to the whole school myself. That's the Tina I know! C'mere. ♪ My little baby's back ♪
♪ My teeny Tina. ♪ Louise: Yeah, that's right. Put on that pretty, pretty lipstick, Tammy. Then kiss you ass goodbye with it. Yeah! Unless you lived inside of Mom, you can't mess with Tina. We're Belchers, from the womb to the tomb! We need to get that backpack and steal the journal back from her. Hello. Andy, can I take your backpack on a walk? We'll be back in two minutes. My backpack's gonna miss your backpack. We'll get through this. Sorry, gotta frisk you for weapons. Ugh. You got brownie all over me, jerk. She's clean. (toilet flushes) Ooh, yikes. Try some club soda. Oh, thanks so much. Was I talking to you? (laughing): I guess you weren't. Ha ha ha ha! Sucker. I got the goods. On to the cafeteria to save Tina! And get me another browie! So Tina's rotten friend Tammy threatened to read Tina's private writing in front of the whole school. But we had a talk, and Tina's feeling better, so... What'd you tell her? I told her she's very creative, and not to be embarrassed, no matter what. Well, that's good advice. Yeah. And then Tina had a great idea. She's gonna read her erotic friend fiction out loud to the whole class herself. Tina's gonna read her erotic friend fiction out loud at school? That's a great idea? Huh. When you say it like that, it doesn't sound as good as when I said it with Tina. Right, 'cause she's gonna read... Both: ...erotic friend fiction out loud at school. out loud... Loud... at school. At school! Oh, my God! What have I done? I'll drive. Attention, everybody. It's time for announcements. The first one is from our new student, Tammy Larson. Good afternoon, everybody. (clears throat) I would like to present to you a... What the hell? Cool! Mom packed tampons for lunch! Ooh, share! I have an announcement. It's an erotic friend fiction story that I just wrote. I hope you like it, because you're all in it. It's called "Buttloose." This is even better. Tina! Tina! We got your journal back from your best friend slash enemy. I don't need it anymore. (clears throat) "It was lunch time at Wagstaff." Tina: Touching butts had been banned "by the horrible Headmaster Frond." What? No... no, no, no. "Suddenly, Tina Belcher appeared in the doorway." She knew what she had to do. She grabbed Jimmy Junior's butt, "and changed the world." Okay, Tina, that was a great story. Now let's pass back the mike. "Everyone began to touch each other's butts. "Omar touched Jocelyn's butt. "Chad the Zombie "touched the butt of that girl with the frosted hair from my art class. I think her name is Kristi." It's Katie, and ew. "Even the horrible Headmaster Frond touched Ms. Jacobson's butt." What? (stammering) Tina: "Everyone touched each other's butts, and it was great." All right, come here. Come here, come here. Come here. Come here, come over here. "And then Tammy came up to Tina "and said, 'Sorry for everything.' Okay... "Tina said, "That's okay. Let's go to the movies next week." "The End." Linda: Tina! Don't read your friend fiction! But I just finished it. You're a freak! (laughing) (farts loudly) Ooh. Tammy farted! Oh, my God! My ears can smell it! Laugh fart, laugh fart! Tammy made a blammy! Ha ha ha! Gross! No! It... I didn't do it. It wasn't my butt. (farts) That wasn't me. (farting) No! Oh, ow, ow, ow. That one hurt. That wasn't me! (fading into distance): I didn't do it. (crying, farting) Why are you guys here? I realized maybe reading your friend fiction in front of everyone wasn't the best idea. It turned out okay, I think. No. No. Honey... No, I think it did. No. No, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life. I think people liked it. Man, that girl really farted, huh? Hey, Tina. Was the Jimmy Junior in your story supposed to be me? Oh, uh... it's a really common name. Yeah. It is. Cool story. Thanks. Tina, what was that... Bob? You're a patty daddy? I love cake! Want to cake with me? Oh. You know, I'm really not a fan. A patty cake, a patty cake, a baker's man! Woo! Okay, all right. Work it! That's it. Got it! More! Low! Oh! High! Down! Uh, you guys gotta take this outside. Let's take it outside. Okay, let's go. Hi, see you later. Okay... Having your parents at school. There's nothing more embarrassing than that.
Welcome back to Get On Up with Chuck and Pam. Flu season is right around the corner. So our local beauty expert will be here to show you how to look hot, even if you have a cold. (sultry voice): Ah-choo. Gesundheit. (laughing) Gesundheit. Are they the cutest couple on TV or what, Gene? Yeah, if you like white people. Now look away, Mom. What? Why? Dad's hogging the bathroom so I'm using the guest bathroom! Ugh, Gene. Come on, you've let me do it before! Fine. But move the dishes. (sighs happily) Aw, Gene! That's my spot! That's funny. It smells like my spot. (sniffs) Asparagus! I've been using the toilet like an idiot. Announcer: Are you a fisherman who hates fish? A pediatrician who hates kids? We want to talk to you. Also, want to be part of our new cooking segment? If you're a local chef, send us a tape! (gasps) Oh, my God... B-Bob! Get in here! What? What is it? You gotta make an audition tape to do a cooking segment for Get On Up! Oh, no. I don't... I don't think so. Oh, come on, Bob. You'd be great! No, no, that's... that's not for me. I mean, sure, it'd be fun to be a celebrity chef, but... Whoa. Whoa! Whoa. What? When did a cooking segment turn into being a celebrity chef? That's not what I meant. I meant cooking segment. Forget it. Rachael Ray over here. With bigger hips. Stop it. Go to school. Fine! As long as we're giving orders, put some clothes on! Leave something to the imagination, for God's sakes! Is no one going to comment on my Sasquatch mask? Middle child. Anything for attention. Where'd you get the mask from? No. No. No! Thanks for asking. Peter Pescadero. He said he'd give it to me if I taught him how to pop and lock. Lucy Lock-it lost her Pop-it. Now you. Lucy Lock-it lost her... What kind of a god would give you those legs and no rhythm?! This mask is gonna make me the new "it" kid. As in, "What is it?" "It's that kid in the mask." "Ohh..." Linda: Come on! Let me film you! No. Yes. No. No. Yes. Yes! Fine! Yay! Kids, we're making an audition tape for your father. Hello, Gene. You look intriguing today, son. Why, thank you, Mother! Yeah, yeah, yeah, come on. (growls) Okay, are you ready? Action! (sighs) Okay. So, uh, I am preparing the Onion-tended Consequences burger. Now, first you have to caramelize the onions. And no, I don't mean add caramel. Ha! Heh. Then you add some fresh thyme, which I have right here. Then it's time to add the goat cheese. And voilà¡. (yells) Notice me! Linda: And cut. Got a little weird at the end, but they'll get the idea. Honey, why don't you take that off, huh? Take what off? This is me now! Heard that before. This is me now! This is me now. This is me now! (phone rings) Hello? Yes, he's right here. Bob! Bob! It's Get On Up! Uh, hello. You loved it? Ooh! Really? Ah! Uh, that's great. Oh! Of course I can come in. Ohh! Bring the whole family? Woo! Um, sure. I can cook the... Oh. Okay, bye. (Bob screams) Ah! Ha-ha! Cooking segment! Cooking segment! Cooking segment! Linda: Oh! Whoa. (clears throat) I mean, it's um, you know, it's gonna be good for the restaurant. Yeah. That's the important thing. But we can still jump up and down! Linda: Ahh-ha-ha! We're doing it. Oh, my God. Woo! Yay. Should he be sweating like that? Bob: Ow. Ow. Okay stop. Linda: Oh, my God, this is so exciting! (sing-song): I know. Hi, you must be Bob. I'm Kevin. Let's introduce you to Chuck and Pam. Don't ask them any questions, obviously. And don't touch them, but also don't make too much eye contact. Everybody's friendly... Bob! We just loved your tape. Well, some of us did. Oh, hello. Are you a little bunny? (sniffing) (whispering): I smell fear on you. Okay. I don't like that one. So, Bob, you'll stand over here, and then we'll put Gene here. Huh? What? Chuck: Yeah. Exactly like in the tape. I knew it! I mean, I had no idea, but... yes! No, no, no, no, no. It's great. It's like when they got a chimp on The Today Show. Yeah, that was in the '50s, but sure, let's base all our decisions on that. I think it could go viral! (gasps) I'm gonna have two little stars! Oh, great. Chuck: Well, I don't know about you, Pam, but that is certainly some of the cutest baby panda footage I've ever seen. Oh. So I'll do all the talking and you just nod, all right? Yes. Check. And entertain the crap out of everybody. No, no, no, not that. Okay, just... Blow their minds. Got it. Gene, stop it. Don't do that. I got it. Go, go, go, go, go, go. Okay, and now it is time for our new segment, "Hey, Good Cookin'." And today's chef is Bob of Bob's Burgers. And who is this furry fella? I'm... the Sasquatch Kid! No wait, Burgerfoot! No, Beefsquatch! Right. Um... And today, uh... we're making the Bruschetta Bout it Burger. So we start with some fresh mozzarella, and some basil... Mm, mm, mm. Gene. Stop it. Pop-it-lock-it- pop-it-lock-it. And then we, uh, add some oil and vinegar to these, and... I want beef! Oh. (gobbling) (laughing) Beefsquatch likey like. (laughs) (laughs) (laughs) Ha ha ha! Beefsquatch. (gobbling) Oh, boy. Beefsquatch! So they want Bob and Gene back next week. They said it got the most response of any segment since they showed Pam getting her tubes tied. The fallopians on that woman! Eh... Bob, you excited or what? Bobby? No, Teddy. I'm not. Why not? He's just mad 'cause he thinks Gene Beefsquatched all over his special moment. Don't, Lin. Don't use that as a verb. It's just... it's not what I envisioned, Teddy. 'Cause it was horrible. It was great! I knew this mask was powerful! So, who wants to touch and/or be touched by a famous person? Can I please have my mask back? No! I explicitly said no backsies, Peter. In this country, no backsies means something! Now go pop and lock! But I don't want to do it anymore. Go! Lucy Lock-it lost her Pop-it... (sighs) (Gene whistling) Brush, brush, brush. Bob: Gene. Hmm? I need you to do something for me. It's... It's important. I'm not pulling out your long eyebrow hairs again, Dad. No, it's not... Wait, are they back? Oh, yeah. Yeesh, that is bad. Anyway, I was thinking maybe, um, could you, uh, tone it down out there a little? Like, uh, let me explain the recipe? Try to entertain 'em a little? Sounds crazy, but you got it, Dad. Great. I'll just wait for you to succeed or fail. Thanks. Could go great, could be a disaster... Okay. I got it. Psst. Psst. Hi. Hi. My mom lets me come to all the show tapings, as long as it doesn't interfere with school work. It does. Okay. You're a VIP, right? Did you get to meet Pam? Who, the host lady? Yeah. (moaning) Are you okay? I'm fine. So did you, like, I don't know, taste her hair or anything? No. I didn't think of that. I guess I could have. (moaning) She was swooshing her hair all around. (moaning) I'm gonna turn this way. (moaning) So to make our Mediterr-Ain't- Misbehavin' Burger, we have some feta cheese... Mmm. Mmm. And, uh, of course some eggplant... Hmm. Yum. Uh, actually, these eggplants were freshly laid by the chickenplant this morning. (Bob chuckles) Anyway, so with these... Uh, Pam, why don't you give the audience a chance to get the joke. Chickenplant. (laughs politely) (clears throat) (hums) Oop, I think this one's hatching right now. (hums nervously) I'll save you, boring cook! (laughing) Beefsquatch! (laughs) Okay, okay, that'll be $5. Throw in another five and he'll burp in your face. Wow! Look at all these people that came 'cause of the show, Bobby! Uh-huh. Oh, my God, it's great for the restaurant, just like you wanted! Yeah, it's all just how I wanted it. Mm-hmm. Hey. Nice dish tub. Thanks. You want to go out? Wow, you must really like dish tubs. Are you that boy from the studio audience? Shh-shh-shh. Look, there's something here. We both know it. Let's just take it and run with it. Um... Okay. Could be worse. "Could be worse." (fake laugh) Guess who's gonna get an arm put around them? Me? (both laugh awkwardly) Can I get your autograph? There you go, Toots. Beefsquatch signed it. Oh, my God! I'll sign it. Ow! "Keep sizzling. Bob." There you go. Who are you? Who are you, huh? Old man freak. You idiot kid. Linda: Oh, my God, I can't believe we were invited to Chuck's pool party. (laughs) It'll be swarming with celebrities! Remember, they're just normal people like you and me. Oh, my God, it's local weatherman Scott Bags! Scott! Say "cold front!" Say "cold front!" Linda. Stop it. Cold front! What? He's the weatherman! Last one in the pool is Tina! Ah! Hey... Oh. Hey, hey! You guys made it! Come on, Linda. Let's get tanked! Yeah. Uh, thanks for, uh, inviting us, Chuck. You're in the inner circle, Bob. Think of us as your family now. Okay. So, you and Linda swing? Uh, no. (chuckling): Okay. I'll take that as a yes. Wink. No, I... Steve's wife! You likey? Um. No? Why not? Body? Face? (clears throat) Both. Okay. Hey, Steve, you likey? Um, Chuck... Hey, be open to it. Be open to it. I really don't think this... I thought I told you you were in the inner circle. Right. And the only rule in the inner circle is that you're open to it, so if Steve's in... Oop, Steve's not interested anyway, never mind. We're divorced, you know. What? Mm-hmm. (gasps) Oh, my God, you're divor... I can't believe that. Yeah, we are. You two look so happy on TV. Ugh. What happened? Fame! No. Yes. No. Yes. Fame's great, I thought. Fame tears families apart. No. What? That, and the fact that I refuse to live in a house with low-flush toilets. I deserve the full flush, Linda. Of course you do, honey. Thank you. Yeah. (toilet flushes) Bob: Damn it. (flushes again) Stupid toilet. I'm Bob from Bob's Burgers. Eggplants come from chickenplants. (laughs as Beefsquatch) Hilarious! That's so Bob! Nailed it, Beefsquatch! Hey. Are you making fun of me? No. No, Dad. No. That mask has turned you into a real jerk, Gene! I think you mean megastar. Oh, my God, they're making a scene. You two stop it! No. Let them fight. Everybody look that way. There she goes. (vomiting) Maybe I should just quit. Do it! Leave the entertaining to the pros... meaning me and other people with masks! No, you know what? It's time for you to learn a lesson. Watch your back, Beefsquatch. Why don't you watch it for me? 'Cause I'll be shaking it right in your face! And it'll look like this! Ba-baba- bo-bo-eh-eh... (laughs) It's not funny, Chuck! It's pretty funny! I'm gonna make this show a living nightmare for you. You're gonna wish you'd never been born, meaning I wouldn't be born! What can I get my favorite father-son team? Separate dressing rooms. 

  Separate dressing rooms. And a piñata and large satin pillows. Now! And Greek yogurt. Two-percent for me. Just the plain is fine for both of us! Louise! Psst! Come here! I'm trying to sabotage Beefsquatch and I need your help. Well, first of all, I'm flattered... Shush. Is there anything I can do to throw him off his game? Dynamite in the burger. More subtle. C4. Move off explosives. Habanero peppers. A lot of them. Yes! You're a genius! Oh, stop. Get me habanero peppers! I'll call my guy. Ring, ring. Let me talk to him. That's a fake phone. I don't care. What's your name? I don't speak Spanish. I do. Hola, combre se hombre, habanero pepper. Caw, caw, caw! Caw! I get it. I'm in your dressing room. Oh. Listen, I need you to help me sabotage Dad on the show. What a day! I was thinking, what if I mislabeled Dad's utensils? Write, like, "eggbeater" on the spatula, and "oven" on the cutting board. Hmm? Or what if you put superglue on them? Yes! But can you do it? The last time I used superglue, I accidentally glued my wiener to my remote control helicopter. Ah! Oh! Ah! Oh! Oh, oh...! Accidentally on purpose. Hello, my lady. Hello, my boyfriend Nathan. So, how about we take this to the next level? You wanna make out? Okay, on three. One... Ah... No. I mean, take me backstage to meet Pam. Wait, are you only going out with me to get to Pam? Don't tell me how to love you! Nathan, you might be in this for the wrong reasons. I think we should break up. Fine. Throw away the best thing that's ever happened to you. I don't really think this is the best... But know this! I will taste Pam's hair! And there's nothing you can do to stop me! Let's stay friends. It smells like it's time for our favorite segment... "Hey, Good Cookin'"! So, whatcha got cookin' up today, Bob? Well, Chuck, it's the "I'm Gonna Get You Succotash Burger." (chuckles) That's rich. So I'm just chopping up some tomatoes. Mm-hmm. And then I'm going to, uh... You all right there? Yeah. Mm-hmm. That's funny. I'll hold onto that. Well, why don't we just get the burger on the bun? How 'bout that, Chuck? Okay. Gene! All: Beefsquatch! Beefsquatch! Beefsquatch! Beefsquatch! Beefsquatch! Beefsquatch! Beefsquatch! Well if it isn't Mr. Spatula Knife Hands! Oh, hi, Beefsquatch. Go ahead. Have a burger. Don't mind if I do! (grunts, screaming) (laughing) I put peppers in it! You b*st*rd! I'm gonna get you for this! Bring it on, Beefcrotch! (screams) (screams) (laughter) (spitting): Kitty litter! What a crazy couple weeks, huh? Anyone want to talk about it? I just got out of a serious relationship. Tina, shush. Well, I am doing great! How about you, son? Great here, Dad. Why don't you give me a big hug! Love to. That would be great. (both grunting) Linda: Oh, bullhonk! Pam warned me about this when she was binge-drinking. She said fame destroys families. And this family's going right in the crapper. So that is why... I think you two should quit the show. Tell him to quit. Tell him to quit. Him! Him! Well, I quit! The dirty tricks department is closed! What are you talking about? Nothing. Forget it. Hey, we had some good times, didn't we? Were you helping him? Were you helping him? Jinx. Yeah, I'm out! I'm sick of your dark, twisted games. I'm going to go take a shower. Wash this filth off me. Filthy! Filthy! Look, if you guys aren't gonna quit, then I'm gonna go talk to Chuck and Pam myself! Pam and I are tight! She'll put an end to this. No. What? But what about all that stuff you said about fame destroying relationships? That's just something famous people say. Look, we've struck gold here, and I will be damned if I'm gonna let some mama bear come in here and ruin it! So unless you work for the network or the affiliate or the FCC, I can legally pretend that you don't exist. Well, you're not getting rid of this mama bear so easy! Yes, I am. Security. Hey! Oh, ooh, ooh, ah, ooh! Chuck: Hey, you see those guys over there with the untucked dress shirts? I'll go tuck 'em in. No, no. They hate that. That's the VP and assistant VP of programming. They're talking about a spin-off. A spin-off? Your own show, guys, with me producing. It could be bigger than Get On Up. Well, bigger than Get On Down, which is the midnight rebroadcast of Get On Up. We're gonna be moderately wealthy! I could date someone half my age... five-and-a-half-year-old starlet. Yeah, so it would really seal the deal if you guys would, you know, physically attack each other a little bit. Or a lot. Interesting. Sure. Mm-hmm. Makes perfect sense, right? It's a cooking segment, so, yeah. Great! And physical violence on three. I'm not doing it. One, two, three. Physical violence! Physical violence! Have you seen my mom anywhere? Yeah, I threw her out. But that's funny. I just let you go backstage a second ago. Huh. I wonder where I was going? Nathan: Just let me taste it! Get off of me! Hey, Tina, check out Tina. Nathan! No! No, no, no. What is going on?! Let me go! I don't think that... we can stay friends. Security! Hey, Mom. What the...? Oh, sorry. This is my ex-boyfriend, Nathan. Aw, you two couldn't make it work? No, we couldn't make it work. No. And eight, and nine, and ten... Pam: Oh, wow! Chuck: Looking mazel-tough, Exercise Rabbi. Pam: Call the fire department 'cause my buns are burning! Speaking of buns, I think I can smell some. And it must be time for... "Hey, Good Cookin'"! So, what's cookin', Bob? Well, Chuck, it's the Every Breath You Tikka Masala Burger. (chuckles) We start with a little coconut milk. Mm-hmm. Right? There it is. There's the coconut milk. No one cares. And then, some curry paste... You want me to even pick it up 'cause no one's listening? Whatever, whatever. Just move it along. So, yeah, that's curry paste. Gene: I'm bored up here! Yeah, should I go to the next ingredient or just...? Beefsquatch! Beefsquatch! Beefsquatch! Beefsquatch! More scotch. Beefsquatch! Gene: My ears are burning! Beefsquatch took you down! That's it! Beef fight! Beef fight! Beef fight! Come here, beef boy! (Gene yelling) No matter what, don't stop rolling. (both grunting) Oh, my God! They're gonna k*ll each other! On TV! Are you not entertained?! No... a little. Not you! Oh, stop it! Stop it! Oh, Louise, Tina, Boy-Tina, we gotta get in there! Anyone want to help me throw this through the window? You're a bad, bad boy! It stinks in here! Bob, Gene, look at yourselves! You're father and son! You're supposed to love each other, not k*ll each other. This isn't the Bible! This show has torn my mily apart long enough! It ends now! Kids, cover your ears. FCC, here comes Linda! Dagnabbit, pee popper, nuts to poppa, stinka boob taka, momma kaga, poopa daddy! What was that? I'm cursing on live TV! Uh, those aren't curse words. Not even close. Okay. Well, how 'bout this? No, no! No nudity! No nudity! (screams) Aw, sick! This is to save my family! A-boobity- boobity-boobity-boo! Wow. Whoa! Whoa. DVR! DVR! You said to keep rolling. We're done. We're done. Yeah, by the way, the same thing happened with the chimp on The Today Show. Shut your mouth! You have a smart mouth. You have a smart mouth. Oh, you shut that. Shove it! Wow. Yeah, no kidding. I can't believe she did that... for us. Yeah, milk, saving families. What can't breasts do? Milking the cow! Milking the cow! Listen, I'm sorry, Gene, about everything. I let the whole TV thing go to my head. No, I'm sorry. This thing turned me into a monster! But I'm not a monster! I'm a real boy! Come on, Dad! Solidarity! Oh, God. (chuckles) Gene, you have let yourself go. Bobida-boobida- bop-bop-bop-ba! Ah, okay, well, now, now we stopped rolling. So there's no need for you... Ah, what the hell. Boobity-boobity-ba-bida-ba. Ha-ha! I love you, Dad! I love you, too, son! I love you, Pam! Reporter: And so, facing major fines from the FCC, this long-running talk show may have had its last word. Just a little too (chuckles) titillating. Well, you two may be regular, unfamous schmucks now, but at least this family's back to normal. Amen! You said it! Single and ready to mingle. Yeah. And thanks, Lin, for showing us some perspective. Among other things. Show's over, Teddy. Come on. Sorry, Lin. It's just, ah, you imagine something for so long, and then what you thought was pink is brown, and what you thought was symmetrical is not. It's just unsettling. Teddy, please. Gene, what'd you do with your mask? Did you throw it in a volcano? Nah. I gave it back to Peter Pescadero. I promised him he would pop and lock his way to a better life, and I did not deliver. Another child left behind. Well, it's certainly nice to have the old Gene back. (farting sound) What? I said it's nice to have the old... (farting sound) It's nice... Okay, I'm done talking to you.
Oh! Oh... Uh! What? (gasps) No! Lin, you gotta stop reading the police blotter. It just makes you mad. Why would someone steal the sign for Ball Street? Oh. (laughs) Oh, God, what is this town coming to? It's going to crap. Tell me about it. Somebody threw a snow cone at my windshield today. I thought I hit a rainbow. It was terrifying. Oh, come on. I don't think this town is going to crap. (engines roaring) That's my 2:00. The One Eyed Snakes motorcycle club. Their chapter president died gruesomely. I'm doing the service. That explains why you're wearing leather pants. Been waiting forever to bust these out. He looks like Prince. He looks like fat, white Prince. Mort: Look, but don't touch, fellas. (boy grunting) Oh, no, these are the guys who took over the Steps. I heard they pick on kids. Wait. I'm a kid! Come on. Let's take the long way. I'm not afraid of some high school kids. Watch a-this. (humming nonchalantly) Hey, hey. You can't walk here. Oh, my gosh, I can't walk here? Oh, look, it's a miracle! I'm walking! Shut your butts, coconuts. But you said I couldn't, but I'm doing it. But I want your butt to shut. Oh, listen to the hum of my butt. (humming) Oh, listen to this: clap, clap shut, clap it shut! See ya later! Have a great life! They're just little acne-covered kittens. (mimics gunshots) Meow, meow, meow! (gunshots) Meow! ♪ ♪ This memorial jam has been going on for 21 minutes. I just wonder if I should fade it out. This was Horny Dave's favorite jam. Keep it cranked. Horny Dave's favorite jam? This is my favorite jam. Keep it cranked, Eddie! (bottle breaks) Oh, God, don't come here, no, no, no, no. Welcome! You serve beer? We... do not. What's that? That is beer. Sorry, we do. I lied. Let's drink to Horny Dave. To Horny Dave! What are you talking about? Yeah! (laughs) Um, the woman who won that drinking contest, she's pregnant, right? Well, they say in moderation. Hey, man, they don't judge your lifestyle, you buttoned-down pencil pusher. What? Sorry, Bobby, this motorcycle thing's contagious. I kinda want to go out and get a bike tonight. Hassle shopkeepers. "Hey, old man!" You know? "You don't know me. I'll break your window and hit ya with a bat." Sounds like a great idea, Teddy. Ah, maybe not. Probably just watch a hockey game. To Horny Dave! A helluva man! A helluva friend! A helluva lover! Uh, they broke more bottles. Whoa, looks like our restaurant just got a lot edgier. Hope I can still get in. You probably can't. I'll meet you guys after. I like your lid. I like your vest... what's left of it. Yep, these colors have been to hell and back. Part of 'em stayed in hell. What are those pretty buttons? Oh, these patches? Well, we got this one for... tickling a cop. Cool! What's that one for? For not being associated with the white power movement. And what's that one for? For blowing up a bunch... of balloons... for kids like you. Just an ordinary day here at Bob's Burgers, right, kids? Nice place. I'm Critter, by the way. Uh, Bob. Yeah, I'm the, uh, chapter president of these fellas. Horny Dave was, till his grisly d*ath. Well, I'm sure you don't want to talk about it, so... Yeah, he got into a wreck with a semi, all right. Real fiery. Mm-hmm. By the time they pulled him out, his entire lower half, the horny half, was roasted. That's why Horny Dave's vest here is in tatters. Um, it looks nice. No, it doesn't, Bob. No, it doesn't. This vest is supposed to make me look like the unquestioned leader of this club, but instead I, I just look foolish. Mm. Whoa! Statch! Nasty Slim! Cool it! See? Horny Dave was just a better leader. If we were fighting, he'd come out and he'd say, "Let's go cook some meth!" And we would, and we'd forget all our troubles. That sounds nice. Maybe we should cook meth. I wanna forget my troubles. God bless this meth. Kids, go inside. So, uh, that's your old lady, huh? Uh, yeah. She goes by "Linda." Or Dragon. Whichever. So is that your old lady? No, Mudflap was Horny Dave's. She's a special woman. She can open a beer with her boobs. Mine can't do that. It's an art. Tina: Whoa! Ha-ha! Bob: Oh, my! Mm-hmm. Thank you. Thank you. Now I want them. Is that a requirement for being in the club? Wish it was that easy. Initiation was tough. Mudflap beat the snot out of some poser in Macon, Georgia one fine day in spring. Got her colors that night. It was fall. It was spring. I remember because the azaleas were in bloom. Ooh, azaleas. Oh, the azaleas are beautiful in Macon. Second only to their crank. That sweet Macon crank. Oh. What's crank? Like meth's dirty cousin. Oh, we're gonna cook meth. Oh... ha-ha. Okay, time for bed, sweeties. Come on. Can I bring a biker with me to tell me stories? No, you may not. Please...? Just one! No. All right, everybody. We drank the place dry. Let's ride! Biker: Come on, lil' sweetheart. Jump on back. I'm sure they have designated drivers, so... This should cover the damage. Sorry there's blood on some of it. Huh. Oh... Oh, one last thing. Here. What's this? Means we owe you one. Put it in your window. Nobody will mess with you. Uh, except maybe the Buzzard Kings. They might throw a Molotov cocktail in here. You call me if they do. Uh! No, no. Right in the window. So, we've got this now. Gene: Uh-oh, we're crossing paths again. We're crossing paths! Hey, remember when I told you not to come around here? Guess not. I'm not so good with history. Me, neither! I'm pretty good at history, but I have some problems with math. Well, I'm taking a course in the future. You know what happens in the future? We walk right past you. Uh! I just want no little kids around me when I'm decompressing after school. I'm trying to create a relaxed environment, I'm making my friends feel comfortable, and then you come by with all ts attitude! Hey, you don't want to mess with my sister. She'll wear down your self-esteem over a period of years. Mm-hmm. Shut up, four-eyes. Oh. I'm talkin' to four-ears. With four ears, I can ignore you twice as hard. What, what? What, what? You've pushed me to the point of break. I'm confiscating these. (Louise screams) (both gasp) Laters! What just friggin' happened?! So, I couldn't help notice someone doesn't have their bunny ears on. Ha-ha! I know, right? It's, uh, been a pretty long time since we've seen you without your... Too long! Too... long! Okay. Louise, maybe you'd feel better if you told Mom and Dad... How happy I am? Mom, up high. Hey! Oh! I'll take one. You got it, bro! Whoo! Whew. Oh. Geez. Do you think I should go talk to her, Bobby? No, you shouldn't! I'm great! Just fantastic! (door slams) Uh, maybe wait. (school bell rings) You're not wearing your ears today. Or are they invisible? Ha-ha-ha! Invisible?! Where do you come up with this stuff? Your mind is so beautiful! Yeah, take it in! Whoa, Louise, not wearing your bunny ears? This is big. Lots of issues to discuss, feelings to process. Oh, yeah, tell me about it, Mr. Frond! I am processing up a storm, but I could really use a processing-partner! Me?! Great idea! Your office? Five minutes? Yeah! I'm out of here. I'm gonna wait for that punk at the Steps and get my ears back. We'll come with you. No. You guys go home and lie to Mom and Dad. Good. I'm a liar, not a fighter. Louise, wait. What? You want us to keep your dinner warm? Yeah. Real warm. Hello, I see you're wearing my ears. Oh, they're off-center a smidge. Let me just... (shrieks) Nice try, kid. Fine. We're all young professionals here. I'm Louise, by the way. I-I don't think I got your name. Logan. Logan... what's this in my pocket? Oh, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine dollars for the hat. You can't buy me like a cheap s*x lady! (yells) (chuckles) Too slow, down low. Why don't you go back to plan-school because looks like you need a better one. Why don't you go to plan-school?! Why don't you? Why don't you? No, you, why don't you? Why don't you?! No, why don't you? Why don't you?! What do we do with this card? Take it down? It's creepy. Are you crazy? Remember when you took down that charity jar? You saw how pissed those breast cancer people got. Hey, parentals. Where's Louise? Um... Hat shopping? Shopping for hats. Huh, that makes sense. I guess Louise needs to transition from bunny ears to something. Like training wheels. Like when we got a fish for Gene to prove he was responsible enough to get a dog. I was not. That poor fish. So, where are we going? My calendar is wide open. Yeah, well, uh, I'm home now. So, run along, little doggie. No, we're home now. Until I get those ears back, wherever you go, I go. Going to school, Logan? I'll join you. Let's do it. (yells) Nope. Logan, Logan, Logan, Logan. What do you do? You go to your locker before you go to class or you go to class? Gotta pee? What's the routine here? You know, I could pee... in the boys' room. Well, you think I won't go in there? I'm not giving up, Logan. I will wear you down. I got a prom date because of these ears. My practice S.A.T. scores went up. I'm not giving up, either. Whoo! It stinks in here. Welcome to boys' smell. Logan! I like your bunny ears. Thanks, Shanaya. Louise: They're not his ears! (yells) Oh, sorry you had to leave so soon! Let the record show that I tried to reason with you, Logan! Now I have to go nuclear! Can I help you? I hope I'm not interrupting dinner, ma'am, but your son... (sighs) he stole something of mine. Logan! You took this girl's bunny ears? I didn't want to tattle, but you left me no choice. Yeah. I took 'em. Return them. Now. I threw 'em away. I told you you'd never get 'em back. Bull, you threw them away. Search my room. Ugh, Logan. Sorry, I'll write you a check. $20? 0 seems a bit high, honey. Oh, God, Tom. Not now! Where did you throw them away? Pancho's Tacos. Which one, Logan? It's a chain! The good one. The one on Riverside. Uh, kid, what you're looking for was incinerated. It's gone. Pfft. Burned up. Sorry. No! (sobbing) 

  (laughing crazily) Revenge. Is this it? No! Are these it? It's pink with ears. Oh, then they're gone. It's a hat. No. Then they're gone. Hey, I remember this hat. It was gonna be my thing. Remember? I could pull this off. Right? Um... yeah, of course you can! There she is, my little big girl. Tina and Gene told us you were in the market for an in-between hat, so we dug some out of the closet. Maybe not this one. You probably don't want this one. How thoughtful of you all, but I don't need a hat to complete me. I'm all I need. Just me. That's what I keep telling you. Good night, Linda. Thank you for thinking about me. You're welcome. All I need is that hat! Mine! Logan: Look who it is. Surprised you don't have pig ears on, the way you squeal. (laughs) Ha! Ha! Ha! Question. How's your hearing? Uh, pretty good. Why? Well, then I guess you can hear that. (motorcycles rumbling) That's the sound of revenge. Uh... For taking that which wasn't yours, I have summoned the wrath of the One Eyed Snakes! Hell hath no fury like... k*ll the bikes for a second! Thank you. Hell hath no fury... Did you hear that part? About hell? Yeah, I think so. Good. 'Cause the rest of it is, "Hell hath no fury like I do, Logan!" You took my ears and threw them away. And now these guys are going to take your ears and throw them away. What? Oh, boy. I'm going to watch through my fingers. No, I'm not. I'm going to look away. I think we're gonna have to lay low for a little while after this. Oh, God, don't cut my ears off! Ha! Ho! I hate when shirt tags stick out. Here, here, here, here! I never threw them out, okay? (crying): I'm so sorry! M-My ears. Please don't cut off my ears! Leave 'em where they are. They... they look good in that position. Can I look yet? Nee-ya... I'll let you know. My hands smell like onions. It's nice. Don't ever mess with us again, Logan. Now, get the hell outta here! Ah! Yeah! That's how you do it! That's how you do it! (motorcycle rumbles) No, no, no, no, we just got the place back together. (engines rumbling, bikers laughing, talking) Welcome back, fellas. How are you? Linda: Kids? What's going on? Louise, you're wearing your ears again. Yeah, some kids stole 'em and these mamma-jammas got 'em back! Mamma-jammas, what? Your ears were stolen? Yup. I cashed in the card the One Eyed Snakes gave us. Good to see you again, Bob. Nice hat. Ah, really? Yeah, you think so? Oh, and I told them food and drinks are on the house. No. They... that's... No. I don't think that's... Ya hear that, boys? Go crazy! All right! Yay! No. No. No, no, no. All right, let's go crazy. Please don't go crazy. (talking, laughing) Um, can I help you folks? Yes. We are parents in this community, and we're marching on your filthy, dangerous biker bar. We're not a biker bar. You are serving beer to a ton of bikers. Tom, please. This biker bar is the reason our town is going down the tubes. And we will not allow violence against our children to continue. Violence! Violence? What violence? Those bikers wanted to cut off my ears. Oh, God. Ah, calm down, we weren't gonna cut off any ears. Don't listen to him. He would have. No, I wouldn't. Yeah, you would. I'm tellin' ya, I would not... I think you would have. You don't know my mind! You see, I was just teachin' these little bullies a lesson. So this is the brat who picked on my Louise, huh? Let me tell you something, Miss Priss. Lin... No. I got this. These bikers aren't the problem in this town; it's your kids. They're a bunch of animals. Yeah, lady! Control your kids. Oh, it is your kids who cannot be controlled. She's right. I'm out of control. Oh, why don't you go fart in a phone booth! (making fart noises) All right, Lin, calm down. You tell this hussy to calm down. Yeah, calm it, hussy! Do not call my wife a whore. Oh, I will not calm it. (grunts) Biker: Love a catfight. Ah! Ooh. (grunting) Lin, stop... Ah! Don't do this... Ooh... Pull out her highlights, Mom. All right, all right, everybody just calm down. Ah! (gasping, murmuring) Pick that up, apologize and leave. Please. For your own good. I will do no such thing. Shoulda left when you coulda left. Everyone who's got a knife, grab it! It's a fight to the d*ath! (murmuring) Hey, hey, you can't fight these people, Critter. You'll... you'll destroy them. When somebody messes with the One Eyed Snake's colors, they gotta pay. My leadership's on the line. I got no choice... we gotta hurt these people. Would Horny Dave have his men beat up some white collar parents? Horny Dave is dead. All right, it's goin' on now, here it goes. They're just bluffing. The One Eyed Snakes don't bluff. Neither do the Belcher kids! Except when we do. Yeah! Let's keep shouting stuff! Screw inside voices! Okay, I'm calling the police. Tom: No! My running mix! Oh, enough talk. Let's kick... (groans) Mudflap, are you okay? I'm fine, it was just a contraction. Let's... (groans) Contraction? You're in labor? Hold that kid in till we're done! I'll try. (groaning): No, I can't. This baby's coming. Oh, this baby's coming. I'll call an ambulance. I'm a doctor. Well, then get the hell over here! All right. Get under the hood and check the oil, Doc. (groans) Okay. Okay, okay. Uh, how far apart are the contractions? They are not. Oh! Wow. Okay. This baby is coming now. Like right into my hand. Hang in there, Mudflap, hang in there. Don't forget to breathe. Do you want me to get you a wooden spoon to bite on? Oh, forget the spoon. Get me whiskey. Um, I'm not sure whiskey is... I have a flask in my golf bag. Yeah, I got one here, somewhere... I got some whip-its. Here. Take mine. Hold on a sec. Okay, you're doing great. Uh, what's your name? Mudflap. Oh, Mudflap, uh... that was my grandmother's name. Really? No, no. You're named after a dirty part of a truck. Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay, keep breathing. Okay. And... ready... push! Ugh. Just pretend it's lasagna. (Mudflap groans) I don't know how Mudflap's doing this without an epidura If I didn't have one with Logan? Whoo! Ugh, tell me about it. Those two? Piece of cake. That one? A whole cake. I'm sorry my Logan picked on your kids. Hey. I'm sorry my kids had bikers threaten to cut your kid's ears off. I need you guys to hold up her knees, just like this... Okay. I see the head. (Mudflap groans) Oh, I looked. That's a head. I hope that's a head. I shouldn't have looked. I looked. One more big push, Mudflap! Okay! (groans) Here it comes! (groans) (baby crying) All: Aw. Critter: Look at that. "Not it" to clean the table. It's a boy. Barely. Mudflap, is there someone you'd like to cut the cord? His daddy. But Horny Dave's dead. No, Critter, Horny Dave had a vasectomy in '95. Come here. What are you saying, woman? This baby's yours. I still don't understand. Critter, we had s*x and you knocked me up... Slow down! Slow down! This baby is your spawn. Oh... Wait a minute, what do you mean? (sniffs) You're a daddy. From when? Sometimes the one you slept with nine months ago was right in front of you all along. Oh, Mudflap. Give me that cord. (people exclaiming) Okay, are we gonna have the fight now? Or... Louise, there's gonna be no fight. This little kid squashed a beef better than Horny Dave ever did. My boy. How 'bout that? Here, Creature. Critter. Right. Maybe you could use it as a baby blanket. Oh. Thank you. And thanks for getting your hands dirty, Doc. No problem. Aw. Parents helping bikers who are now parents. See, our town has its problems. But it doesn't mean it's going in the crapper. It just means if we want to be a better neighborhood, we have to be better neighbors to each other. Boo! Boo! Stinks! Okay, Louise, come on. Thanks a lot. It's okay. You were very brave. You stood up for yourself, got help from dangerous bikers, all without your ears. Maybe you don't need them anymore. Maybe. And maybe I know someone who needs them more than me Look, these ears mean a lot to you, Logan, so how about you keep 'em? Really? No friggin' way! I was just messing with you, you idiot! Ah! Oh! Welcome home, ears. Let's get you a beer. Dad, two beers. No. They're for my ears!
So, Bobby, I can't wait to see you and Linda at my Halloween party tonight. I went all out this year. Uh, actually, I'm taking the kids trick or treating tonight, Teddy. So, I probably can't make it. Oh. I noticed here that you, uh, RSVP'd online and you clicked "maybe." Right. Uh, that was kind of a soft maybe. Maybe means maybe, Bob. It doesn't mean "I'm too scared to say no." Uh, uh... I got 42 maybes, Bob! Who can plan for that? (door opens) Linda: There's my little candy corns. Ooh. Sad Wolverine. Scary and sad. I'm Edward Scissor Hands, Mom. Uh, I'm not sure about you walking around with scissors all night, Louise. Why don't you be Edward Spoon Hands? Get real. It's Halloween. Not Hallowuss. And Tina's a mummy. Sexy. Last year I was a mummy. This year I'm a mommy mummy. And I'm single and I'm working two jobs, and I'm just trying to get back out there. Tina, you have to put your costume back on the roll tomorrow. I'm not losing that much TP. Okay. (clears throat) Oh, and Gene looks great, too. Wait, what are you, hon? I'm rapper/actress Queen Latifah from her U.N.I.T.Y. phase. Oh, God, so specific and political. I love it. Mm-hmm. All right, kids, help me close up shop and we can all go trick or treating. Dad, we've decided that this year and in between we trick or treat alone. But you kids love trick or treating with me. That's the best part. Yeah, that's the best part (falsetto): Yeah, that's the best part. Shush, shush. I, I don't know. I mean, it's, it's Halloween. You know, things can get a little weird out there. Oh, just let 'em go, Bobby. C'mon. (sighs) Fine. You can trick or treat by yourselves this year. (cheering) But you stick to o regular route and I want you home by 9:00. Ugh. Hooray! You can come to my party. Oh, right, great. Yay! I wa this to be the sugar high I never come down from. (Gene screams) Okay, bad start. Bad start. Let's keep moving. All: Trick or treat. Uh, here's some oyster crackers. Now get out of here. All: Trick or treat. Is it Halloween? Here, uh, take some deli numbe. You'll be the first in line tomorrow. (knocking) All: Trick or treat. Some delicious seaweed candy from my solo vacation in Singapore. Wrap it up, Charles Dickens. You're not being paid by the word. ♪ I was walking in the graveya... ♪ Bobby. Linda. Oh! Hi, Teddy. Welcome to my Black and Orange party. Teddy, you really went all out. I spray-painted everything this morning. Yeah, it's uh, aittle strong. Maybe we should open a window or something. Yeah, I would, but they're painted shut. Can I offer you a hard-boiled egg? I colored them black and orange with a marker. (high pitched squeak) Whoa. Whoa. Hey. Ooh. What was that? Ooh. No need to be scared, everybody. Just my guinea pig, Francis. You can call her Frankie. But just don't call her Fran. She hates that. What about Francy pants? Saint Francis pants, huh? What's wrong with you? What? Hey, you're not wearing a costume, Bob. I just didn't think I needed to wear a costume. It's not a kids' party. Hey, everybody, we've got (rings bell) a party violation over here. What are you doing? Bob is not wearing a costume. Mike the mailman's not wearing a costume. Mike's a bunny. He's not a bunny. I'm a bunny. You have a cotton ball. He has a cotton ball. On your uniform. It's a great idea. Now we're gonna get you to the costume closet. ♪ Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba ♪ We got some sort of Chewbacca. No. The sun. No. Summer Frankenstein. That's not a thing. And, uh, oh... I think we got a winner here. No, no, no. There, all better. Now, you don't look so ridiculous. I'll trade you two packets of hot sauce for a fortune cookie. Throw in some cough drops and you got a deal. Sold. This town is horrible at Halloween. We're trick or treating by ourselves for the first time ever; we need to get some real candy. Follow me. I know where we can go. We're going where the rich people live. Rich people are better at Halloween. And skin care. That's why we're going to... Kingshead lsland. Ooh. Ooh. Aah, I should have worn more toilet paper. Okay, uh, okay I admit it's a little colder than I thought it would be. Aah, I don't wanna die. I'm not wearing my good underpants and I'd be so embarrassed. (all sigh) Did it just get ten degrees warmer? I think that seagull just winked at me. Hello. Kingshead lsland, nice to meet ya. Now, I trick or treat ya. Tina: Wow, look how clean it is. I could drink from the puddles. I'm going to. Hey, guys. Sweet 'tumes. Costumes. Edward Scissor Hands, cool. Queen Latifah, also cool. Finally, somebody gets it. Toilet paper roll. Nailed it. Mummy. Hey, I'm Milo. I'm Ned. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, is that all candy? Yeah, we already dropped one bag off at home. Now, we're gonna head down Spencer Street. That's where all the good houses are. Funny coincidence. We were also gonna go down Spencer Street. Well, great. I'm gonna eat like a Queen. Come on, Lin, Teddy went to the bathroom. Now's our chance. Let's sneak out of here. But you look so cute. I wanna spank the cake right out of your face. Uh, no. Come on. Teddy: Aah! Oh, my God, oh, my God. Somebody stepped on Francis. Oh, my God, oh, my God. She's not breathing. She's not breathing. Live, damn it, live. Teddy, let me try. I have good lungs. (inhales deeply) (coughing) Somebody do something. Mike, do something. What do you want me to do? I'm a mailman. Aah, Mike's a mailman! Oh, God. Come on, move those legs, Francis. Move those legs. Oh, I saw it. I saw it move. Move those... She's alive. Come on. Oh, no, she's dead. No, she's dead. Somebody stepped on Francis. And then did nothing. Nothing! Teddy, how do you know someone stepped on her? Guinea pigs aren't flat, they don't just look like this in the wild. All right, well, uh, we're gonna go. Uh, Lin, get your stuff. Yup, yup, yup. Great party. Seriously, I hope that, uh, Francis comes... is... gets better. Oh, no, you don't. What? What? Nobody's leaving. The k*ller is inside this room. No one leaves until I find him or her. Sorry I'm late. Whoa, who died? (doorbell rings) All: Trick or treat. Oh, you kids look great. Here ya go, one for you. Here ya are. Oh, Africa. Hey, is Bill puking in my bidet again? Full bars? Full bars? Full bars! She just gave us full-sized chocolate bars. Does she know? Oh, my God, was it an accident?! What just happened? How does this not topple your economy? Everything I knew to be true just went out the window. The Wagners are on vacation in St. Bart's. You know what, good for them. Those Wagners were looking run-down. Please, take one. What happens when you take two? Aah, it got me. Help! Oh, wait a minute. Nothing happens. I'll take three. Thanks, Wagner family. Have fun at church or whatever St. Bart's is. Ah, it's got my hand. Just kidding. It was funnier when Louise did it. Ma'am, I'm speaking now. I let you speak. Now let me speak. You don't tell me when to call 911. The police aren't coming. Looks like I have to do this investigation myself. Teddy, I really don't think anyone at your party purposely k*lled Francis. Every man is capable of m*rder if he's pushed far enough. Mm-hmm. Even you, Bob. You've been stewing in the corner all night. What are you talking about, Teddy? You can get a little testy, Bob. Don't buy him a V-neck T-shirt, whatever you do. He goes berserk. You're not in the clear either, Linda. You couldn't share the spotlight with Francis, could you? You had to stomp her out. Don't accuse me, Teddy. You're the spouse. It's always the spouse. Passion of m-m-murder passion. Teddy, you're going crazy. I mean, you're kind of ruining your own party. Or did Dennis ruin my party? By k*ll*ing Francis. I didn't k*ll your freaking rat. Maybe you didn't, Dennis. But I know you get dirty massages. Whoa. And let's not forget about Mike the Mailman. Me? What about me? It's your walk. Your menacing walk. Slamming your feet all over town. Left, right, k*ll, k*ll. It's a limp, Teddy. You know Mike has uneven legs. It's why I wear my special shoes. Don't you mean m*rder weapons? Yeah, you know what? I actually wanna see everyone's potential m*rder weapons. Yeah, shoes in the chip bowl, now. Aww, those were good chips. Yeah, they were, Linda! They were good chips! Milo: Okay, guys. It's getting pretty late. Better get off the streets, huh? We're pushing it a little. Uh, don't you think? Yeah. What do you mean? We're just getting started. There's a whole other street here full of sugar just waiting to course through our veins. (whispering): Hell Hunt. (whispering): What does that mean? Yeah, why did you just whisper "Hell Hunt?" You guys don't know about Hell Hunt? You're not from Kingshead Island, are you? We come from the mainland: America. Every Halloween, after all the parents get drunk, the teenagers come out and they go freaking crazy. They ride around town on their bikes, vandalize stuff, and if any little kids are still out, I heard they, uh... I heard they, uh... I heard they, uh... They, uh... Say it. I heard they shave your head. I heard they throw balloons full of pee. Three years ago my brother's friend stayed out too late and he came home covered in syrup without any eyebrows. Yeah, I don't know about all this. That's a lot of different stories. I like syrup. Look, it's not safe. We've got to get indoors. And you guys need to get to the dock. Cool tip, Milo. Come on, guys. Let's go get some more candy. Huh, what was that? Huh? What? Did you hear that? No. (teenagers laugh) Hell Hunt! Hide! Boy: Oh, kids, come out and play. (laughs) (howls) (laughing) Hey, Wade Boggs, do you like eggs? How do you like these eggs?! Ow! I don't like 'em! Please don't cry. Please don't cry. Ah, quick question. Does anyone here know how to get back to the ferry? (brakes squeaking) Oh, ah, hey, Amanda! Hey, Bryce. What's up? Oh, not much. Just, uh, hanging out with my... budsies. I remember when I was a sophomore. Hell Hunt's so lame. Yeah. I mean, it's like... (laughs) grow up, right? I guess it's cool you guys are keeping up the tradition, though. Oh, totally. Yeah, Hell Hunt's the best. So are you. (clears throat) What? Um, that's your car that you're driving? That's your car that you drive? This guy is dying out there. He just needs to be himself. Oh, no. He should pretend to be someone else. What the freak was that? What? I-I thought I heard something. I got 20-20 hearing. Anyway, you should cruise by my lacrosse game. No thanks! Bye! Bye. There's one! Geesh! Aah! Goosh! Ow! Let's go. Where are we? I think it's a country club. It's like a huge miniature golf course. The windmills are gonna be enormous. Look. I see a light. Maybe that's the docks! (bird squeaks) 

  (crickets chirping) Tennis courts? I don't think those kids are playing tennis. Or they're playing it very wrong. (squeaking) Ah, they all kind of fit. Like she got stomped a couple of times. Can I have my shoes back now? I'm the only one here with uneven legs. Quit milking that leg, Wobbles. Whoa, that's not funny, Teddy. It's okay. It's my last name. Fine, you can have your left one back! Thank you. Maybe we should ask Francis who k*lled her? Are you mocking me, Gretchen? No. I'm a medium, Teddy. I can talk to dead animals. Mort, your toupee says hi. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Good joke! She's pretending I wear a toupee. So funny. Okay, we're leaving now. Maybe I can still catch up with the kids. But Gretchen's onto something. (silly vocalizing) Lin, she's just drunk. Let's go before she asks us for a ride home. Bobby! Psst. Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! What? What is it? You have fur on the back of your costume, Bob. What? And tiny little scratch marks. Oh, God! Oh, God. I ki... (whispers): ...k*lled Francis. (groans) (squeaking) Psst! Milo?! I'm so glad you guys are here. They're gonna pee-balloon us any minute now. Oh, yeah, we're glad we're here, too. So, uhyeah, you know what? Oh, this just came to mind. How do you get to the ferry? Oh, ah, okay, just follow this road down the hill and turn right at the stop sign. Now help us break out of here! Lizard: There's kids loose! Let's get 'em! Run! (laughing) You're in trouble! Get it?! Louise: Yes! You can't outrun number one! Louise: Yes, we can! (panting) Three, please. Let's get off this godforsaken island and back to the armpit we call home. I can't wait to be back in my own house, in my own pajamas, in my own Dutch oven. So long, island! (screaming in distance) Oh, those kids are really getting it. I remember Hell Hunt. Still can't stand the sight of eggs. Won't eat 'em, won't touch 'em. What about a nice egg salad? No more egg talk! Yes, more egg talk! Man: Aah. Eggs! Let's go, Gene! Tina, come on! But Milo and Ned are back there, and they need us. (pained screaming) Do they, though? Tina, this isn't our fight! Do you really want to stay here and get pee-ballooned? Yeah. I can pee on myself. I don't need any handouts. Listen, this town gave us the best candy we've ever seen. We owe it to them to go back. Great. Now my candy tastes like guilt! Aah! Fine! We'll go back and save Milo and what's-his-face, but I get to slap Gene. That's fair. (yells) Aah! I banish you from the land of Latifah! Okay, so all we have to do is sneak up to the tennis courts, take out the guy guarding the gate, fight off four teenagers and free the kids. I zoned out. Say that again. We just need some kind of distraction. (tires squeak, phone ringing) I'll be right there. I'm just stopping to get gum and some t-pons. Distraction located. All right, who wants the first pee balloon? You? No. You? No. And... send. (phone beeping) (phone beeps on) Hell, yeah. I just got a text from Amanda. "Pool party at the Wagner house with me and the girls!" What? That's awesome! Ugh. It's kind of cold to go pool hopping. (phone beeping) "The Wagner's pool is not cold." That's weird. Okay, let's go! What about Hell Hunt? Are you crazy? These girls are seniors. I heard Amanda's got a belly button ring. Well, I heard she can tie a cherry stem with her butt! I heard she has to special order her bras! This thing is like a remote control. They'll do whatever I say. Tell them to push their butts together. Give them French accents. She says hurry. And that we're really cute when we hurry. Hey, get all your farts out now before we get there. (whirring) (crickets chirping) Help! Help! Let us out of here! (grunting) Help! Queen Latifah, give me strength! (groaning) (metallic creaking) Thanks, guys. Oh, oh, thank you. I'm not a big fan of pee, right, Ned? Well, we've got a boat to catch. Hold on. I'm not done with this yet. These teens messed with the wrong kids... us. (phone beeping) "Sorry we are late. "We are getting our boobs ready. "You boyz go skinny-dipping. C U soon to skinny-dip." All right, let's pop off our pants. There's a lot of carrots in that stew. (whoops) This is awesome! We're skinny-dipping! It's gonna be even better with girls, I bet! Okay, let's get to the ferry. This candy's not gonna eat itself. We should steal their clothes and throw them in the ocean. Or we could take pictures of them, and then later, we can look at them. That would show them! Fine, I'm gonna get started. Chocolate, caramel, lollipop, hot sauce. Yes! That's it! Let's put hot sauce in their underwear! Does that even do anything? Yeah, if there's one thing a wiener hates, it's hot sauce. I learned that the hard way. Mmm. Taco on the toilet. Why doesn't everybody do this? (screaming) 11 years old and still learning every day. ♪ And that's amazing grace. ♪ Who would like to pay tribute to Francis? Mike? Every time I delivered mail to Teddy, Francis greeted me with a friendly... ♪ Wee, wee, wee-wee, wee, boop-doop-doop. ♪ Something like that. What do I do? Teddy's gonna k*ll me for k*ll*ing Francis. You got to tell him. A guinea pig. What is it? Anyway, I'm Dennis. Thank you guys. That was beautiful. Bob, do you want to say anything? Yes. Uh, Francis was a great animal. She went through her life with such poise... I can't do this. Teddy, I k*lled Francis. What?! I-I didn't even know I did it! I couldn't feel her underneath this stupid fat suit that you made me wear! Oh. Oh. (squeaking) Oh! Oh, God. Damn it. (squeaking) You could have been summer Frankenstein. Summer Frankenstein wasn't good enough for you. I'm really sorry, Teddy. She gave me the best 14 years of my life. Wait. She was 14 years old? How long do they usually live? I don't know. Three to five years. Uh, she was a 154 in guinea pig years. Uh, you probably shouldn't have painted her black and orange, man. Yeah, she got real dizzy. She kept trying to eat her paw. Wait. Why would you spray-paint your guinea pig, Teddy? For the party, 'cause it went with everything. I know... Lin, I know that. But why, Teddy, would you do that? It's pretty stupid. I got caught up in the party. Okay, Bob. We both k*lled her. Fair enough. Well, now I can get a ferret. Anyway, thanks for coming, everybody. Sorry I called you all murderers. If anyone wants me to burn them a copy of this Spooky Sounds CD, just let me know. They're not coming. I'm getting pruney. Let's get out of here. Chill out with your dills out, man. Don't be lame. I'll call her. (phone ringing through) What the...? (phone ringing) Hey! Bye! (panting) I should have just taken one! Those full bars are weighing me down! (yells) No! Louise? How many pairs of underwear did you hot sauce? Only one of them... wore underwear! Huh. Huh. (yelling) Oh, you are dead! My baby! Come here! (grunting and groaning) Our pee! Ew! And so, the hell hunters become... the ones who are being hell-huntered. Well put. Thanks, guys. Mess 'em up! Bye, Milo. Bye, Milo's friend. We'll probably come back next Halloween. No, we won't! Yes! No! Ooh. Gross. Have you guys seen my phone? Geesh! Uh, actually some kid... Ow! I'm getting hit with... Ugh, forget it. Bye! Boy: Yes! Yes! Ooh, so close! Ugh! No fair. I lost all my full bars. You can lick my wrappers. Or I can eat your wrappers! Nothing will ever replace my baby, but these full bars are coming pretty close. There's my little cavities! Yeah, how was your first Halloween without me? Pretty boring, I bet. Uh... Um... Your father k*lled a guinea pig! He squashed it with... Lin! Oh, tell us about that! Was it in self-defense? Did he disrespect your woman? No. I just... rolled on to him. Yay! Yay! Oh, yeah! Here's what happened. Mm-hmm. It was a dark and spooky night. I knew it!
Gene, what are you doing? Tanning! It's the middle of summer and I look like a British lady. Hey, slow it down, George Hamilton. You want to look like an Oompa Loompa? Gene, if you want a tan, why don't you go out in the burger suit for a while and hand out samples? No way. I don't want burger lines. (door opens) MAN: Package for Bob Belcher. Dad, that's you! Thanks, Gene. A mystery package! What could it be? Huh, the return address is my dad's old restaurant. That's weird. There's a note. It's from those ladies who bought your dad's place. "Dear Bob, the workmen found this box when they were redoing the air vents. We were afraid it had vibrators in it. Boy, were we relieved." If you think about it, any box could have vibrators in it. Oh, my God, it's my toys! Wow, I haven't seen these since I was just a kid. I used to hide it from my dad because he didn't want me to have toys during work hours. Joke's on you, Dad. Someone filled your toy box with trash. What? No. This is my friend Brilly. A scouring pad? A scouring pal. And my World War II fighter plane. And my dog, Mr. Doglavich. That's soap. Yeah, but see? It's sort of shaped like a dog. Mm... What is this feeling I'm feeling right now? It's like I'm sad for another person? Is that a thing? Am I going crazy?! Look, times were different when I was growing up. We had to make our own fun. Here, try these. You'll see. Ow. See? Now I get it. If anything, this is too fun. I want to pet the dog! No, Mr. Doglavich! Sorry, Dad. He's dead. You could take him to the soap vet. No, I can't, Tina! We're going to bury him out back. Everybody get your coats. Bob, stop it now. No! It's summer! That's my dog! He's dead! Go take a time-out. I'm gonna write a eulogy. I knew you so briefly, you dead soap dog. Oh! I think I can fix him. There you go, good as new. Who's a good boy? Woof-woof! Fetch, Mr. Doglavich. Man: Get back to work, Bob. (mimics machine g*n) Die! Get back to work, Bob. (bicycle bell ringing) (kids laughing) (model plane trilling) (dog barking) Get back to work, Bobby. Oh, my God. Lin, I just realized something. I had a bad childhood. Yeah, I know. What do you mean you know? Look at you. What do you mean, look at me? Look at how you stand. People who had good childhoods don't stand like that. I thought I remembered having fun working at my dad's place, but I was just working... all the time. And snuggling with steel wool. And petting a piece of soap. (sighs) I guess talking about it helps. (snoring) (humming "Bridal Chorus") (both grunting) (groans) Kids, get back to work. (echoing): Get back to work... Oh, my God! Linda! Kids, your mother and I have an announcement. Buh, buh-buh-buh, buh-baa! You're having another baby? At your age?! Sick! I knew I spotted a bump. What?! No, I'm gassy. No, guys. Okay, here it goes. Kids... you're fired. Buh, buh-buh-ba! Ex-squeeze me? You're all fired. I deserve this. I've been coasting. This isn't punishment, it's, it's a gift. My dad made me work all the time. And that box of toys... Horrible toys. Yes, horrible toys, made me realize that I never had any fun. So, I want you to go out and have the summer and the childhood that I never had. So go out! Go outside! Go be children! But what are we supposed to do? Have a water balloon fight. Play in a vacant lot. Ride bikes. I'm more of an indoor boy. I can't defend myself, I've been declawed. Gene... All right, well, I guess we're gonna take off. Arrivedercis. Bye, Mom and Dad. Keep in touch. Don't change. See you in the fall. Tina, you can come home at night. Ah, phew. I'm glad you kids store your bikes in my garage. It's fun for me. Sometimes I pretend I have three kids of my own and these are their bikes. Which kid is your favorite? Jeremy. He needs me the most. The twins have each other. Whoa. Sometimes I come in here just so I can trip over 'em. I'll be, like, (growls) "The kids left their bikes here again." All right! Summer fun starts now! (grunts) Oh. ♪ Fun, fun... fun-fun ♪
♪ Fun, fun... fun-fun ♪
♪ Fun-fun-fun, fun-fun-fun ♪
♪ Fun-fun-fun, fun-fun-fun, fun-fun-fun! ♪ Ah! Diapers! So, how would you feel about, um... how do I say this?... uh, deferred payments? I wouldn't pay you now, but... eventually I would, in the future. What I'm gonna ask you isn't totally legal. It's not a s*x thing, though, so... Okay, I guess I'll keep these resumés on file. Maybe we can get an unpaid intern. Ooh, they could do coffee runs! Lin, we have coffee here. I don't care. No one's ever gotten me coffee! Everybody on the floor! This is a stickup! (both gasp) (laughs) Mickey! Ah, you're out of the slammer. Bob, Linda. bring it in. Aw... Hey... how's my favorite hostage? I thought you got eight years. You didn't escape, did you? It turned out the prosecutor was on meth for the entire trial! (gasps) And he drove his car into a peacock sanctuary. Now he's in jail and I'm out! Oh, good for you. I'll get you a beer A beer'd be nice. Hey, where are those whippersnappers of yours, huh? Uh, I fired them. What? No! That sounds harsh. We laid them off to go enjoy themselves. Ah, yeah, sure, breaking windows, lightin' fires, huffin' paint, Um... sniffin' glue, blowin' up houses, settin' rats in a bottle and throwin' 'em down a river and... No, none of those things. So, what's next for you, Mickey? What're you gonna do? Goin' straight, Bob! Gonna get a job. Find myself a gal. Or... I don't know what people do nowadays. Build a-a barn maybe. Um... Paint the barn with the gal. Put the gal in the barn and... Yeah, maybe. You know, American dream. Gal and a barn. Yeah. Hey, Bobby, psst. What psst? We can both hear you, Lin. What about ickey-May for the ob-jay? I'm pretty sure he can understand you, Lin. What language is that? Oh. Uh... wow. Well, Mickey, if you're serious about finding a job, we-we need someone for the summer. Oh. We can't pay you that much, honey. Not even what we're legally supposed to. I'd work for meals and a cot in the basement. Um... I guess you could sleep in the basement. (laughs) Oh, yay! Oh, I love it! We got the team back together again, huh? Oh! The three amagos. Olé! Ugh! Summer is awful. There's too much pressure to enjoy yourself. It's like New Year's Eve for kids. We should probably go by the restaurant. I bet that place is falling apart without us by now. Well, we've sown our wild oats. Things got crazy! Anyways, no need to grovel, Dad. We're back. We all said things we didn't mean. You said: "You're fired." You did not mean that. It sounded very insincere as I remember, and I thought, "No." (pots clattering) Oh, my God, is someone here? Um... Uh... Hey, baby Bobs! Kids, you remember Mickey. You fired us for a bank robber? Hey! Look, Mickey, we're back now, so you can turn in your apron. Louise, no. You guys are just our kids now, not our employees. Is that all we are to you, Dad? Your children?! Yes, and I want you to go have fun. Never! Stop fighting it and give it a chance! You can't make us leave. (all grunting) Hell no, I won't go! Hell no, I won't go! Uh! why are you guys stronger than me? Pilates! This is for your own good! Fine! We'll ride our bikes. Oh, yeah, we'll ride 'em so far you'll never see us again! Okay, bye, kids. Have fun. Bye, Mom. Guys, I think we're lost. I know. And all this breathing is making me hungry. Blueberry bushes! We're saved! Is this a farm? I thought those were extinct. We can't just eat these berries. They probably belong to someone. If you don't want people to eat your fruit, grow it inside a safe. I don't know how animals do it. Fruit is just bad, and they know it. Hello, children! (shrieks) Farmers! How did those get in there? Don't worry, we've got plenty of berries. Eat as many as you want. Or if you'd rather have sandwiches, we have plenty at the house. And lizards. I'll eat both. ...and then I woke up nude on horseback in the forest, and there she was, my Beverly. I had wandered away from a community birthing in a barn nearby. She looked like a faerie queene pooping under a tree. ♪ A faerie queene pooping under a tree. ♪ 30 years and five kids later, and we're still doing it. Gene: Ew... Well, we've got an empty nest now, but we still have our farm. Our dad has a restaurant. We used to work there, but he fired us. Oh, now, that's a shame. We always let our kids work here. Beverly, I have a crazy idea. ♪ They could work here... ♪
♪ Work here. ♪ We couldn't afford to pay you much. Just, say, ten dollars a day. Ten dollars?! I could start saving for my Porsche Cayenne. But Dad doesn't want us to work. Dad doesn't have to know. Are we gonna send him a letter? You gonna call him up? No. You gonna find a phone and call Dad and tell him stuff? No. Seems like Dad told us to just make our way, didn't he? Well, I guess I don't want any gaps in my resumé. That's right. You don't. Good, because we've got a lot you could do. Yes, they could pick the weed... s. Great idea, Bev. We have a terrible weed problem. (both giggling) (chuckles) (chuckles) (chuckles) I don't get it! Morning, kids! Can I get you anything? I'll just have your coffee. Give it back. I'll just have a sip. Louise! No time, Louise. We're late. Late for what? Late to... for our... (clears throat) What would we be late for? It's not like we have jobs or anything. 'Cause we're late for the pier. Yeah, we gotta go to the pier. Yeah, the pier. To do our pier, our rock stuff. What's rock stuff? What do you mean...? Oh, droppin' rocks... Yeah. ...in the water. Sounds fun. Yeah. Yeah. I can disorient a fish. Nice. Well, as long as you kids are having fun. Oh, yeah. Ah. Summer rocks are the best rocks. Boy, we should go. Well, drop one for me. (chicken squawking) I want your nuggets! (Gene grunting) You two little critters will be our pickers. Now come with me. Gene has tons of experience picking his nose. And my butt. Tina, you'll be our blueberry delivery girl. Just remember, if you get jammed up, you don't know my name and you don't know where this farm is. I don't know where this farm is. Exactly. Mickey: Ta-da! Wow, Mickey, you handed out the whole tray of samples already? Sure did, Bob. And, ah, you don't mind the burger suit? I love it. I love it. I know who I am in this. I'm the burger. Right. Sorry, it's a little tight. But, yeah. It is. It's incredibly snug. It looks fine. It's good. I'm gonna need your help taking this off, I think. If that's all right? Oh, uh, yeah, sure. I'll, uh, try and pull the... No, you see, there's snaps in the crotch that my arms aren't long enough to get down to. If you could just... this and that. Yeah, I don't want to touch down there, so... Well, I need you to, 'cause that's what I can't reach. If you could root in there real quick and just pop 'em out. Um... ugh. Let me just, ah... get in there. Yeah, oh, okay, it's hairy, yup. Mickey: Ah, there you go. Thanks, man. Whoa, Mickey. You're not wearing any underwear. Do not wear underwear in prison. Someone could choke you with it. Well, why don't you leave the burger suit on then, huh? All right. Hey, Mickey's a pretty good worker, huh? Yeah. He's the helpful, enthusiastic employee we've never had. I wish he'd wear underwear though. Yeah, hold the pickle, ha-ha! And that's how you pick the weeds! Which ones are the weeds? They all are. Why are the weeds inside? So that they aren't outside, messing up the blueberries. Why don't you just set this whole greenhouse on fire? Be done with it. Oh, we're going to, one dime at a time.

Let's keep it that way. Ooh, blueberries. I'm ready for a bake-off. (groaning sound) Tina? Oh, it's just the refrigerator. Hey, fridge. You sure sounded like Tina a second ago. Wonder what she's doing right now. And I wonder what Gene's doing. Probably farting. (Mickey laughing) 

  (laughing) What's so funny? The burger of the day, Bob. I just noticed it. The "Beets Me Burger." (laughing) That's brilliant. It works on so many levels. Well, it's not that good. I mean... Louise would come up with a better one than that. Like, she would write, like, "Dia-beets-es Burger, comes with insulin." Oh... that's in poor taste, huh? Sure, but that's what makes it fun... That doesn't sound fun. It sounds hurtful. That's a really terrible disease. Well, I know it is... My grandmother had that disease. Well, I'm sorry. B.B. King has that disease. Shut up, Mickey. Sorry, but just hush. Ten dollars in my pocket, Gene got bitten by a lizard, we're living the dream, guys. I just wish Mom and Dad worked at the farm with us. Yeah, I miss making fun of Dad's B.O. I'm too scared to make fun of Cooper and Beverly's smell. I think there's something seriously wrong with them. Hey blueberry girl, do you have any extra blueberries on you? No. And don't ever come here again, you hear me? My parents don't know I deliver blueberries, get it? Okay, whatever. No. Do you get it? Don't... come... here... again. Okay, bye. That was a close one. People love fruit! I will never understand it. It's not that good. (calypso music playing) Bob. Hmm? Mickey's playing his calypso again. Can you say somethin'? You go.

I was fixing that. Fixing it with a pick? Yes. Mickey? All right, look, Bob. Don't tell anybody, but I'm digging my way to the bank. What? Come on, no. It's the perfect crime. I've got double jeopardy! What do you mean you have double jeopardy? I'm robbing the same bank, Bob. They can't try me for it again. Yes, they can, Mickey. Look, remember how you held me hostage? Of course I do, silly. That's how we met. And there were SWAT teams, and helicopters, and negotiators? Yeah, it was great, right? It wasn't great, Mickey. That's the only time in my whole life I ever want to have SWAT guys pointing g*ns at my face. Just that one time. Never again. Got it? So, are you cool with me finishing my tunnel? No. You may not tunnel through my basement to a bank. I forbid it! Fine, then, Bob, why don't you fire me? Okay, you're fired. You're firing me?! Look, you can stay tonight, but tomorrow you're gonna have to find another place. Okay. That's cool. I'm taking the pick. No! Oh, Bob. I tell you. Uh-huh. It's gonna be really tough to find a job within 50 feet of the bank that will also let me sleep in the basement. Hmm. Well, I'm sure there's something. Oh, I'm so clumsy. Better clean that up, Mickey. Actually, I fired Mickey. And good news, I'm hiring you all back full time, starting right now. So you can clean it up! Uh... sorry, Dad, but we can't do that. Look, I know what I said before about wanting you to have fun, but the thing is, my childhood was terrible because I actually had to work, and my dad never smiled or laughed. Yeah, mine neither. And he had a drinking problem. Oh, been there, man. Open up some fresh wounds here, Bob. All right, Mickey, enough. All right. (clears throat) I spent last night thinking about this, and I'm a pretty good dad. Yeah, Mom's the one with the drinking problem. The problem is I don't have a friggin' drink in my hand! (laughing) The point is, you guys don't have a hard life, you know? You just goof around. And you should be goofing around here at home, with us. Dad, we've moved on. We got other jobs. What?! We're working girls now! You're a girl? Yes. Nah. Yes. He's not. He's not. No. Tell that to my v*g1n*! You got other jobs? What do you mean, you got other jobs? What about the restaurant? Oh, that's adorable, Dad. You thought that you could snap your fancy dad fingers and we'd come crawling back. You thought if you didn't want us, nobody else would? Well, guess what, Cooper and Beverly wanted us! Who's Cooper and Beverly? Cooper and Beverly? They're farmers. And they smell great, so don't even bother asking. They still have farms? Where do they have farms? Way out in the country where a man can breathe the air. Sorry, Dad. I hope we can still be friends. Wait. Wait. What are they paying you? I'll match it. Ten dollars a day. Never mind. Have a good day. Bye, guys! Hey, is that blueberry delivery girl with the glasses here? You mean Tina? She's not here. Well, I need to return these blueberries. Can you tell her they were mostly stems and seeds? I want a replacement or my 40 bucks back. Okay, I'll let her know. Okay, bye. Bye. That was weird. Wow, 40 bucks? Those are expensive blueberries. They're probably organic. (sniffing) Oh, they smell like a music festival. (sniffs) Huh, you're right. Bob: Oh, my God, Lin. Are the kids working on a pot farm? (gasps): Ooh. Oh, yeah, the old false-bottom blueberry box. I remember these from when I was a kid. We have to go get the kids. But we have no idea where this pot farm is. I may have some idea of exactly where it is. Mickey: No, wait, go back, go back, go back, go back. Wow, this isn't what I pictured. It's nice. Hey, I've been there, buddy. Remember, they can't cage this. What are you doing on our property? We want our kids. What kids? There are no kids here. Tina: Hi, Dad. Oh, hey... Hello. Oh, you mean our kids. Your kids? Those are our kids! Come on, guys. Get in the car. Now. Let's go. Mom, Dad, we already explained this. We work here now. Okay? You're acting a little desperado. No, Louise, you no longer work here.

(ship's horn blows) Bob: Okay, kids, you know the plan. When the ship docks, Gene: bam, bullhorn! Abandon ship! For Bob's Burgers. Then, Tina, when people start coming ashore: pow, coupons! 50% off to all cruise ship passengers. Pow. Try "poo." That always gets attention. Oh, yeah, yeah. No. Poo. Use the bullhorn. No. Poo. (laughs) Never mind. Just don't say anything. Yeah, don't say anything. Where is everybody? Did you hand out the coupons? Yes. Oh, wait. No! What happened? We practiced! We choked, Dad! We planned on handing them out, but then it was noon, and then there was a bug that landed on the ground, and anyway, the day just got away from us. Oh, God... Rooty-toot-toot, someone's wearin' a white suit! I think that's the captain, Lin. White pants, take a chance. Permission to come aboard? Permission given! I'm Captain Flarty. Is this restaurant seaman friendly? You know, I've tried burgers from Maine to Mexico, but this is the best burger I've ever had, Bob. Um, thank you. Maybe you could encourage your passengers to try our burgers. I'll do you one better. Join me as a guest chef on our cruise to Puerto Rico. Really? Ooh... Your family will accompany you, of course. Ten days, all expenses paid. (cackling) Wow, that's, that's quite an offer... Uh... but we really can't afford to leave this place for that long. Kids: Come on! Hmph! Also, I'm, I'm supposed to get a meat delivery, and the pickle guy's coming, too, and... You're turning me down? Yeah. Sorry? Um... Well, then, would you at least do me the honor (coughs) of cooking just for tonight, Bob, at the captain's table while we're docked? Say yes, say yes, say yes! Um... sure. Uh, yes. Yay! Well, it's something. We'll take it. Outstanding! And meanwhile, your family will have, of course, free run of the ship, and I, I do mean free. Take this VIP card, bride of Bob. Ooh... Women and children first. ♪ And VIPs! ♪ Everyone, listen! This ship is...! (muffled yelling) Fancy? Was he gonna say fancy? Sexy? Pregnant? A grand old dame? Don't tell us! Let it be a surprise!

Uh, thank you, Captain. This is our first time on... Aah! Kiki likes you! Go on. Oh, don't be afraid, pet him, pet him. Uh, no, thanks. What is, what is... what is he? I want you to pet him. He's a capybara. Aren't you a capybara? It's the largest member of the rodent family... After Gene. Mm-hmm. (Kiki grunting) Oh, God. Oh, Kiki! That's a big BM, yes. All right, dinner's at six bells. My first mate here, Mr. Asch, will show you to the galley. And you'll show the captain's table how burgers are done. All right, Bobby, have fun cooking! Yeah. Come on, kids. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I want to see how far Kiki gets with Dad's leg. Yeah...! Bob, this is our head chef, Duval. (grunts) If you'll excuse me, duty calls. My replacement. I hope that you have a hairnet for your face and arms. I'm not replacing you. I'm just cooking one meal for one night for the captain's table. You remind me of me, back when I was the captain's special guest chef for just "one night," 56 voyages ago! (dramatic tone plays) Ah, there's the dinner rolls. Why does your timer sound like that? It's French! (dramatic tone plays) Okay, over there is the movie theater, and beyond that is the rock-climbing wall. A talking manatee?! I don't know what that is, but I got to see it! All right. Us girls are gonna go hit the spa. Pass. I'm gonna go write dirty words on sunbathers' backs in sunscreen. Yeah, I'd rather not spend all day in a... (moans) I can go to the spa. Look at you, making hamburgers with your fancy beef for the fancy captain's table, Mr. Squishy-Squashy. Mm-hmm. The regular passengers will be enjoying my fresh vegetable stew. Um, none of those vegetables are fresh. The passengers don't care. They only complain if we run out. And when they complain, the captain gets angry. Is he a little crazy? (hushed): Shh! He can hear you. He put a microphone in the cheese grater. Act normal. (humming) Come on. Hum, hum. Okay. Uh... (humming) That's it. Humming like normal. Okay. Announcer: He's a former regional Star Search finalist... she's the sexiest sea cow on the ocean. Together they're Herman and Marilyn! Why were you out so late last night, Marilyn? Listen to this one. Always up my butt. ♪ Ooh-ooh-ooh, sexy lady, ocean lady. ♪ This is so much safer than the sun. Come on, cook me. (bed buzzes) I can't work on minors. Ship's regulations. I could lose my job. Marco, what if I told you I'm holding a life-threatening amount of tension in my glutes? No glutes. Calves? No. Haunches? No. Muffin top? Back fat? No. Top of head only. Deal. (moans) Don't stop. (moans) Francesca, I don't want to be here, you don't want to be here. So let's make the best of it. Can you do this? Ooh! Cancel the rest of my appointments. Nailed it! Why don't you jump into the ocean and see me sometime? (all laugh) What's your name, handsome? No, it's Gene. Hi, Gene. Hygiene. Something this one could use a little more of. Well, at least my jokes are fresh. Jokes? What jokes? You're the straight man. I use the term loosely. Well, you know loose. I prefer to be called "flexible." My pants feel funny! Good-bye! I need a summer drink to go with my new summer glow! Hey, Isaac, daiquiri me! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah. Who wants apps? I'll take 'em all! Hi, Gene. My scalp massage was fantastic. Thanks for asking. How was the puppet show? Weird. I felt like I had to pee the whole time, but I didn't. Whoo, throw a ripped wedding dress on this daiquiri 'cause it is not a virgin! Go ahead and give yourself a big tip on goldie. And this is my son. You can't tell 'cause he's pale and I'm so dark, but take care of him, all right? Looks like the boy who's sweet on you has a silver spoon sticking out of his mouth. Mm-hmm. I think we just found our meal ticket. Duval, you're sweating into your stew. Eh, saves on salt. Oh, God. I'm glad I'm leaving after this meal. It's like a hundred degrees in here. Oh, sorry. I was hogging the fan. Okay. That doesn't work. Thanks. Cool off. Thank you. Cool off. Take it away. Here you are. Ouch. It's on my face. Ah-ah. Ah-ah. Ah-ah. Come on, lady. Let her play it. You've had plenty. (sniffs) Ugh! Oysters? Yes, they're for the brunch tomorrow. Duval, these oysters are spoiled. You're spoiled. Okay. I don't know why I thought you'd be interested in that, but, uh, don't serve those. I am serving them. Don't serve those. I'm serving them. Captain would like to thank the chef. Oh! I meant Bob. Oh. Huh? Hmm. Psst. Urgent whisper. Meet me later. Cabin 308. (coughs) Me? No, the other handsome young man I'm whispering to. I wish I could, but we're leaving after dessert. Well, if you're looking for something sweet... Who are you whispering to?! Him? Oh, leave him alone. You leave him alone. I think you've embarrassed yourself enough for one night! Remember, cabin 308! Honored guests, let's give a big Windbreaker salute to guest chef Bob Belcher! Linda: That's my man! He made your burgers and he made my babies! Ugh. Okay, kids, come on, time to go... Are we moving? Bob Belcher, everyone. Where's the land? Where's the land? Where's the land?! Next stop, Puerto Rico. What?! Looks like you'll be my private chef after all. No, you can't do... Linda, we're being shanghaied! Shanghaied? Ooh! Ancient Chinese vacation! Yay! Yahoo! Boobies! What? Nothing. (whimpers) All right, steady as she goes, Bob. I wouldn't call a ten-day, all-expense-paid cruise "being shanghaied." But you can't force my family to be on this crazy boat for ten days. Oh, come on, Bobby. It's a vacation. You deserve it. We all do. Stop fighting it. This isn't a vacation, Linda, it's a kidnapping. This is a slave ship. You're disoriented, Bob. It happens to some people when they're at sea. You'll adjust once you let yourself relax. Yeah, Bob. Give in. We're not missing anything at home. Hey, Bob, it's Demetri. I'm gonna leave your meat outside. Uh, you and Linda are probably upstairs. Back in five minutes, right, buddy? Ooh-ooh-ah-ah! (chuckles) All right. Let's discuss your concerns on the bridge, Bob, where there's s a ship-t-shore radio you're free to use. You can call someone and make arrangements. All right. All right, good man. (quietly): I'm gonna let him steer the boat. That always works. You'll get your vacation. Kids, looks like we're on this Puerto Rican cruise for the whole enchilada. So, now I can go to room 308. What's in room 308? I don't know! I wonder if Marco has a 9:00 scalp shiatsu. I'll massage your scalp, Tina. Ow, ow, ow. So, how does this work? The coast guard sends a boat for us or... Wait, this isn't the bridge. Mm-hmm. This is the galley. And your home for the next ten days. You're out of your mind. Yes... with hunger. Now get cooking, 'cause I've got room for another burger. And oh! Oh, it looks like Kiki does, too. (grunting) Let him finish! Yes, sir. (panting) Go ahead, Bob. Go ahead, run! Unless you can run on water, there's nowhere for you to go! Damn it, you're right! (laughs) Who's crazy now, Bob? You still are! Ah...! Bob. (over P.A.): Attention crew, this is your captain. Our mustachioed guest chef has gone missing. First one to find him gets their passport back. All right, let's see what these babies can do. (grunts) No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Francesca! Hey, Marco. I'm four hours older. Maybe you can rub my neck now? (whispering): Don't tire him out. Do you have penny slots? Yes, we do. Give me a whole roll of pennies 'cause I feel lucky. Marilyn (sing-songy): Who is it? (hushed): It's Gene. I can't talk long, he's in the shower. I got you this mug. I hope you "heart" cruising. Thank you. Uh! (shatters) Herman: Marilyn, who are you talking to? Uh, room service! He's jealous. He never lets me out of his sight. I just need 100 bucks for new headshots, then I can go solo. But where, oh, where will I get $100?! Well, maybe you... Oh, Gene, thank you! It'll just be a loan, I promise. Here's your first interest payment. Marilyn, you never wipe the seat! There's sea water everywhere! (gasps) Run, my little cabbage! Run to $100! (ship's horn blows in distance) Yes! Help! SOS! We've been kidnapped! Man (on bullhorn): Sorry, please repeat! (disco plays) We've been kidnapped! My family's on this boat! (music stops) Is everything okay or is there a problem? (disco plays) Th-The captain is crazy! Help us! (music stops) All I hear is a funky bass line. (disco plays) I know, because he's doing it! Stop turning the music on! Ha-ha! Very funny! Screw you! (music stops, plays) 

  What's the matter, Bob, you don't like high energy dance music?! k*ller whale, k*ller whale, k*ller whale! Orca! Whoo-ha-ha! Yeah! Uh, Bobby? Bobby? Have you kids seen your father? You mean that creepy guy with the mustache? Yeah. No. Hey, we're trying to sleep in here. Sorry. Penny angel! Feels good. Oh, feels good on my face! Pennies, pennies, pennies. Mom, we talked about this. Pennies, pennies, pennies. Mom, stop. Pennies, pennies, pennies. You're better than this. Pennies, pennies, pennies. Flarty (over P.A.): Come out, come out, wherever you are. (giggles) You made one mistake, Flarty: you let me live. Passengers, join us tomorrow morning for Poseidon's Brunch, featuring Chef Duval's famous Oysters Onassis. Kiki loves them, and you will, too. Oh, crap. The oysters. Row, row, row the boat... Duval? Hmm? Is that you in there? No one's in this pot. Go away. I am the spaghetti. Duval, you're not the spaghetti. I am spaghetti. Let go of the lid. Just spaghetti in here. Val, stop. I'm trying to get off the ship, all right? But first you have to throw out those oysters. If I don't serve the oysters, Flarty will make me teach pole-dancing to seniors. But if you serve them, people can get really sick. It's like the Hippocratic Oath of chefs, Duval, to not make people sick on purpose. Bob... Yes? ...kiss me. What? You know you want to. No, I don't. You didn't just want to kiss me just now? I didn't. All right. But you're right. Come, let's throw out those horrible oysters right now, Bob! Now you're talking. You first. Way in the back. What the hell?! Duval, open the door! You spend the night in there. The captain is complicated, but he knows what's best. (banging on door) Duval! Duval! I will kiss you. Too late. The moment's gone, Bob. Duval! We can do more than kiss! Other things! Duval! (banging) (Bob grunting) Thanks for serving canned meat, Duval. (grunting) Flarty (on P.A.): Good morning, Windbreakers! Looking forward to seeing you all at Poseidon's Brunch, featuring Oysters Onassis, as well as the catch of the day. (laughs) That one is a little shout-out for you-know-who. (horn blares) (squishing sound) Hmm? He's gone! Oh, damn it! You get the brunch ready! You! You find Bob! When he runs, it only makes me want him more, right, Kiki? Kiki-Kiki-Kiki. Little help! (air hissing) Oh, sorry. Bob: Louise, come here. Over here. Oh, hey, Dad. Flarty is absolutely insane. He locked me in his walk-in overnight. He's gonna serve rotten oysters. We've got to stop him. Oh, Dad, watch this. Clackety-clackety- clackety-clackety, click-click-click- click-clack. Huh? Louise, are you gonna help me or not? Okay, I'll help. All right, good. First, we need to distract Flarty and his crew while I take the oysters from the brunch. Well, I am a master of distraction. Ow! See? (panting) I'm gonna get you that hundred bucks, baby. (grunts) No! Those are for Marilyn! Ah! No! Drop it! We have personnel on every deck looking for Bob, sir. (yells) (gasps) Ha-ha! I got your rat! My Kiki! Clackety-clackety-clackety- clackety... Get her! Clackety-clackety-clackety- clackety... So long, seamen! Clackety-clackety... Where are you taking the oysters? Trust me, you don't want these. There's plenty of other things to eat. Don't tell me what to eat! Let go. I'm trying to help. Yeah, help yourself. Argh! They must be running out! Clackety-clackety-clackety- clackety... I did it! I did the distraction! Typically, Louise, when you do a distraction, you don't lead everybody to me, right? Right! Okay, next time. How dare you use Kiki in your sadistic game? My sadistic game? That's right, buster. You kidnapped us. Thank you again. I'm having a wonderful time, Captain. Linda, are you kidding?! Wha...? He shouldn't be captain. Anyone would be a better captain than you. Sounds to me what's happening here is a mutiny! Ooh, mutiny? This boat has so many activities! Go ahead, Bob. You want a mutiny? Proceed. Okay. Come on. All right. Let's go. I will. Go ahead. (clears throat) Here we go. Everybody... Here we go. All right, let me... Call a mutiny. I'm doing it! All right. But if you fail, I'm putting you in a dinghy with nothing but a compass and a biscuit. Okay, fine. So who's with me?! How about you, shorts-and-binoculars guy? You hate it here. Or you, prisoner guy. I saw you locked in that room, right? You've got to be on my side. Don't look away! Oh, Dad. Oh, you're bombing. Oh, forget it! Get the dinghy! Captain, there seems to be a problem with the buffet. (vomiting sounds) Oh, boy. Uh, yup. Ooh, I love this song. (jazz playing) Marilyn?! Marilyn...! Ugh! Marilyn, are you okay?! I found your eye, but I couldn't get the money. But I will. Kid, forget it. It's just a scam! What? Oh, God. Listen, you're a sweet kid, (gags) and you deserve better than an old, (gags) an old sea cow like me. But, but... Save your buts. Some things just aren't meant to be. Keep the eye. He's got a whole box of them somewhere. Ah... What the hell was that about? I know she was a puppet, but she put her hand right up my heart. Aw, sick! Don't worry, Gene. There's plenty of manatees in the sea. But there's not, really, because they're endangered. (humming) Mon dieu! Now can we go to some land? These people need a hospital. Give it up, Bob. Your mutiny failed. Duval, make Bob a doggie bag for his dinghy. No, Captain. I'm sorry. Did you say no? Yes, I did. I gave you the best cooking years of my life. And now on behalf of all cooks and all oysters, I demand that you give up your command. There you go, Duval! There you go, Bob! You're relieved of your position, cook. Asch, remove Bob and Duval from the dining room. Asch! Asch! Duval is right, sir. I'm with him. I've cleaned up enough of your messes! Escort the captain to his stateroom. All right, you're doing great. Kiss me! Not now. Not a good time. Then when?! French kiss that Frenchman. Well, you've won, Bob. But remember this... What'd he say? Nothing. He just burped. Ah... (a la Marilyn): I miss you, Gene. I really, really miss you. Anyone need a mole removed? Ah, peel my back. Look, Marilyn, it's a meat farm. It's beautiful. Ugh! You've got to be kidding me. I'm going to bed, I'm not dealing with this right now. Or maybe ever. Well, I've never felt more rested. Like a protein sunset. It's nice.
Faster, faster, you beast! This is as fast as it goes, Gene. It has a messed-up wheel. And a lot of junk in the trunk. More to push. Yes, Gene. You love it. Beep-beep! Here we are in Turkey Town. Oh, hello there. Which one of you lucky fellas wants to get eaten by me this Thursday? (in goofy voices): Me! No, me! Okay, settle down everyone. So Dad's talking to turkeys now? Sheesh, Dad. Get an oven. Your dad loves Thanksgiving. It's his favorite holiday. Will it be you? You're a big one. You been working out? (in goofy voice): A little. Well, you look great. Yeah, it's a little weird, but it's his selection process. It's like The Bachelor, but at the end, the one he chooses gets eaten. That's what happens on the real Bachelor, too. They just don't show it on camera. (in goofy voice): Hey Bob, what about me? Oh, yeah. Sorry, I didn't see you there. I hope he waits to get it home before he stuffs it. Yes... Yes, it's you. (gasps, in goofy voice): Really? Really. (in goofy voice): Hey, thank you so much. I don't know what to say. It's okay, don't say anything. (in goofy voice): Oh, Bob. Dad, are you crying? Shh! Let them have their moment. Yes! Come on. Let's go get stuffing. Come on. You're the one! Come on! You are the one! Gene: That turkey is our mom now. (door bells jangling) Uh, Mr. Fischoeder. Um, it's not December yet. And I, I paid November's rent a few days ago. I know I used a lot of pennies, but... Stand down, Bob. I'm just here as a friend. A friend who needs to borrow your family for Thanksgiving. What? I need to borrow your family for Thanksgiving dinner. Why? Bob, have you ever been in love? I-I guess. I-I technically am. Hi! Well, Bob, I was in love once, too. Oh, sick! With Shelby Schnabel, the most famous sharpsh**ter since Annie Oakley. You lost me at "love" but brought me back with "sharpsh**ter." She left me for a married oil magnate. Then she left him for a married movie magnate. She's a magnate magnet. More like a homewrecker. Exactly, which is why I need to give her a home to wreck. If you want to wreck your home, buy a bunch of mice, like a normal person. So, Bob, in exchange for one month's rent, can your family pretend to be my family? Yay! Acting! Mmm... no. From now on, call me Gene Fischoeder. No wait, Vesuvio Fischoeder. No, wait, Alabama Slammer! I'll need you, too, Bob, to pose as my cook and to roast the bird. Definitely not. Thanksgiving is this family's favorite holiday. Eh. Wait, it's not? No way. Check the rankings. It goes: my birthday, Christmas, Halloween... Easter... Hanukkah... Snow Day, Amateur Night... Uh, okay, that's... Veterans Day... Tooth Fairy Eve... Not real. Patrick's Day, May Day, Groundhog Day, season premiere of Game of Thrones... You've never even seen... Opposite Day, Day of the Dead... Stop. Dawn of the Dead, Carnivale... Angela Lansbury's birthday... No. Bath Night... (Bob groans) Black Friday, then Thanksgiving. Love Black Friday. Black Friday before Thanksgiving? Yeah, 'cause it's dark. Oh, come on guys, what about all of our Thanksgiving traditions? Gene and I always play football. Always go for the feet. Ow! Tina and I break the wishbone. I wished for more wishbones. And Louise, we use the giblets to play Turkey Crime Scene Investigation: Miami. (shutter clicks) Cause of d*ath is a missing head. Same as last year. Same as every year. We've got a serial k*ller on our hands! But everyone's favorite part is my funny toast, right? Like, last year, I said, if you want to open the door to this family, use the tur-key! (chuckling): Tur... Oh, my gosh. I just got it. Let's up the ante. Three months rent. (gasps) Bobby. Two. Gene, no. Purple. What are we guessing? Five. Deal. Wow, I didn't think you were gonna go... Okay. Uh... well, that'll make a huge difference for us. That's-that's like real money. Goodie. I'll send you all scripts for Thursday. I want you to really get into your parts. Just like I'm going to get into Shelby's parts. Her lady parts. Which are the lady parts? The v*g1n* and the heart. (grunts) I can't believe my bridesmaid's dress from Ginger's wedding still fits me. You look like an elegant sausage. I hope I can breathe to do my Thanksgiving song. I thought we settled on no song. I hate plays that don't have songs. I'll find a place to fit it in. What's your Thanksgiving song? Uh, no, no, no, no, no. ♪ Pass the cranberry sauce ♪
♪ We're having mashed potatoes ♪
♪ Ooh, the turkey looks great Lin... ♪
♪ Thank you for loving me Lin. ♪
♪ Thank you for being there ♪ Oh, God. ♪ Everyone's thankin' Lin. ♪
♪ The whole world's thankin' you ♪ Stop, Lin. Stop. ♪ Thankin' us for thankin' you Lin. ♪
♪ k*ll the turkey. ♪ Please. I liked it. Thank you. Okay, everyone, we're here. Listen, I figured out how to have our own Thanksgiving, stuffed inside Fischoeder's Thanksgiving. Like a turducken. A poultry within a poultry. It's like Inception, with meats. Gene, before dinner, you come in and we'll play tackle in the kitchen. Then send Tina in for the wishbone. And then Louise. And at exactly 8:00, you all say you have to go to the bathroom and then you come to the kitchen for my toast. 8:00... that's your cue. I'm only half listening. Did you just say you want us to go to the bathroom in the kitchen? No, Louise. Come on, guys, "Belcher Thanksgiving" on three, ready? One, two... Ah, the Fischoeders! Come inside, family. Yay. Okay, uh... You guys go. (door slams) I'm still excited. Uh, can-can you open the door? Fischoeder: Go around the back, cook. Okay. Still gonna be good. This house was originally built by a paranoid arsenic manufacturer. Oh, I bet there are actual skeletons in these closets. And a dungeon full of Dungeness crabs. I bet when you flush the toilets, the water evaporates upwards and forms a rainbow. Two of you are correct. You already signed your liability waivers, so go explore. Awesome! (toilet flushes) So, Mr. Fisch... Tina: I was right about the toilets. Huh, I thought the kitchen would be more, uh, mansion-y. Mansions are for the owners, Bob, not the cooks. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going get drunk for dinner. Do you mean dressed? Dressed out of my mind. Got to loosen up, you know? Right, right. Got to get my s*x face on. I can't wait to see it. Well, Lin, this might not be so bad, right? This Thanksgiving. Neh. What? My hair! Now I got to go redo it. Great. Fine. Guess I'll just be here, alone. With uh... with the turkey. (in goofy voice): My name's Lance. Sorry. With Lance. How are you, Lance? (goofy voice): Pretty great. Oh, there are my little Fischies. Thanks for the new outfits. Sometimes you need a make-under. I'm glad you like them. Now, our job tonight is to fool the woman of my dreams into believing that we are a loving, happy nuclear family that she can destroy. Romantic. In order to keep you kids motivated, we're going to be playing by arcade rules. You'll be awarded these tickets for convincing performances as Fischoeder children. Game on. Wait, time out. Okay, game on again. I thought my shoe was untied. The one with the most tickets at the end of the evening can claim a gift from my prize room. The only prize I need is your love, father. And we're off and running. (growls) And just like every happy family, we now have a commissioned painng otius, holding the family crest covered in ten schlongs, which of course is German for "snakes." Oh-ho-ho. Look at the schlongs. (doorbell rings) Oh, she's here! She's here! Oh, God. Ooh, I'm so nervous. Places, people! Places! Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh. You ready for the oven? (in goofy voice): I dunno, Bob. It feels weird. We should be doing this at home. I know it's not the same, but it can still be fun. (goofy voice): Why don't you take a sip of that over there, Bob? That? (goofy voice): Yeah, that green bottle. It's, uh, absinthe. Doesn't this make you hallucinate? (goofy voice): Carpe diem! What? (goofy voice): Seize the day. All right, I'll take a little sip. This can't be that bad. Whoa. Weird. (goofy voice): Bob! Bob! Bob! What? (goofy voice): Can you leave the oven light on for me? I get scared. (chuckles) So cute. Here's the light. (goofy voice): It's too bright. Shelby, may I present my wife, Linda. Pleasure to meet you, Linda. Oh, I like that name, Linda. (loudly): And I'm Linda. Moving right along, these are my children, Gina, Team, and Lucy. Welcome to our happy home. Any ex-lover of my father's is a friend of mine. What unusual children. Calvin, your sperm did wonderfully. She took my sperm and ran with it. Because I'm his... (clearing throat) Because I... (clears throat) Because I'm his wife. Thank you, Linda. Say, do you kids like bullets? I think all kids like bullets. Think fast! Whoa! Whoa. Wow! Calvin, you kept my old r1fle. You weren't carrying a torch for me all these years, were you? Oh, of course not, I was just holding it for you. You can have it back. You don't mind if I cock this thing in here, do you? Cock away. (everyone shouting) Linda: Ow! Loud! That trick's called the "Reverse Cowgirl." I bet you could pierce Gene's ear from there. Ooh, do my belly button! Not till you're 18. If you teach me to sh**t, I'll teach you to regret teaching me to sh**t. And I can teach you to make burgers, like in our restau... Eh, eh! What is she talking about? All this talk about sh**ting is making me thirsty. Why don't we pull the trigger on a glass of wine? Ha-ha. I'm funny. I'm his funny wife. Being a family man suits you, Calvin. Hmm. You look better than I remember. When will Thanksgiving be over? I want it to be Father's Day every day! Very nice. Here, Father, let me refill your glass. You must be dehydrated from being so wonderful. Take it down a notch or two. Hey, Dad, remember when we did that thing that was fun and memorable? (whispering): That's pathetic. Um, hello, I'm your chef. Yes, this is our chef, uh, Burt. Here are your salads, and now I will, uh, go tackle the turkey. Did you hear that, Gene? I'm gonna go tackle the turkey. Tackle away. Tackle the turkey. Ah! Ow. (laughter) Oh! That was a great sh*t. Really, really funny. Do another one. Ooh! Do a crouton. Uh, no, I'm gonna go back to the kitchen now. So, uh, here I go. Back to the kitchen. Gene, go apologize to the cook. (groans) Gene! Buddy, football time. Let the traditions begin. (sighs) Let's make this quick. All right, I got the ball on the one yard line and then I gotta punch it in: Hut, one! Hut, two! Hut, hut, hut, hike! Ow. Great game, Dad, hit the showers. But we barely played. Gotta get out there and get more tickets. Tickets? What are you talking about? I don't have time to explain this to the help. Fine, just send Tina in. And come back for my toast! You got it, Buddy. One for me... and one for Bob. I'm very good at drinking this. Thank you. There's my girl! Okay, time to break the wishbone, right? Oh, crap, it's still in the turkey. Well, maybe we can just pull it out a little early. Ow! Oh, my God, that's hot! Got some skin! Okay, you grab your end and let's do the wish-skin. Um, okay. Great, you won! Yay. What'd you wish for, more wish-skins? More tickets. I'm way behind in the best kid contest. Oh. So you're gonna leave? I'll send Louise in. Louise Belcher regrets to inform you she cannot attend the Turkey CSI: Miami due to a prior comtmenmi Oh, great, I guess I did all this for nothing. Ugh! (goofy voice): Remember, Bob, it's all an act. Thanks, Lance, you've been my rock through all this. I love you. Well, it's almost 8:00, so I'll do my toast, and the Belcher Thanksgiving will be back on track. I "yam" what I "yam." And what I "yam" is the luckiest man in the world. All: Yeah! Was that a great toast or what? You're the toastest with the mostest. Mwah! Kids: Aw... Family! Thanksgiving...! Lance, you're big. Mm-hmm! (gasps) (Bob laughing) (chuckles) 

  (laughing continues) (gasps) Oh! (Bob yelling excitedly) (Bob blowing notes on bottle) This is weird, right? (timer dings) Oh, my God! (goofy voice): What? What's going on? It's 8:35! My toast! (all laughing) Oh, Fischoeder Dad, you are hilarious! (goofy voice): They're not coming, Bob. Yeah, I know, Lance. Ow! My face! Bobby, I need a chopped onion... stat! No one came in for my toast, Lin. My big toast. You can do your toast for us tomorrow. Tomorrow's not Thanksgiving. But tomorrow we'll have five months free rent. Because this is working... I think. Now come on, I need an onion so I can cry for my next scene. Chop-chop! (laughs) Get it? Fine. You don't want to come in here for my toast, I'll bring it out there. No, you will not, mister. I haven't even done my song yet. I'm coming out, Lin. Bob, you are drunk. (splutters) You're drunk. I am not. I've only had half of four bottles of wine. Just bring the turkey out and you can come back in here and take a nap on the floor like you do at home, okay? Now, let's go! (grunting, sighing) Thank you. Linda: All right! Thank you. That was called "Ode To Dad." Fischoeder: Bravo! And this is called "Better Ode To Dad." Get ready! (rhythmic grunting) I can't compete with that. You know, I am so emotional. What a wonderful... family we have. And it's... Hmm. It almost, it brings tears to my eyes. Hmm. Just a second... Gene (hushed): You're doing great mom. Really natural. (sobbing) Oh, you are so married. So gosh damn married! Hello, it's me, the cook, Bob... Or Burt. And this is Lance. Lance is a turkey. Lance, these are the jerks I mentioned in the kitchen, when I was talking to you. He seems like he's in a good place. So, without further ado, I will now give the traditional cook's toast that I do every year. Uh, maybe you should go back into the kitchen, Mr. Cook. Oh, shut up, Mrs. Fischoeder! Uh, ah, okay. Wow, there must be five months of dishes to do in there. You don't want to sleep in the basement again, Mr. Cook. Are you still talking?! You don't want to sleep without... Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah! Oh, dear! It's Thanksgiving again, and there's some "stuff-ing" I'm thankful for. (chuckles) ♪ Go on and pass the cranberries... ♪ Don't, Lin, don't! ♪ It's time to sing a little song now. ♪ Stop it! Stop! Wow, this is getting good. All right... (clears throat) Thanksgiving. (both grunting) Let's break the word down. Let me, uh, just... Thanks. Shh. Excuse me. Sorry. I've heard people use that word quite often. Up here. Let me just "pumpkin" you up by saying... Or "than" than. "pumpkin you up," right? Like "we have more than" day! Let's raise our glasses. Yes, raise your glasses. Tina, raise drop those glasses. Both: Raise them higher than that. ♪ Oh, pass the cranberry! ♪ All right. Shut up, Lin! ♪ Let's get a little lazy ♪ Fischoeder: Here's my toast, and what I say goes. Me? We'll go by applause. Everyone who liked the cook's toast best... Shh! Clap now! I don't need clapping. What I need is what every dad needs, hugging! Uh, kids, go hug your dad. Come on. No, your dad, your Fischoeder dad. Unbelievable. Wife, come! Oh, yes! Ah-ha, ha-ha. It's working. Let's seal the deal. No, no. Give me those lips. No... no... Lips. Lips. No, no. Lips. Lips. Okay, one. (screams) Whoa. Sick! Aw... Get your lips off her! Wow! Everybody wants everybody! This is so exciting. I believe the cook has had too much to drink. Oh, do you believe it?! I believe it in my heart of hearts. Oh, great, everyone wants to hear your beliefs! Back to the kitchen now! I'm not going back. Now this is a holiday. Is it cool if I grab a leg? No. You people don't deserve to eat Lance. Lance is my friend, okay? Ow, Lance, you're burning my arm. Put that turkey down. I pay your salary and your rent. Keep your blood money, Fischoeder! Bobby, come back! Not the gravy! Save me some dark meat! Lance, take care of my father! Get back here with that turkey! I'll get it back. I love a turkey hunt. Wait. What? They'll never catch us! Let's hide here. There he is! Oh, boy. (goofy voice): Duck, Bob, duck! You're a turkey, Lance. (goofy voice): Good one, Bob. They're gaining on us! (goofy voice): Run side to side! Okay, but I think this is slower. Shelby, stop! Don't sh**t him! What the...? Come back here with our turkey, cook! Never! He's mine! No, don't sh**t my dad! I'm not. I'm gonna sh**t the cook! And I won't k*ll him. I'm just gonna maim him! Gene: Tackle! (grunts) (thud) Oh, God, we k*lled Bobby! We k*lled Bobby! Dad! Why do they keep calling the cook "Dad"? Lin, he's sh*t. Oh, thank goodness. Oh, my God. Dad! Dad! Lance, talk to me. You're gonna be okay. (goofy voice): No, no I'm not gonna make it, Bob. Don't say that, Lance. Don't talk like that! You're gonna be fine! (goofy voice): No, I'm cold. I'm so cold. Get him a blanket! Get him a blanket! (mutters in goofy voice) What? What's he sayin'? I don't know. I can't understand. What's he sayin'?! He's just murmuring! Lance? Lance? Oh, he's gone!! Oh, Bobby, I'm so sorry about all this. I never want to be someone else's wife, even for pretend. Sorry we ruined your Thanksgiving, Dad. We were jerks. I'm sorry, too. I promise to tackle you every day for the rest of my life. I've been talking to a turkey for a long time now. But I drank a lot of absinthe, just to be fair. Oh, Bobby, come here. Mwah! Lin, not now, I'm grieving. I lost a friend today. This is so confusing! Well, it's clear to me that this cook has, uh, fathered these, uh, children with, uh, this... Oh, give it up. I'm not Fischoeder's wife, all right? He hired us to pretend to be his family so you'd be attracted to him... there. I'm touched that you would go to so much trouble for little old me. Oh, you're not old, and you're not little. Not where it counts. In the wabba-wabba. Oh, Calvin, this isn't gonna work. Oh. I respect myself too much not to be the other woman. Wow, you guys are insane. Let's get out of here. We can still have dinner at home. Wait! I almost forgot! I have the most tickets! And I know exactly what I want. Now this portrait will grow old for me and I'll stay nine forever. Oh! This "absence" is delicious. It's absinthe, Lin. You're absinthe. (laughs) Hey, Mom, are you hallucinating yet? Not yet. I need more. Okay, who wants what? I'll take a bullet piece, please. Me, too! I'll have a thigh. There's plenty of shrapnel for everyone... don't be shy. Good thing the bullet hit Lance, or else we'd be eating Dad. He'd taste old and bitter. I bet Dad would've made a great dinner. Thanks, Tina. Yeah, you're so plump. Oh. Aw, to delicious Bobby! Lin, don't toast to eating me. All (chanting): Eat Dad! Eat Dad! Eat Dad! Eat Bob! Eat Bob! Stop it.

Shh. So, Mort, you ordered a small? How small was it? What? Sorry, I'm taking a stand-up comedy class. I think I did something wrong. I thought it was funny. Ugh, the ice cream machine's stuck again. Hey, Mort, you're getting a free medium-- a free large-- a free extra large. Oh. You got to hit it just right, Dad. I said just right! Okay, kids, only one thing to do: ice cream for brunch. Teddy: Yay! Yeah, all right! Yay, free ice cream! Yeah. Let's just unplug it. Reach behind there and grab the plug. I found my retainer. Linda: You don't wear a retainer. Oh, God, you're right! Get it out of my mouth! Never mind, I got it. Aw. (door opens, bell jingles) Hi, Hugo, hope you're not here for ice cream. I'm lactose intolerant, Linda. Oh. I'm also intolerant of that suspicious-looking bicycle outside, Bob. Uh, why are you telling me? Maybe it's because you're the block captain. But you don't even live on this block. Well, I live in the quadrant and I happen to be the quadrant captain. Quadrant captain-- did you make that up? Did I make up these quadrant captain business cards? Why would you do that? I didn't actually mean to. Well, pick them up. No, now stand down. That bike has been there for 24 hours and the seat's missing. It's clearly abandoned. Fine, I'll take care of it. Don't be block-cocky, Bob, just do it. Jerk. Gene: Nailed him. You trying to steal my bike? No, someone thought it was, um. It's mine. Want to see the receipt? (farts) That's not a receipt. Where do you shop? I really thought being block captain would be more fun, like I'd have a g*n or a Taser or something. All I get is this whistle. Don't knock the whistle. Whistles stop hundreds of crimes every year. And thousands of basketball plays. And they make dolphins jump out of the water and eat fish. Dad, you could do that. Bob, I recall you raise either chinchillas or children. Which is it? Uh, children. Good. I'm focus-testing some ideas. I need a new blockbuster attraction at Wonder Wharf. Why don't you focus-test with the kids down at Wonder Wharf? Those sheep? I've already got their money. Besides, these children are a perfect cross-section of American youth. Yeah-- boy, girl, and Tina. I'm a tastemaker. When I talk, people listen. Guys? Mr. Fischoeder, we're adrenaline junkies. Oh. We like our rides pure, uncut, and assembled in "Méjico." I want something coming out of here, here, and/or here. The three-hole standard of excellence. Wait, walk me through the holes again. Let me throw some concepts at you. A bounce house full of jelly. Jam Slam! Try chutney. Keep pitching, Barnum. Scare-ousel-- a carousel where you ride on real horse skeletons. You had me at "horse" but lost me at "horse skeletons." You know, if you're looking for an attraction, this town actually has some interesting movie history. Hog Wash! Not you, Bob, it's an idea. Slide with the hogs. That's not bad. Yeah, well, seriously, in the '80s, they sh*t one of those shark movies right here in town-- The Deepening 3. Oh, yeah, in 3-D. Right, The Deepening 3D-eeepening. Oh, that shark made me so scared of the water, I spent the whole summer standing up to pee. (chuckles) Then I got into the habit. I like it. There's your attraction. Teddy, you remember The Deepening, right? Remember it? I was in it. Some of us locals worked on that movie. I was Handsome Lifeguard #3. Really? Seriously? Yeah, what? It's just, uh, you know, we're looking at the "after." It's kind of hard to picture the "before." Bob. Louise: Guys, the shark is for sale. What?! The shark? A prop house is selling the actual mechanical shark and they're ready to deal. The actual shark? Oh, wow, Mr. Fischoeder, you've got to get that shark. Teddy: Nah, don't, no, come on. Teddy, yes. You worked on the movie, you should be excited about this. Yeah, but just not that shark. Why, Teddy? I don't want to talk about it. Okay, that's one vote for yes and one cryptic vote for no. Let's run it past the focus group. Five-holer-- nostrils, too. Sounds like a winner. Noooo! Teddy, what is wrong with you? Uh, this ketchup is empty. Can I get a new ketchup, please? Mort: Some actor, this shark, a real ham. He chewed more scenery than Nicolas Cage. He really chewed it... with his shark teeth. (mic feedback screeches) Ha-ha-ha! (forced laughter) Ha, ha, ha! Louise, stop. Mort the mortician, everybody. Hey, I see Bob Belcher. All this was his idea. I know what you're thinking. That guy? Yes, the guy with the, uh, food place. Thank you. It's a restaurant. It's called Bob's... Now... please welcome champion water skier and shark attack survivor Kristi Sanducci. I'd like to thank the jackass who got the left-handed scissors. Kristi Sanducci. Always professional. Now, the real star of The Deepening 3D-eeepening-- the... shark. Bob: Whoo-hoo, shark, yeah! Linda: Ugh, someone has not aged well. What a butterface. We've filled her up with diesel, now let's see what she can do. (mechanical clicking) Tina: It's waving at us. Hi. So that one does that. Let's see what this one does. (yells) Yes! Thank you, God. Woop, wrong one... (stammering)... oh, here we... Oh, boy. Yes, yes, all part of the fun. Can someone pass my arm back up here? Give me that, Louise-- we've got to give it back. No way! I caught it! It's like the bouquet at a wedding. I'm going to get bit next! You having fun? I wasn't-- I... (grunts) Ow. Wow, she's good with that thing. She can do that and park anywhere she wants. (sighs) And so it begins. Why are we watching a movie about a fake shark when we could be at Wonder Wharf standing next to the real fake shark? Because this is how I want to remember the shark-- in its prime, scaring the crap out of Linda Blair. Fischoeder is crazy to keep that thing going. After what happened to that girl's arm and that lady's poor dog and that guy's balls-- you know, the juggler. Oh, yeah, Fischoeder's crazy to keep it going with all those people lining up, paying to see it, buying souvenirs. Nothing good can come from that shark. It's evil. Oh, there I am again. That's me in the red, white, and blue trunks. What's everybody looking at? Nothing. Nothing. Your body. Oh, my God, Linda Blair's boobs just popped out of her wet suit. Ooh! They're comin' at ya! Huh, this movie's a little bluer than I remember. Let's get to a good part. (funky soundtrack playing) Outdoor shower scene-- no. Yes. Topless car wash. Yes. Tina, no. Nude hot tub-- no. Yes. Oh, okay, here's some good clean shark. No. See that surfer getting eaten? I made out with her. She had her movie makeup on. Fake organs were coming out of her side. Pretty weird. The '80s-- am I right? You are not wrong. Why is the shark attacking that submarine? The CIA is training sharks to attack Soviet subs, and they're holding the shark's baby hostage in the nude hot tub. So the shark isn't bad; she's just protecting her baby. She's misunderstood. She just needs a friend. (soulful '80s-era pop ballad melody playing) (deep belching) It doesn't want to be here. This is exploitation. I'll show you exploitation. Go up there and get me that fin. You want her fin? I've got a guy. He wants it packed in ice and on the next plane. Why does he want a mechanical shark fin? Mechanical shark fin soup. Mmm, that does sound good. Don't cut off her fin. It's her best feature. God, Tina, it'll grow back. Oh, yeah, cut it off. I'm bare-backing a shark. Come on, Gene, chop-chop with the chop-chop. Whoa, it's tippy! Aah, no, Gene, get the fin! (screams) (Gene grunting) Are we safe here? Of course! It's safety tape. They can't just call it that if it's... Aah! Aah! Run, shark, run. We set it free. No, we didn't, we were never here. But we were. Remember right now? Yeah, okay, but you know what I just remembered? We were never here. Oh, okay. (funky soundtrack playing) Man, this movie is, like, 90% nude car wash. Bob, there's some kind of commotion down at the Wonder Wharf. It's like the Running of the Bulls but dumber. Yeah, but with a shark. Uh, yeah, it is a shark. Yeah, it's a shark. Fischoeder: Nothing to worry about. Having a little shark problem. Uh, good time to grab a hot dog or some popcorn. Oh, or a hot dog. Mr. Fischoeder, enough's enough, right? You've got to shut off the shark, right? I mean, now. Shut it off? Oh, no, no, I've got a packed park. I can't shut down my top attraction. I mean, I really can't. That thing's on till it runs out of gas. But what if it breaks out of Wonder Wharf? What happens then? Those are reinforced cement walls, Bob, built by somebody-- proud immigrants, I guess, I don't... Wha...? The shark fell over? That's crazy. We were at the library, right, guys? Yeah, exploring the wonderful world of books and periodicals. Uh, yeah. And microfiche. Oh, no, no, no, no... (tires screeching) Crap. Oh, my God! The shark's busted onto Ocean Avenue. This is my fault. I have to do something. What? I said, "This is my fault. I have to do something." Oh. Block Captain Bob. Yeah. (blowing weakly) God. On Ocean Avenue, local merchants fear they will become so much fish food, while police and fire officials are caught in a surf-and-turf battle. Meanwhile, local citizens are taking matters into their own hands. The block captain has called an emergency, all-block, shark-stopping meeting... (crashing) Edith: That shark is ruining my arts and crafts business! This town might do all right without arts, but crafts?! Where the hell are we gonna be without crafts?! Screw crafts! What about my liquor store? Let me talk! Everybody, listen! Calm down! You calm down! I lost a son! Seriously? A sun quilt. It was beautiful. Listen, we're gonna solve this! Yes, let's listen to Bob. He's the idea man behind the shark. He pooh-poohed all my safety concerns, by the way. What? Thank you. I have to run. N-No, I said it might be cool to get a mechanical shark. I didn't turn it loose. Yes, he did! No, I didn't! Nobody knows who did! Yeah, stop this insane witch hunt! It could've been anyone who wasn't at the library. The library? It's no use! They know we knocked the shark over! Wait, what? You did? No! That's just an expression. Hey, did you knock over the shark today? You know I did! You're the family from hell! They're destroying the town! Let's have a town meeting to decide what to do with the Belchers! (screeching) Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! Teddy, what are you doing? I'm trying to get everyone's attention, but I don't have any nails. Okay, so what do you want to say? I have something to say. Yes. What? I told you not to get that shark! I told you he was trouble! Now we need to join together to stop him. Ow! Don't you see? Us fighting with each other, that's what he wants! Ow! Teddy, stop! Yes, Teddy, thank you. Thank you. So, yeah, we've got to join together to stop the shark. Let's put our heads together, right? Block captain brainstorm. No bad ideas. Go. Topless car wash, like in the movie! Topless car... Don't write that down. Uh, Linda said there were no bad ideas, Bob. Well, she was wrong, Hugo. (muttering): Yes, like when she married you. What? What? I heard you mutter something. Yes, and when someone mutters, that means they're muttering to themself. (muttering): Huge mistake. Well, I heard you. What? I heard you mutter. Oh, really? What did I say? "Linda made a huge mistake." So we agree. Ha-ha. Someone else? Listen to me. I know how the shark thinks. It's confused. It doesn't know why you want to k*ll it. It just wants to go home. Tina, it's a machine. It's dumber than our toaster. Our toaster is also confused. It doesn't know why we put bagels in it. Oh, my God. Okay, we got four good ideas. Well, four Hail Marys we could try. (chants): Let's stop the shark! Or not. All: Let's stop the shark! Or not! Let's stop the shark! Or not. (mechanical whirring) 

  (metal clanging) If a spike strip can stop those drunk Shriners, it should be able to stop a shark. Here it comes! Here it comes! Ouch. Okay, we've given the shark spikes. I knew that would happen. Bob: That oil's gonna keep the shark from getting any traction. Ah... And we made it faster. Bravo, Bob! You want to catch a fish, you gotta think like a fisherman, right? Okay, now the shark is electrified! All you're doing is making the shark more dangerous, Bob. I can see that, Hugo! It was an FYI. Bob, the shark's getting pretty close to our restaurant. It's all right. We've saved the best idea for last: the big hole. Why'd we save our best idea for last? Because we didn't know it was the best idea until the other ideas were really terrible. Stupid. Anyway, we dig a big hole, the shark falls in and hopefully, end of our problems. Beginning of China's problems! Sorry, China! They'll nail it. They're really smart. Linda: Come on, keep going. Climb into your hole, you big mouse! (quietly): Turn around! It's a trick! (cheering) Ah-ha-ha! You did it, Bobby! The shark is gone! Gone, but not forgotten. Wait, what are we talking about again? Maybe you're not such a horrible, greasy, perverted, shabby, two-bit, filthy, disgusting pig. All right, thanks, thanks. (rumbling) What was that? That thing's still moving down there. But we buried it. (cracking, rumbling) I think it just ate its way into our basement! (dramatic musical sting) Dad, can we keep it? The shark is in our basement?! Well, there's only one way to find out for sure. Kids, stay here. Duh. Yeah, I thought our basement was scary before it had a shark in it. Bob, stop. You've done everything you can. You don't have to go down there. This whistle says I do. Gene: That whistle blows! (blows raspberry) Enough talk. This ends now. Mort and I will go with you, Bob. What? Oh, I mean, yes! Thanks, guys. That means a lot. Oh, good news, everyone! The dream team's on it! Ahab, Gray-hab, and Flab-hab! You want to come, Hugo? No, I'm good. Crowd control. Back up! Back up! Real quiet, all of a sudden. Quiet as a morgue. Morgues aren't all that quiet, actually. Maybe it finally ran out of gas. We could come back tomorrow. No! We gotta make sure it's dead, and then we gotta cut it up in little pieces so it never hurts anyone again! Whoa, Teddy, calm down. What happened with you and that shark, anyway? Sorry, Bob. You see, It's personal between me and this shark. We had a little run-in, back when I was working on that movie... I was chatting up that cute surfer girl. (distorted): Ohh...! (snickering) (distorted): Ugh! Well, you can forget about getting any of this! She could've been the one, Bob! I hit the craft service table pretty hard after that. That's when I started getting fat. Uh, I don't understand. Why aren't you mad at the shark operator? Oh, yeah, that's a good point. No, no! The shark drove him to it. It's evil, and now I'm fat. You're not that fat, Teddy. I'm wearing a guy girdle. It's called a Boydle. Look at me. Look at me! Okay, Teddy... Well, you know, look at me. (falsetto): Hi, Teddy. I'm Bob's belly. (both laughing) Oh, you always know what to say, Bob. Mort: Over here! I'm Mort's belly. Huh? What? We're not doing that bit anymore? What's going on in there? (rumbling) Did you guys hear that? (all yelling) Oh! We're gonna need a bigger restaurant! Oh, come on. Sorry. (all yelling) Hang on, Mort! (grunting) Not... fat... enough! (yelling) Mort!! No! I think Mort got eaten. Oh, I should've laughed more at that belly-talking thing he did. Mort, are you okay?! (Bob and Teddy yelling) I'm out! I'm literally grasping at straws! (yelling) Ahh! Teddy, you're being crushed! No, my Boydle's protecting me, but I don't know how long it's gonna hold! This is what you want, isn't it?! (hollow thudding) This is what you want! I'm torn. Dad raised me, but the shark gets me. If the shark eats our restaurant, is he our new boss? Shark boss! (chomping noises) I'm blacking out, Bobby! I don't know how to stop it. We've tried everything! It's too bad we can't make it die from cancer, like in the movie. It didn't die from cancer, Teddy. Oh, no, you're right. They sh*t the cancer ending, but it tested really bad. It didn't have the "pow." Really? Cancer? No pow? Yeah, they sh*t a whole new ending, remember? They went and poured wet cement down its throat. Yeah, and that would be really helpful if we had a cement mixer! (door bell tinkling) Maybe we do. The ice cream machine. She's right. We could fill up the shark with ice cream. That might mess it up, right? I chose you, Dad. Thanks, Tina. Over the shark. Thanks. Because I thought... Yes. Originally, it looked like maybe I would... Yes. Oh. Yeah, Dad, who was Tina really gonna choose? A broken-down wreck with the dead eyes, or a fake shark? Aww... You like that, Mom? Yeah. Okay, let's give it a try. All I have to do is plug it in. Ow! Hurry, Bob. Some of the teeth are getting under the Boydle! (Bob groaning) Stretch, Bob! Stretch! You call that stretching? Got it! (shuddering) My feet are getting cold. Must be making ice cream. (grunting) Oh, my Boydle came off! You got my Boydle, but you don't got me, you shark! Linda: It's working! The shark's getting all logy! I've had dreams like this. It's over. No, Bob. (yelling fiercely) Die! Die! Die! Now it's over. No, it's not dead! Just kidding, everybody. Just kidding. How shark was it? I still feel like I'm doing that wrong. (bell tinkling) Whoa, Bob! I love what you've done with the place. Listen, I'm gonna be out of town for awhile, but, uh, keep it up. Uh, we-we should talk about repairs for... No. Okay. I'm going to miss you, shark. Hmm, I'm gonna miss you, too, ice cream machine. He died the exact way I want to go: destroying the restaurant. Hey, how the hell are we gonna flush this thing down the toilet? Whoa, somebody lost their Boydle! It's mine now. (grunting) Ah, my little Bobby Block Captain. You saved the town. Eh, just part of the job. Gene: You're fired! I can't take credit for everything, Olsen, but as quadrant captain, I will. You're welcome. Who wants soup?
Wow, still can't believe this sale. Six thousand low-fold dispenser napkins for $58? What are they thinking? I don't know. Yeah, and they're two-ply. This is... this is a great day. A really great day. Wow, look how big and empty the parking lot is, huh? (low whistle) What do you say you get behind the wheel? What would I do behind the wheel? Drive. Is that legal? Well, no, but my father let me drive when I was about your age. Call it a perk for running errands with your dad. Let's make this kitty purr. Mm, go ahead. Try a turn. (Tina groans) Tina, why are you groaning? You're doing fine. (groaning louder) Rela... Tina, relax. Easy, easy. (continuous groaning) (chuckling): Okay, okay. Tina, you're kind of headed toward the only other car in the lot. You have plenty of time to turn, Tina, so just go ahead. Turn one way or the other... You're just swerving back and forth. Turn one way and stick with it, Tina. (continuous groaning) Tina, for the love of God, turn away or stop! The brakes, Tina! On the left! You're about to hit that car! The brakes! Hit the brakes! Oh, my God, it's bad. I ruined the car! You did. You really did. Okay, uh... Well, that's... Ugh. At least there doesn't seem to be any damage to the other car. No, I see a dent! There's a dent! That-That's a ding. Not even. It's like a little scratch. N-No, it's a dent! All right, we'll leave a note. You know, then again, for all we know, that probably was there, right? We have to leave a note! We have to leave a note! Okay, okay! You're- You're so honest. Who raised you? I don't know. Da... It was me. I did. (bell dings) What's with the cab? Yeah, where's the car? Um, the car is in the shop. There was a little accident and... What?! Wait, Lin, Lin. What? What happened? Calm down. We hit a parked car. Are you okay? What happened? My baby, wa... Look at me. Look at me. Oh, God. We're fine. Tina is fine. Oh, my baby. Oh, my baby. Wait, how'd you manage to hit a parked car? Are you drunk? No. You smell like wine. (chuckles) We-we were coming out of the restaurant supply store and... (phone rings) Hold on. Bob's Burgers. Oh, hi, Jimmy. Yeah, he's right here. It's Jimmy Pesto. Ugh, what does he want? Hello, Jimmy. Hello, Bob, want to hear a knock-knock joke? No. Knock-knock. I'm really not in the mood. Knock-knock! Ugh, who's there? You hit my car, dumbass. Eh, classic knock-knock. You've got to be kidding me. That was your car? Did you or did you not hear my knock-knock joke? O-Okay, look, what happened was... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, tell it to your insurance company. Oh, come on, Jimmy. I don't want my rates to go up. I'll just pay whatever the damage is and... No way. Not on your salary. I don't have time for you to work out an eight-cents-a-month payment plan. Ha. He's poor. (groans) Fine. We'll go through my insurance. Good-bye! You drive like a fart! Fart. So what happened? So anyway, I was driving, and I ran into what turned out to be Jimmy Pesto's car in the parking lot. But, Dad, I was... Come on, Tina. Help me carry the napkins down to the basement. Okay. Help you carry napkins? Yeah, Dad, be sure to lift with your legs. Bob: Ha-ha. Use the hand truck. You shouldn't be carrying anything at your age. Yeah, you're pregnant. You sit down, Dad. Hey, while your car is in the shop, I can drive you guys around. Oh, thank you, Mort, but we don't need to go anywhere. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, we'd get to ride in the hearse? There's lots of places we need to go. What? Where? Nightclubs, day clubs, smoky cafes... Chinatown, Thai Town... Library. Great, I'm heading out now if you want to come with. I call shotgun. I call coffin. No fair, I want coffin! Good, it was a trick! I'm too scared to ride coffin. So we just have to say I was driving, okay? That's lying. That's not right. That's true, Tina. Lying is wrong, and you should never do it. Unless an idiot named Jimmy Pesto makes you go through insurance, which he is. So we have to lie this one time. What's next? Perjury? Human trafficking? Look, our insurance will go up a little, but we'll be fine. We just can't tell anyone about it. Even Mom? Ugh, especially Mom. She can't lie. But I can't lie, either. You know what, it's not even really a lie. It's a secret. It's our shared secret. Huh, maybe if I had a backstory? A backstory? Do I have a boyfriend in this scenario? Uh, we should probably just stick to the necessary facts. Oh, okay. Fine, all right, you have a secret boyfriend in this scenario. One that you can't ever talk about. What's his name? Um, Sebastian. He plays lacrosse, and he loves me. Mm-hmm. But he loves lacrosse more. Uh, yeah. How long is his hair? I-I-I don't know, but it's greasy. Yes. So Mort, what special features does this baby have? Special features? Like what? You know, like an oil slick in case you're being followed by mourners? Oh, no, no, nothing like that. Is there a hammer in case one of them comes back to life? No, no hammers. I guess you have to use your bare hands then. You're cute. Yeah. Whoa, how'd you swing that? Oh, the police escort? In addition to giving you kids a lift, I'm also on my way to a funeral. k*ll*ing two birds with one stone. So there's a dead body back there? And two birds. And two buns! Go, go, go, go, go, go! Take that, po-po! Come on, kids, please. This is not... Sorry! Oil slick, go. (hissing) Why are you wearing a hair net? Because stress is making my hair fall out. Look at me. Tina, you have the fullest head of hair in the family. I would k*ll for that hairline. I believe you would. Take it easy. Take it easy. This is all wrong. I'm going to jail. Or hell. Or hell jail. What's for lunch today? Your lies! No! That's what we had yesterday. Look, I know it's hard, but I swear it will get easier. Just hang in there; we'll get through this. (bell dings) Hey, there. What can I get for you? Oh, I'm not having anything, but I do have a few questions. I'm Chase Kaminsky, your insurance adjuster. (groaning) What's that sound? Uh, uh, what sound? (groaning continues) I don't hear anything. Oh that, that, yes, I hear that. That's probably my daughter. Is she all right? I-I-I think it's a song. She's always singing, so... it's probably a song. You know, kids and their music. (thud) Uh, oh. She passed out. Better go check on her. Everything's fine, Tina. We're going to go out there and act like we didn't do anything wrong, which we didn't, kind of. But lying to Mom was one thing; lying to the insurance guy is another. (groaning) Okay, stop, stop making that sound. He hears it. Okay. All right, let's-let's have you go down to the basement and, um, sweep something. Like dirt? Yes, like dirt. So, I was in park, but I thought it was in drive, so I was thinking, "Uh, why am I not moving?" Yeah, well, we've all done that. I mean, I haven't, but somebody must have. We... you did. (laughing) Yeah, I did. (forced laughing) Oh, God. Uh, this is my daughter, Tina. Laughing is another one of her noises. Oh, is that laughing? I was in the car with my dad. Uh, in the passenger seat, she was. Yeah, where passengers sit. Right, so after I put it in park, and I was moving, I thought, "Am I in neutral?" So I shifted into gear and lurched forward. And then a butterfly flew in the window and Dad started swatting at it. (bell dings) A butterfly? What butterfly? Wha-What butterfly? Hey, Linda, kids. Uh, this is Chase. He's from the insurance company. I was just telling him what happened, uh... Uh, yes, I was... I was just getting to the butterfly part of the story. I thought it was a bee, and I was startled. So I was, ah... swatting at it. Dad's scared of butterflies. Uh-oh, Dad, look out. There's a ladybug! Stop it. All right, so, uh, anyway, back to the story, uh, Chase. Uh, I mean, not a story; it's the truth. Um, so I swerved and... A cormorant flew in the window. What's a cormorant? It's a kind of seabird. We learned about them in school. In China they use them to catch fish. Yeah, thanks, Tina. Sorry I left out the cormorant. Gene: A cormorant? What an auspicious sign. Anyway, that's how I hit the car. Butterfly, then cormorant. Okay! Really? We'll get your claim check cut right away. Thanks for your business, Bob. (bell dings) Thank you. That was easy, right? Phew. One more thing. Aah! Aah! It just occurred to me to ask you... Here it comes. I'm hosting a barbecue this Sunday. My caterer fell through. Boom, I meet you. What do you say? You ever take this show on the road? Oh, um, cater your party? Mm-hmm. Sounds great. We'll do it. Our only other employees are the kids. Is that... is that okay? Great! Here's my number. Huh. See you all on Sunday. Great. Where's the bathroom in this thing? Under here? No. No, it's not there. Yeah, it's fine. Well no, just... Can you just hold it a little longer? Well, it's not a problem. No, no, please. Don't worry about it. I'm meeting a grieving widow in ten minutes. Oh, I have to go, too. Hey, look! "Three bedroom, two bath." We can both go. Ah, all right. But make it quick. Got to go. Got to go. Got to go. Everything okay in there? Everything's great. I had to pee, but one thing led to another. Bam, I showered. So our grandpa died. That's him out front. He's in the to-go box. His last wish was to be buried at the house he was m*rder*d in. Yeah, with the shovel he was m*rder*d with. Can you believe he was poisoned with a shovel? (stammering) We'll take it! Kids. Ah, perfect timing. Mortimer, give this fellow a fair price for the house, and we'll meet you in the car. Hey, thanks for the lift, Mort. Uh, shouldn't be more than a couple hours, so, uh... are you gonna wait here or come back? Well, it's an hour back to my place, so I guess I'll just sit in the hearse. Maybe grab a nap in the back. Uh-huh. A nap in the back of a hearse? Who says morticians are creepy? Ha-ha. Well, all this gas is getting pretty expensive. A hearse doesn't exactly sip gas. It's a big vehicle, you know? Uh-huh. But you know, if you would like to chip in that would be so great because... Great, we'll see you in a few. Okay. All right. See you soon. That's fine. Why are we even here? You said it would all be over after the one lie. Well, we couldn't exactly say no to Chase, Tina. That would make it worse. After the barbecue, I promise, everything will go back to normal. Will it? Or is that another lie? Whoa, easy. You've gotta calm down. Let's, let's, let's see your "everything is okay" face. Um, no, no, no, that's, that's not, that's... No, that's bad. No, don't do that face. Like, like this? No. Just stop doing the face. How about this? And stay with me here by the grill. That way your sweat will look more natural. So then a butterfly spooks him, and he crashes our freaking car! (laughs) Hey, your wife has 'em roaring over there, talking about your little fender-bender. Uh. Uh, Tina, I'll be right back. Mm... Just try and keep the meat off the ground. Okay... You heard of the butterfly effect? If a butterfly flaps its wings, Bob crashes his car! (laughs) Okay, Linda. Let's, uh, settle down. Oh, what? I'm making conversation. And he says I'm a bad driver! Tina: Ah! Ah...! Ah...! Tina! Oh, call the fire department! Oh! Oh! Oh! Ooh! Ooh, my face! Tina, no one's blaming you for this, but what wrong thing did you do?! I don't know. I was cooking like normal. Maybe I had the flame too high? Why would you let me around fire? All right, Tina, calm down. This is, this is bad, but it was an accident. We'll, we'll tell Chase we're sorry. And that we lied about the car accident. What?! No. No-no-no-no-no-no. We're, we're in too deep now. We have to stick to our story. Oh, this is horrible. It's horrible! We barbecued that poor man's house. (gasps) Wait, who's this "we"? I was locking Gene in the garden shed when Tina was playing Firestarter. I burrowed out like a little mole! (growls) Louise is right. I'm a firestarter and a jinx. Yep. And I'm going to destroy this family. You're the reason I'm fat! I know. Oh, my God, Chase. I, I don't know what to say. We're, we're so sorry. (house creaks) Bob, it's okay. This was still a better-than-average party for me. Really? But your, but your house. Your-Your really nice house is gone! Well, this might surprise you. I have insurance! (laughs) (sporadic laughing) Yeah, I lost a lifetime of memories and my cat Spritzal. I k*lled your cat?! Well, no, Spritzal died last week. Natural causes. She's, uh, she's peeing in God's shoes now. Too soon! But her ashes were in there. Well, technically, they still are, aren't they, buddy? (sobs) Look, you all go home and just forget about this, okay? I'm just so grateful that no one got hurt. Ow. Coming through! I'm a firestarter and a jinx. And I'm going to destroy this family. We're in too deep now! We have to stick to our story! (both scream) Huh?! Wha...?! (screams) Screaming! (keyboard plays sampled scream) Wha...? Wha...? Gene! What the heck is going on? My stomach is in knots. Did you eat rope again? Tina, sweetie, is this about the fire? Because houses can be rebuilt. No one was in it, honey. But my conscience is still on fire. Okay, enough. I, I can't stand to see Tina like this. Listen, I lied about who was driving our car during the accident. Huh?! I let Tina drive a little in the parking lot. No fair! Mort doesn't let us drive! And then I made everything worse by lying about it. Why didn't you tell me? Because you're terrible at keeping secrets. You just blurt everything out. Sorry we're late! Bob had diarrhea! ♪ Running down the gutter ♪
♪ With the piece of bread and butter, diarrhea. ♪ 

  (makes fart noise) Lin! I love you, Mom. Anyway, I shouldn't have kept this from you. I was wrong. (keyboard scream) Stop it. I'm going down to Chase's office first thing in the morning to come clean. I'm going with you. Yes! Good. We'll tell some truth! "Hey, while your car's in the shop, I can drive you guys around." Why did I say that? What's wrong with me? Oh, hey, guys! What can I do for you? Hi, Chase. Uh, I have something I need to tell you. Is it about my dead fish? 'Cause I already know. I wasn't driving when I had the car accident. Tina was. It's true. I was. (sighs) I knew that. You knew? You knew? What, you thought you were fooling me with that cockamamie story about a butterfly and a bird? A cormorant. Whatever. Of course I knew! I figured if I scratched your back, you'd scratch mine. Wait. I-I don't want to scratch your back. You already did. Tina's "accidental" fire? No accident. It was an accident, I swear! What are you talking about? We're all in on this, compadres! I looked the other way on your fender-bender. You gave me a convenient cover to burn down my house. Why would you burn down your own house? 'Cause I'm covered for twice what it's worth. And no one is gonna question my claim when little Tina was left in charge of the grill. How did you know I was going to start a fire? Well, you didn't. My good buddy odorless kerosene did. Ugh! So I'm not a jinx. I, I can't believe what you're saying. Well, believe this. It's your cut! My cut? I'm... I'm not taking your money. Oh, think about it, you two. We'll be the three amigos of insurance fraud. Restaurants are disaster magnets! Broken pipes, slip-and-falls, her. Aw... Hey. I make sure you get the maximum payout, minus a small percent, of course. Hey, we're not gonna commit insurance fraud. Yeah, that doesn't sound like something you'd do. Oh, wait, you already did! Your daddy could go to jail! Huh?! Huh! Huh! Chase, you can't be serious... Huh! Huh! Serious as a judge. Judges, by the way, are most interested in the testimony of the insurance adjuster. And I will testify against you. Oh, I got it! You'll flood your basement! Why are you doing this to us? Because you're my golden goose. And I'm not letting you get away. You are the worst insurance adjuster. But the world's greatest uncle. (clicks tongue) So, Chase is blackmailing us. And if we don't go along with his scam and flood the basement, he's gonna turn me in. Flood the basement? But my collage supplies! They're just magazines, Mom. They are '90s Cosmopolitans from the '90s. Lin, let's focus on the blackmailing. Huh! Huh! We gotta take that son of a b1tch down! Language. Sorry, Mom. Tina's right. We need to come up with an idea to get us out of this. Huh! Huh! Huh! Tina, stop doing that. It's disturbing and scary. Wait. That's it! What is? What if we scare Chase so bad he'll never want to see us again? Hmm. That could work. Scare him? How? Boo! Ah! (bell jingles) Good morning, Bob! Or should I call you "Rob" since we're gonna be stealing money together? I'm sorry. It was too good to resist. Yeah, that was hilarious. Uh, so anyway, my basement flooded. Luckily, we're covered. Uh, Bob, will you send the kids up? Their breakfast is getting cold. They aren't down here. What are you talking about? Of course they are. They were playing down in the basement. The basement?! Bobby, what's the matter? My babies! No...! Agh! Agh! Oh, my God, no...! I went too far! What have I done?! My kids...! My children are dead! Bobby, why?! Bob, I can't handle this! I never saw this... Okay, I'm leaving! I'm sorry! You'll never hear from me again! And... scene. Eh? Great performances by all three of us, huh? Oh. You figured it out. Come on. You didn't really expect me to buy that, did you, Bob? Uh, sorta. Yes. Your acting is terrible. You closed the door. You didn't even try to resuscitate your kids! Yeah, It turns out the kids can't hold their breath that long. And we were gonna give 'em snorkels, but, uh... Snorkels. Yeah, uh, you know what? Never mind. Snorkel. Kids, come upstairs. Now let's get this paperwork started! Get this claim processed! And remember, this stays just between us. No one can ever know. Bob, Lin, oh, good. You're, you're both here. Listen, I, I got something stuck in my craw. Not a good time, Mort. Uh, you know, it's never a good time for these things. You're my neighbors and I love you, and I, I love your kids. I mean, up to a point But I'm not a taxi, okay?! All right. Sorry, That came out wrong. A little over the top. Let me, let me start over. Look, we're getting our car back tomorrow. So we don't need any more rides, Mort. Yeah, we left you a note and a thank-you package on your doorstep. Oh, so you did. Okay. Well, I mean, that wasn't necessary. What a lovely surprise. All right, I'm gonna go now. Okay, Chase. You, you caught us. But you're playing with fire... Fire. ...and water, literally. And eventually, somebody is going to get hurt. (bark sound) Gene, stop it! Ah! Don't insult me, Bob. You're new to this. I'm the pro. I've pulled hundreds of scams, and I'm gonna pull hundreds more. Now for our next fraud, I'm thinking lightning. A big surge could mess up all these incredibly expensive appliances. Am I nuts? Yes. Well, off to process this flood claim. Talk soon, partner! Oh, my God. We're stuck with this guy forever. Like me and this piece of corn in my teeth. Right, corn? Are we? I've pulled hundreds of scams, and I'm gonna pull hundreds more. Ha! Tina, that's brilliant! Oh, sure, when she does it, it's brilliant. That scammer is going to the slammer! Buh-bye, baby! Tina, do you realize what this means? You saved the family. I guess it's all part of learning to drive. (farting) (lion roars) (lasers firing) (farting) Uh, the, this one. For our next fraud, I'm thinking lightning! Hey! Hey, Bob! Bob, look! (mimics tires screeching, crash sound) That's you. Well, I'm glad this week is behind us. This was the worst week of my life. But I'm better for it. This was the worst week of your life, Tina? You got to crash a car and burn down a house! I got to do nothing! Fine. Here, Louise, you can break this plate. Ah! No fair! I want one! Yeah! That felt good. I want another one! No, that's it. Here, give me one! Stop! Lin, what are you doing? What? They're... I hate these plates. Stop breaking plates! Lin! Ah! Ah-ha-ha, it's fun. Smash! Watch me break this plate and the window! No!
Hey, remember my fart from last night? Be more specific. Maybe this will ring a bell. (fart noise) Oh, yeah. (farting "Yankee Doodle Dandy") I taught it to love its country. It's "Stankee Doodle Dandy." (laughter) Cool. Play something else. Play "Happy Birthday" 'cause my birthday's coming up. Play "Happy Stankee Birthday." Do it. Do it. It'll be funny. Do it. Hey, Courtney, take a chill pill. (gasping) Oh, my gosh. Uh... No, it's all right. No, guys, guys. I will take a chill pill, I will. Because I have a congenital heart condition, and I take them every day. I had shingles once. I have a cut on my leg. Those things aren't congenital. (school bell ringing) Show's over. We got to get our congenitals to class. (door bell dings) Hi, Lin. Hey, Gretchen. Just came by to return this bottle of water you left at the salon. When did I leave that there? Two weeks ago. Oh. Hey, do you guys have a lost and found? Yeah. Why? What'd you lose? 15 pounds. Look at me. Oh, yeah, you lost weight. Good for you. Wow, what's your secret, Gretchen? I went on the Skin Deep diet. You can only eat fruits and vegetable skins, and the weight just fell right off. One time, I accidentally ate a banana peel, but I didn't look like you afterwards. (laughter) Whoa. Humph, err... Well, I got to run. Hey, Gretchen. Wow, you look great. Did you lose weight? Little bit. Look-- my tattoo's not stretched out anymore. It almost looks like a regular dolphin. Wow, yeah. Look at my thigh tattoo, Bobby. Oh, let me pull my shorts up here. It's okay. Okay. All right. Bye, Gretchen. Bye, everybody. Bye. You're perfect the way you are. Don't lose one more pound. I won't, probably. I don't know. (laughs) Gretchen looks good, huh? Yeah, I guess she looks all right. Why is your eye twitching? Because I'm very happy for her. So what if she's the hot one now, and I'm the one with the muffin top. Oh, come on, Lin, you look great. I like your muffin top. So you think I have a muffin top? What? No, no, I said... No. I'm going on that diet, Bob, and when I'm done, I'm gonna look like Gretchen's skinny sister. Gretchen's sister is skinny, Lin, but it's because she's on methamphetamines. Whatever works, Teddy. Don't judge! (sucking, snorting) If you guys are trying to cut the line, forget it. Lenny's giving us backwards cuts. Backwards cuts? They found a loophole. Hey, Gene, guess what? What, Rupa? I know someone who likes you. Is it Lenny? 'Cause I want backwards cuts. I think she means someone like-likes you. Uh-huh. Oh. Is it the school nurse? She said I was the perfect temperature. Can't tell you. It's a secret. Aw, I guess we'll never know now. Well, whoever she is, I hope she appreciates that I can do this. Ah, ah, baa, baa, ba. Dun dun da-dun-dun, baa-baa. I don't get it. Bop. Bop. I try and try and he ends up with the secret crush. Maybe don't try so hard, girlfriend. Okay, I see your point. Who do you think like-likes Gene? "Puberty, puberty, puberty." That's all I hear when you guys talk. But we're his sisters. What if we don't approve of her? Oh, judging people. Well, when you put it like that... Bad hair, bad breath, bad attitude, eyes, nose, mouth, posture... So, we know it's not Sarah, Wendy or Lizzie. Maybe it's Julie? Nah, she like-likes Lenny Destefano. Geez, who isn't on the Lenny Destefano train. It sold out even before it left the station. Uh-huh. What about Rupa? Maybe she told us about the secret crush to throw us off her trail? No. Rupa's not that smart. She thought elbow macaroni was made of elbows. Oh, (forced laugh) and that's not true. Maybe it's someone we're not thinking of. (both gasping) Both: Courtney Wheeler! (both screaming) Hi, Gene. I heard somebody like-likes you. Do you know who it is? Nope. (screaming) She's in your grade, and she thinks you're really cute. And she has blond hair. And she's looking right at you. It's me! (laughs, snorts) Oh, boy. (screaming) So, do you like-like Courtney? Do you want to go out with her? (screaming) Uh... (screaming) Uh... Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. You like-like her, right? Yes. Uh... (screaming) I guess? (giggling, screaming) Oh, my God, I can't believe he said yes, But he did. You guys are going out. Let's make it official. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. (screaming) Aw. Uh, is this forever? Oh right, I forgot. Gene: Oh, no. There it is. It's all, eh, written down. (snorts) Uh-huh, uh-huh. All right. Well, thank you. Bog Harbor Catholic has an opening. You'll just need to wear a skirt and go by the name Eugenia. Louise, what are you talking about? Gene's switching schools. Gene, why do you want to switch schools? (gasps) Are you being bullied? Who's hurting my baby boy? I wish I had a bully. This is way worse. Courtney Wheeler like-likes him. Oh...! Courtney asked Gene if he wanted to go out with her, and he said yes. All right, Gene, you're on the board. Way to go. I hear dating bells. So, who's Courtney? Courtney Wheeler is the most annoying girl in my grade. In school. In the world. Oh, well, what's so bad about her? She talks too much, she breathes too loud, and she's always sucking on her necklace. (slurping noises) And her breath smells like sweat. Yeah, and she talks on her phone when she goes to the bathroom. It's confusing. Courtney: Hey, how's it going? Good. Thanks for asking. I'm in the bathroom. Where are you? I'm in the bathroom, too. I thought you knew that. Sorry, hold on. Some girl thinks I'm talking to her. Oh, well get rid of her. I'll wait here. Gene, then why did you say you'd go out with her? Her friends were staring at me! I didn't want to be a jerk, Dad. Well, you're not being a jerk if you don't like her. Like-like her. Like-like her. Your father's right, Gene. When did Mom start eating garbage? These are potato peels. I'm on the Skin Deep diet. I'm only allowed to eat fruit and vegetable skins. It's delicious. You know, the longer you wait, the harder it's gonna be to tell her how you really feel. Oh, yeah? When are you gonna tell Mom how you really feel? Linda: Huh? Huh? What'd he say? Hi, Gene. Hi, Courtney. Both: Aww. So cute. We're walking into school together. 'Cause, you know, now we're going out. Take my hand. You should know when you hold hands with me, you hold hands with everything I've ever eaten. I don't care if they're sticky. Just makes them harder to pull apart. (anxious whimpering) Both: So cute. Unbelievable. You guys, we're going in. Yech! Do you know where to hit me on my head to give me amnesia? Right here. Who am I? Tina, try again. Who am I? Tina, try again. Who am I?

Thanks, Lin. What? Gene, let me get this straight. I'm driving you on a date with a girl who you don't like and should've broken up with by now? Like-like. Tina, I know. Actually, it's a double date. Julie and Lenny Destefano are coming. Julie better not get too attached to Lenny. That is one stallion that won't be broken. Here, Dad, you'll probably need ear plugs. And if those aren't enough, hit yourself over the head with this. I'm sure she's not that bad, Louise. Hmm... she kind of is. Ehh... you would be wrong. Prepare to be surprised. Dad, take it, take it. I don't even need it back, just take it. Good-bye. All right, well, good luck finding a drive-thru hammer store. (giggles, snorts) Kick, kick, kick. Courtney, will you stop kicking the seat? I'm not kicking. Kick. Really? I can feel it. And you're saying kick. No. It's not me. Kick. Well, Julie's too far away. And it's not Lenny. Not me, Mr. B. Oh, I know, Lenny. Maybe you're just imagining it. Kick. Did you feel that? Yes. Kick. How about that? Courtney, please. Courtney can't control her legs because she has a congenital heart condition. What do those things have to do with each other? What does anything have to do with each other? (grunts) Oh, my God. (whispering): Gene. What? She's so annoying. I know. You have to break up with her. I know. Get back in the car. We can drive away. Seriously? I think so. Forget it, forget it. It's too late. Here she comes. I don't know how to break up with her, Dad. Just.... Oh hi, Courtney. We were just talking. Just chatting. Come on, Gene, let's go, come on! I just want to finish these chats with Dad. Dad, I just want to chat with you some more. We have to go get seats in the back row 'cause people complain about the way I chew for some reason. Gene, I'm so sorry. I want to break up with Courtney, but it's so hard. My life is more difficult than anyone else's on the planet, and, yes, I'm including starving children, so don't ask. Why don't we practice? Tina, you be Courtney. Gene, break up with her. Go ahead, you can do it. Courtney, I think we should break up. Oh, okay. Please don't be sad. No, I get it. It's fine. It wouldn't have worked anyway. This is so hard! Can't I just wait till we go to different colleges and lose touch? You're doing good. You're doing good. Come on, try it with me. Courtney, I think we should break up. What?! You'll never break up with me! I will k*ll you first! (screams) Forget it. I'm not doing it. Yes, you are. Again! Courtney, I think we should break up. Nooooo! Again! I think we should break up. (screaming) Courtney, I think we should break up. I understand. Again. Courtney, I think we should break up. You're ready. (muttering): I think we should break up. I think we should break up. I think we should break up. We don't want any. Okay, bye. Hold on, wait a second. I'm kidding. That was a joke. What can I do for you? Is Courtney home? Who's asking? I'm Gene. Oh, so you're the famous Gene. Come on in, famous Gene. Uh... okay. Courtney! Hold on, I'm yell... You got to yell up the stairs. She can't hear me. Gene's down here, Court!

Yeah, you don't even like-like her. No, I think I might like-like her now. No, you don't. Nah, you don't, honey. Why don't you try speaking in words, instead of your damn dirty lies! Seriously!

Hey, Lin, can you check the burgers on the grill for me? I can't be around food right now, Bob. You do realize you work in a restaurant, right? Don't say restaurant; it makes me hungry. You okay, Linda? Mom's cranky because she's only had fruit and vegetable skins for three days. Is your name Linda? I don't think so! Whoa. I'm sorry, honey. Come here; I'm sorry. (moaning) Come here.

Now I've k*lled her. You didn't k*ll Courtney, Gene. Yeah, honey, she'll be okay. Probably. Look at the bright side: You'll never have to go out with any girls again, because they all hate you. They hate me, Doug hates me... Lenny hates you. My career is ruined. Gene, Doug wasn't gonna give you a record deal. He doesn't even give out record deals. He doesn't have that power. Yes, he does! No, he doesn't. You don't know anything about the music business. (high-pitched): Look, the doctor's coming over. Tina, are you still doing helium? No... Tina! I like it. Give me some. Doctor: Gene... would you like to see her now? Uh, I'm good. Now's the time. Dad, what do I say to her? (high-pitched): Just make light small talk. Yeah, cheer her up. Make some fart noises, huh? I don't think I have it in me. (farting sound) Oh! I do! There he is. (monitor beeping, Courtney snoring) Gene, is that you? Yes. (whimpers weakly) P... Put my necklace in my mouth? (groans) (sucks, moans with pleasure) Did you really mean those things that you said? No! Well, a little bit. I'm sorry. So, you don't like-like me? No, but... I like things about you. Like your dad and his stuff. (groans weakly) You were using me. I prefer the term "networking." Gene, if you're gonna break up with me, break up with me. I can take it. (snorting) (sighing) Courtney, I think we should break up. (gasps) (steady flatline beep) Oh, my God! Courtney! Doctor, do something! There's nothing we can do. You broke her heart. (gasps) Psych!

You should've seen your face. Did you see his face? It was very funny. You scared me! I think you kind of deserved it, after what you did to me. I guess you're right. It's okay. I'll forgive you. If you get Peter Pescadero to go out with me. Peter's got partial hearing loss. It's a perfect match. And if you clean my bedpan. (sighs heavily) Fair enough. Doug, can I still visit you in gear heaven? Nope. Not a chance in gear hell, Gene. Okeydokey. What the hell? I didn't lose a thing! You're wearing clothes; that adds a little weight. You're right.

We still need to find a hat and something for the mailman. Please tell me you sell gift certificates. I, uh, I have a napkin and a pen, so I can write one. You know, Chet may be a strange guy, but his display really upped our foot traffic. Okay, Chet. We're closed. You can move now. (sighs): Whew! Ah! I am full of lactic acid and ideas for tomorrow's window! Ah! You're gonna do a different one tomorrow? Tomorrow and then the next day and then the next day and then the next day and then the next day and then it's Christmas, so I'll stop. Can we help? I want to be a Gene-equin! I'll be a Tina-quin.

Chet: Okay. Anything jumping out at you for tomorrow's display? I found a train! The most civilized form of toy travel. This would look good in my new apartment. It was a joke at first, but now I'm starting to expect it. This is fun, teaming up, you know? I used to do windows with my wife, Nadine. Oh, you're married? We're separated. It's okay.

We'll probably stay at my place in Manhattan. I have a loft that was being renovated, and I cannot wait to see how it turned out. Bob: What?!
Linda: ♪ Dish-a-dee-do ♪
♪ Dish-a-de-dee, da-da-washin' the dishes ♪
♪ Aba-ba-ba-ba. ♪ All right, all done with the dishes. Time for family game night. Whoo! Left hand red. Whoa-oh! I'm losing my balance. Whoa! Bob? Kids? Where is everyone? What's up? (kids grunting) Louise: Take that. And that. You naughty witch. What's, uh... what's going on? It's this thing we do with Dad. Yah! It's called "stone the witch." Dad's the witch, but it's just pretend. Right, Dad? Well, as you know, it's family game night and things are really heating up in the living room, so, you know... Come on, kids. I feel limber. I'm ready to dominate. Um, how about a rain check on that? Let me up. We're kind of in the middle of something here. Well, then I'll just play this with you guys. Whoa, ooh, here comes the blanket. That'll warm you to d*ath. Yeah. And, oh, ooh... how about this catalog? You can learn all about the season's new blazers. Wait, I'm lost. Okay, let's take five, everybody. What? No, hey, ooh, how about doilies? We can have a fancy witch with a doily hat. Hmm. Mom, it's over. You ruined it, okay? You "mommed" it all up. Uh-oh. What's that supposed to mean? Dad's here... did he "dad" it all up? Yeah, but that's a good thing. Oh, boy. Fine! I don't want to play your dumb old game anyway. Well, that's 'cause you suck at it. (gasps) Uh-oh. Ouch. Oh, God. Don't you talk to me that way, Miss Smart Mouth. You just bought yourself a ticket to your room. Oh, fine. Best money I ever spent. You can't ruin anything in there. (groans) I'm going back to family game night by myself! Oh. Oh. Oops. May I? I'd look great in that. I'd look great in that. I'd look great in that. Linda: Right foot blue. Terrific, I win. (grunting) Lin, you okay? Mm-hmm. You're not mad, are you? No, no. Okay, well, good night. Oh, you just think you're so much fun. Don't you, Mr. Fun Buns? What? I'm sorry. It's just that Louise. She's always liked you better. Ever since she was a baby. Are you Mommy's little girl? Dada. And Mama. Dada. Mama. Dada. Mama. Dada. Dada. Mama. Dada. Mama. Dada. M... Ma... Da... Da... Ma. Ma. Ma. Da. Da. Da. Da, da, da! Ma... ma! All right, you know what? Change your own diaper. Well, don't worry, Lin. She's just going through a phase. A nine-year phase... she'll grow out of it. Well, I'm not waiting for that. According to the Phenomimom... The Phenomimom? It's a mommy blog, by Dakota Applebaum. She says one way mothers and daughters connect is through story time. Phenomimom... that's fun to say. I am gonna go story that little punk. Sounds good. Louise, you awake, baby? Louise? Louise! Huh? What? What's going on? Sorry. Did I wake you up? Look what I brought. Princess Pigeon Toe... remember? Oh, no. Uh-huh. Not that book. Scootch over. (grunts) Scootch. This is a twin. Come on. There's not a lot of room. Come on, come on. Move, move, move. "Princess Pigeon Toe lived in a peacock castle on Penguin Lane." Please stop, please stop, please stop. "Every day, she went to Parakeet Park to play pinochle with Pauly the Porpoise." Oh, no! Please, just let me sleep! "Sometimes they take a picnic basket full of pickles and peppers and pumpkin pie!" Please make it stop! (squeaking) (bell rings) It's Claire and Jacqueline. Who? The most popular girls at school. How do I look? Oh, good... Hi. I'm Tina. I'll be your server today, and hopefully in the future, your good friend. That's nice. I'll have a cheeseburger. Me, too. Okay, two cheeseburgers... Claire, did you see Rachel's legs? They are so hairy. Oh, my God, I know... so gross. Right? Get a razor, girl. More like a lawnmower. (both laughing) Yeah-oh! (gasps) When did you get there? What'd you say? Nothing. Gene, hide my legs. On it! (grunting) Nothing to see here. This is just how we walk in the restaurant biz. Linda: Aw. My teeny Tina's growing up. With her little leg hairs. Just shave up to the knee. Only strippers shave above the knee. The good ones anyway. Okay. Louise: Um... who did this? I did. Oh, you did? Yes. Oh, what a surprise. Well, you left it in my room. Yeah, the Phenomi... I mean, I think it's important to create tangible expressions of our relationship. Oh, well, isn't that... Whoops. Hey, you hang that up in your room. You know you're gonna need your mother someday. Who's gonna shave your legs, huh? No one... I'm gonna grow them out all long and scraggily. (grunts) I want to look like a torso on two tumbleweeds. (laughs) And I'm gonna learn about s*x from television, so I don't need that from you, either! (grunts) Wait, maybe you should take some time to cool off. Yeah, I don't think you should shave angry. Who's angry? (both yelling) (grumbling) Uh, listen, Lin, do you think you might be forcing it a little? I'm not forcing it, Bob! Right. Louise is gonna see that her best friend is her mommy even if I have to shake it into her. Ow. Shake it, yes, shake it. Stop, no, stop. Like that. (grunts) Ooh, look. No. Yes. No, no, no, no. Yes! Okay, here we go. Going on a little errand, that's all. (groans) We need to talk. Look, I think we should spend some time apart. Mm-hmm, yeah. I'm just not really looking for something serious right now. Sure, sure, honey. You understand... I mean, yeah, it's gonna be a little awkward. You got some of your stuff at my place. We live together... We're here! Laser tag... a little dated, but all right. Not that. That! (screams) I've been kidnapped! No, she hasn't. We're fine. Keep moving. Nothing to see here. Nice blouse. Come on. No, no, no, no, no! Louise, relax. It's not like I'm torturing you. I'm just taking you to an eight-hour mother/daughter seminar. Eight hours?! Yes, our relationship needs help. Professional help. Hey! Start, damn you, start. (both grunting) No! Oh, all right, all right. 20 bucks. What? I'll give you 20 bucks if you come and do this with me. Interesting... $1,000. $28. $29.50. Deal. This is gonna be the hardest money I've ever earned. Unless you become a hooker. (laughs) ? Welcome, everyone. Welcome to my mother/daughter seminar... Modo Time. I'm Dakota. You're the Phenomimom? But you're a man. I am a man. And that's okay. The female spirit flows through all of us. We're all estro-geniuses. Everybody stand up and say it, "I am an estro-genius." All: I am an estro-genius. Oh, dear. Guys, today we are going back. We're gonna go all the way back to the womb. We're gonna get into a womb-a-tism! A what? A womb-a-tism! Ooh, a what? (grunts) No. Hi. Sorry we're late. Ooh, a male daughter. Ha-ha, Logan. Oh, God, it's here. Sorry, this was the only seminar available, and we had an incident yesterday. Logan called me the "B" word. Why must that word exist? Question. What's the "uter-room?" Well, I'm hoping what's in that room won't be necessary. Now, let Modo Time begin! Dad, I want you to drop everything you're doing and shave my legs. I'll take care of the first part. Gene. I was trying to help. Uh, Tina, can't you just shave them yourself? I tried. Oh, God! Aah! Oh, oh, dear. Oh... oh, my... aah! No more razors for you. Just wait for Mom. You wait for Mom. If I don't shave this before school tomorrow, Claire and Jacqueline might talk about me at some restaurant. All right, fine. Like a seafood restaurant or a Chinese restaurant. Tina. Or that rain forest restaurant with all the jungle sounds. Or McCormick and Schmidt's. I said I'll do it. Oh, okay, thanks. There was a time when you got all you needed from your mother through a single cord. Mothers, please strap your symbolic umbilical cords to your daughters' faces. I call them "umbilitators." That's not how umbilical cords work. Here we go... wee-ooh! It doesn't make any sense. And feed those fetuses. Down the hatch. Louise, open your mouth. Louise, open your mouth. Uh-uh. Yeah, she's fine. We're fine. Yes, open that fetus mouth! (laughs) Oh, it's fun. Money. What? Money, no... no more extorting me. Mm-hmm. Okay, fine. Five bucks... now, swallow. Mmm, oh, she loves it. (hacks) Aw. Oh, hello. You must be here for our back waxing special. Um, no. Arm waxing? No. Scrotal waxing? No... what? No! Yeah, that one. No, no, not that one. Yes. Gene, stop. You need it. Gene, shut up. My daughter needs to get her legs waxed. Hi. Oh. (laughs) Phew. I mean, not that I don't want to wax you... but no, I have my limits. Okay, well, you don't have to be rude. Why don't we just take you in the back, sweetheart? It's your job, you know. I'd wax you, Dad. Thanks, Gene. Time to be born. This is disgusting. You sound just like your father. Louise, come to Mama. Oh, no, I think I'm good, thank you. Can I get some scissors, Dakota? Do a little C-section? Those vagisacks cost $50, so... no. Speaking of money. (groans) Here. Someone's dilating. There she is. And time to swaddle the baby. No, no, no, no, no, no, no... oh, God. Snug it up, now, snug it up. No. I shaved that part. You must have been very determined. Thank you. Okay, here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna put the hot wax on your legs. Uh-huh. And then we put these strips on your legs and pull them off. Uh-huh. And it kind of hurts. Uh-huh-ah. A lot. Dad! I don't know if I can do this. Dad, you have to do it with me. What? No, no way. Yes, it's like when you got that flu sh*t to show me it was okay. Yeah, that was brave of me, but... Please? I know I act tough, but I'm not. (crying) Oh, my God... the crying. Okay, I'll do it. Yay, scrotal wax. No, Gene, not scrotal, just leg. Oh, boo! Okay, everybody, role reversal. Louise, you're Linda now. And you're trying to get your defiant daughter Louise to clean her room. Action. (quietly): Role play's gonna cost you big. (hushed): I'll pay for it when I see it. (clears throat) Hello. I'm Linda. ♪ And I want you to clean your room ♪
♪ So I'm singing this song. ♪
♪ But I'm not gonna clean my room, la-la la-la la-la. ♪ No-no-no-no. No singing. Wha...? I'm doing you. That's why I'm singing. You're doing me, so you don't sing. Oh, like I'm not gonna sing! ♪ Oh, you better clean your room ♪
♪ I will never clean my room ♪
♪ 'Cause I'm singing this song ♪
♪ 'Cause I'm so rebellious! ♪
♪ And you're gonna clean your room! ♪
♪ No, I'm not gonna stop! ♪ Okay, you two are done. Big hand for Linda and Louise. Please sit down. Great. You blew it. I blew it? You gave me nothing out there! Well, nothing is what you're getting paid for that! Whoa. Time out. Linda, have you been paying your daughter to be here? I'm sorry, Dakota, but it's the only way she'd do it. (sobbing): I'm a terrible mother. Oh, Linda, you really, really are. Everybody, everybody, listen, okay? Linda is a good mother. Mwa. Because she did it out of love. And that puts you in the running for the Most Valuable Mommy award... the MVM, everybody... which I give out at the end of the day. All right! MVM! Pshh... And as for you, I don't feel like you're taking Modo Time seriously. Oh, no, not at all. And that makes me feel negatively towards you. Well, maybe this will help clear things up. Here's your seminar. See it? It's so cute and nice in my hand, and... (blows raspberry) Did you just fart on my seminar? Ye, me, too! (blows raspberry) Okay, that's... that's fine. I think I know what we need to do here. Hey! Watch it! Get off me! You two will stay in there until you're ready to engage in this experience! Oh, almost forgot. Oh, God. What is that? It's Freaky Friday on a loop. Mom, you're old. And you're young! Wouldn't it be crazy if we switched bodies? Both: No...! (both screaming) No...! (all screaming) Oh-hoo-hoo! Oh, no, we switched bodies! What a crazy journey we are on. The logic of this movie is very unsettling! You can't do this, you monsters! All right, well, why don't you two pair up now that your children are locked away? Of course, Dakota. Come on, Cynthia. Let's you and me learn some mommy skills together. I'd like that, Linda. Dakota: And don't forget about that Most Valuable Mommy award, everybody. It's a beautiful sash. Huh. Huh. Hmm. Hmm. (grunts) Ah. I want that sash. Over my dead body. I want that sash. I love sashes. (both growl) My legs are so free. Mmm. So that's what air feels like. It's nice. (grunts) Yeah, these pants feel incredible. Why don't all men do this? Hmph! Gene, why are you making noises? They're my jealousy noises! Ugh! What are you saying? I want to wax my legs, too! These ones right here! You don't even have leg hair. Tell that to my heart! Hold on, everybody. We're making a U-turn. All right! Ow! Gentle touch, Cynthia. A mother's gentle touch. I'm so sorry. You know, Dakota, when I braid Louise's hair, I sing her a song. Ah, yes, please. ♪ Here goes the hair and there goes the hair ♪ 

  Ah... ♪ And where is Harry Truman? ♪
♪ He's dead in the ground, he's dead in the ground ♪
♪ He's dead, dead, dead... ♪ Ow! Ow! ♪ Well we switched bodies again, and everything's back to normal. I finally understand you, Mom. Freaky Friday's getting to me, man. They really understand each other! You pull yourself together. We got to get out of here. They just had to see things from each other's perspective. Logan, come on! We got to think! Walk a mile in each other's shoes... Oh, I swear to God, if you keep talking, I'm gonna gut-punch you! It's a beautiful story of love and acceptance. Oh, my stomach! Wait a minute. That's it! Wow. See? What'd I tell you? That is smooth. Whoa, whoa, Teddy. What, a little high up on the leg? Yeah. Sorry. There's a stop sign right here. Now feel mine. And mine. No, Teddy, don't touch their legs. Look at this. Whoa! You could wash a pan with that. Hey, maybe I'll sh**t over there and get what you got. Yeah. Nah, on second thought, I couldn't get rid of these little guys. They're my little furry friends. Don't listen to him. You're an embarrassment! No, don't listen to him. You're all right. Furry little... friends? (high-pitched voices): This is fun! Higher, Tina! Higher! (high-pitched screaming) Watch out for that bear! Whoo! Here comes a puma! (yowls) Louise: Mommy! Mommy! Logan: Mommy! Did you hear that, everybody? They're coming around. The Uter-Room is working! Oh, that umbilical soup got me, Mom. Got me real bad. Rub my tummy? Mine, too. Oh, my poor baby. (baby talk) It's wonderful. A mother's instinct at its most primal level! Come, other mothers, come and see! Mommy's gonna make you all better. Well, this mommy's gonna make you all better first. (both grunting) Now! Ha! What the hell's going on? Uh, what are... what are you doing? You fell for the oldest trick in the book. The fake tummy ache! The old belly bluff. Oh, the belly bluff! Now, if you'll excuse us, us girls... (clears throat) Sorry. Ladies... Thank you. Are going to play laser tag. Whoo-hoo! Linda: Oh, I hope those lasers hit you right in the butt! (Dakota grunting) Come on, you! Damn these delicate shoulders! Let me try. (grunts) Where'd you learn how to break down a door, Girl Scout camp? Move it. (both grunting) Announcer: No covering your sensors. No climbing on the barriers. And no physical contact of any kind. Well, agree to disagree. I feel kind of bad about locking our moms in that room. (laser trills) Ah, hey! Tina: I k*lled them. I k*lled them all. Tina, what... what's wrong? I k*lled my friendly leg hairs. Um... oh. Well, they'll grow back. It's not just that. I did it 'cause I was worried about what those girls would think of me. I'm a sheep! A hairless sheep! So you gave in to peer pressure. It happens to everybody. I mean, why do you think I wear these shoes? 'Cause you don't care what you look like? What? No. 'Cause I... No. 'Cause I saw some other chefs wearing them and I thought they were cool. Don't you think? Yeah, yeah. What do you mean? I think they're... Yeah, they're cool. Um... okay. Well, because if they don't look... if they look stupid, I won't wear them. No, they... Yeah. Forget it. Listen. Leg hair or no leg hair, you're still Tina, and when it comes to the important stuff, you'll make the right choice. Gene, put some pants on. No! Ugh. (lasers g*ns whooshing and whirring) What the hell? How'd you get out? I busted through the door. Um, we busted through the door. Fine. My shoulder and Cynthia's left boob. All right, everybody. Fun's over. Now, let's get back on Modo Time. Oh, no freaking way! You are coming back to the Nurture Center right now! You're in big trouble, Logan Berry Bush. Huh? Logan Berry Bush? We didn't think it through. Okay, everybody, calm down. Now, how do we get down there? No one goes in without a vest and a laser g*n. Well, that's not happening. I'll go down there! Linda, no! Laser tag goes against everything we've been working on. And besides... you're mothers. Uh-huh. Where's mommy's g*n?! So, welcome to the war. Okay, first, uh... let's just try to create a dialogue, and we'll... (Dakota shrieks) You're gonna get it, Miss Missy! Why don't you let your g*n do the talking, blabbermouth! Blabbermouth? (grunts) Linda, this isn't right! Feels pretty good to me! I am ordering you to put down your g*n and go cradle your daughter! No! I'm gonna sh**t her instead! Ha! Gotcha! I gave you that one! Nah! This is seriously hurting your chances of receiving the MVM award! Maybe I should give the sash to Cynthia, huh? Die, Logan! Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa, seriously? I'm the MVM? What?! The sash! Oh! That's for kidnapping me! Ooh! Aah! And that's for taking me to The Momgina Monologues! You almost k*lled your mother. I hope you're happy. I am. Any last words? Yes. I just wish... I just wish you liked me, that's all. But I guess you never will, so go ahead, put me out of my misery. Is this all 'cause you think I don't like you? Go on. Just do it. Just go. Take me out. Go ahead. (sighs) Mom, I guess I've been kind of a "B" word today. You have. But I came on a little strong. I'm sorr... You! You ruined my beautiful seminar, you little brat! And now you're gonna pay! (screams) Aah! No! My baby! Suck on this soup tube, Dakota! It's laser-flavored! Mom, nice! (grunts) (panting) Linda: Look north, Dakota. Whoa, Mom, amazing! Make my day! No, no, better before. Wait, wait. Hold on. (gasping) Hey, get off the equipment! Oh, shove it! I'm bonding with my daughter! Yeah, we're bonding here! Best therapy ever. You should have seen the way Mom took down Dakota. Phenomimom, my ass. My ass, too! Up high! Yeah, that my girl! Quit scratching, you two. Can't help it. It itches. Yeah, mine, too. Switch? Okay. Come on. Scratch like a man! Give it to me! Tina, I'm sorry I wasn't there to give you your first shave. It's okay. I regretted it anyway. But it was fun going to the waxing salon with Dad. He's a screamer. Ow, Gene! Not so hard! Aw, man! Your day sounds better. What? I want to go shave my legs with Dad and then regret it. Yeah, let's make all the same mistakes with Dad again tomorrow! Okay. Yay, Dad. Oh, screw all of you. Ah, Mom. Come here.
Hugo: Will the burger be hot enough? Hot enough to k*ll the deadly bacteria? Or is it so cool that I will shut you down? One sixty-three, one sixty-four... One sixty-five. Hot patty. It's safe. Damn it! Yay! Yay! Grade-A ground beef. Meaning we dropped it on the ground. Louise. Are we done here, Hugo? Almost. There's just the little matter of your handwashing certification. I don't see it prominently displayed anywhere. Come on, nobody needs to be certified in handwashing. Yeah! Hands off my hands, government! If you wish to remain open, you will attend a one day seminar exploring the 32 steps of proper hand sanitation. I'm not taking that seminar. Not before you watch the introductory DVD, you're not. Ugh. Come on, Hugo. And here's your "C" rating. Which will remain in your window until you graduate. What?! Hugo, you're an awful man. Uh, wrong, Bob. I'm a "lawful" man. (laughs) Falafel man. Waffle man. Omelettes. Am I doing it right? We should get going, Hugo. Who're you going to harass next, guys? Well, Bob, if you must know, perhaps you've heard our town is now home to a disgusting nude beach? There've been reports of vendors there serving food while n-n... naked. That's how the vendors served food in the Bible. Don't drag religion into this. Sorry. So long, Bob. Get certified or that "C" will stand for "closed." (laughs) Hi. I'm Andre Royo. I played Bubbles on the critically acclaimed series The Wire. Today I'm here to talk about a different kind of bubbles. Soap bubbles. Remember: When washing your hands, do it for the time it takes to count to a thousand. One... two... three... four... (groans) Bobby, when are you and me gonna go to that nude beach that Hugo was talking about? Ugh. Nude beaches are full of overweight, out-of-shape old bodies and I don't want to go there and realize I look exactly like that. I'll go with you, Mom. Mother-daughter nudity day. Fun! I'm pretty sure it's no kids allowed. No kids allowed? Hmm... Look through here and tell me what you see. Tina: It's a cliff. My turn! That's a cliff, all right. Tina, you nailed it! No, it's a cliff that overlooks the nude beach. And if we figure out how to get up there, we could sell tours... nudity tours... to teenage boys. It's like the lnternet, but outside. Yes! Hey, whoa, God! We're not even at the nude beach yet, you. Guess my boobs didn't get the memo. Ha! Linda: It's like we're in Paris. I love it. I know. C'est la vie. Let's go! Whoo! Keep hacking! Come on, guys, we're gonna be the Lewis and Clark of nudism! I'll be the Sacajawea. Of sacks! This is fun! (gasps) You already took your bottoms off! Whoa, whoa! What kind of shape is that? I don't know, it started out to be a triangle, but then I had to do it myself, and then, I don't know... it's like a flower or something. Whoa. Check out the hot guys in the drum circle. Hi. Hey, that looks like... Oh, my God! Bobby, you're not gonna believe this. He was at the nude beach! Wait, who was there? Hugo! Yeah, he was trying to shut the place down. No, he's one of them now. One of what? A nudist! Nudie! He was playing in the waves. (chuckles) Dancing around. He looked like, ah... Madonna in the "Cherish" video. Th-that's not possible. He said he took a leave of absence to be nude. So... Hugo's not our health inspector anymore? Do you know what this means? We're free! Ah! Oh, oh! No more surprise inspections! Ha, ha! No more stupid violations! And I am not going to the handwashing class! Filth! I wash my hands. Unbelievable. Hugo the health inspector is a nudist! I know, can you believe it? Gretchen and I spotted him from across the sands... Out with the bad air, in with the nude air. Don't be embarrassed, Linda. Yes, we were once an item, and true, we never saw each other nude back then... unfortunately... but better late than never. What happened? I thought you were gonna shut this place down. Oh, my investigation? Let's just say what I uncovered in that investigation was my very own soul. Wow. The old Hugo would have seen this man as a health hazard, pure and simple. The new Hugo sees only a man. A nude man selling blondies. Three blondies, please. Whoa, wai... Wha... Where'd you pull that from? My fanny pack. Where's your fanny pack? Oop. Oh-ho! There it is. Well, it kind of makes sense. I mean, the guy was wound so tight he was like a tubby little time b*mb. Teletubby time b*mb. Kids! Come in here! I have amazing news. Can't it wait? We're tired. And rashy. (grunts) Where were you? Bushwacking a trail to the nude overlook. Dad, before you say anything, know that we're gonna come out of this deal stinkin' rich! And we're gonna put a roof over you and Ma. Well, good luck. I'd pay not to have to look at those people. Hey, Dad, whoa, whoa, whoa, rewind. I'd like to hear your amazing news. Everyone, Hugo is not a health inspector anymore. He's a nudist! (door bell jangles) Ron! I think I know why you're here. Go ahead, I'll pretend I haven't heard. It's true. Hugo has taken a leave of absence. We miss him terribly and hope for his speedy return. Ha-ha! Right. All right, well, I'd like you to meet Hugo's replacement. Hey, hello, Tommy Jaronda. Pleasure to meet you. Hi. Uh... what, you're the new Hugo? Well, there's only one Hugo. Yeah, well, I'm here, so let's get into it. Oh, um... listen, Inspector, uh, Jaronda, I know you're just doing your job, but we got inspected two days ago, so... Yeah, yeah, it's cool, Bob. Yeah, yeah, you know what? Call me Tommy. Okay, Tommy. All right. I'm seeing a lot of tickytacky fouls here. What, he made you go to a handwashing seminar? That's some major B.S. Pardon my language, kids. How are you? Hello. No sweat off our ass. Yeah, that Hugo, he kind of had it out for us. Ugh. I-I can't stand inspectors like that. You know? Makes us look like turds. "No one can make you look like a turd without your permission." Eleanor Roosevelt. Ha! This kid's a trip! Funny stuff, funny stuff. You know what? I'm actually, uh... I'm starving. You hungry, Ron-Ton? You mean eat one of Bob's burgers? Hugo would never... Oh, come on, Ron. This guy... (laughs) How tall is this guy? (chuckling): He's pretty tall. The leaning tower of ta... of tall guy. (Bob laughs) I'm giving you a hard time, come here. Hey, Bob, can you grill us up a couple? Um... is this part of the inspection? Uh, yeah, something I like to call the mouth inspection. (laughing) Okay. (continues laughing) Whoa! This is incredible! Wow, first time I ever got a compliment from a health inspector. Bob, question: You like rock? Um, yeah. I like rock... music. Is that what you're talking about? Yes. Okay. You know, I play almost every night over at Pistol McSwish's Basketball and Brew. You should come by. Th-That'd be great. Absolutely. What your burger did to my mouth, my music is gonna do to your ears. (laughs) That's great... (laughs) Come here, come here. All right, all right. Get out of here, man. What are you doing? Yeah, come here. Oh. You got me. What, you punching me? I'm punching you back. I think Dad just got to second base with that guy. What are you doing this weekend, brother? I would like to visit the nude beach and see the naked people. You only live once, right, my sister? Haven't you heard? Kids aren't allowed on the nude beach. No! Unfair, isn't it? Well, what if I told you that you could see the nude beach? Mm! All the dingles... Ooh. All the dongles... Ahh. All for one low price. I want to see the dongles! Hell, yeah! Cocoa-buttered boobies! Sign up here to see the buff from the bluff! Don't be shy... they certainly aren't. Darryl: Hello, Louise. Darryl, you interested? You strike me as more of an indoor nerd. I am interested, but not as a customer... as a key member of your team. For a piece of the action? Oh-ho-ho, is that so? (laughs) It is so. If you're nudie watching from the top of a bluff, I've got something that'll double your money. Basically, this is the Hubble for boobies. I've seen my neighbor across the street put her bra and girdle on hundreds of times. Aren't girdles for old people? They are. And she is. Nice. (panting, grunting with effort) (groans) How come we're doing all the lugging? You're also doing all the yapping. Tina: Nudes, ho! Starting tomorrow, we're gonna be flush with ass-cash. Whatcha doin', Pops? Hitting the streets for some hooch? No, he's off to Pistol McSwish's to see the new health inspector play his rock. I have to go. We want to keep this guy on our side. Tommy! I was just heading out to catch your set... Bob! You're never gonna believe it! That idiot who owns Pistol McSwish's told me I can't play there anymore! What? How come? 'Cause he don't know nothin' about good rock, that's how come. Aw. Wait... Hey, I could play here. Here? Uh, what? Yeah. Nah. Yeah, no. The acoustics in here are not... No. The acoustics in here are great. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, sounds good in here. Oh, clapping. Clapping's fun. Echo. Echo. Stop. Stop. Echo. Echo. Gene, stop. Gene. Ah! Ah! Oh, it's done.

You told him he could play here all week? (quietly): I don't think I did. I did. But this is still way better than dealing with Hugo. You got to say something. What about that song, "Elderly Prostitute"? ♪ Da, da, da, da, da, elderly prostitute ♪
♪ Da, da, da, boo, ba, elderly prostitute... ♪ All right, I'll say something. So, what'd you guys think? Did you like my rock? D'oh. Tommy, that, uh... rocked. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Linda, what'd you think? Ha! Did it speak to you as a lady? Now be honest. It screamed in my face as a lady. Oh, Mom loved it. Sell her a CD. Done. Yeah, listen, Tommy, can I talk to you about something I... Come on, let's go backstage. Let's go. What? Oh. Okay. (door bell jangles) Hmm! WhooMan. What people don't know about rock, it's a very physical... experience, you know? It's-it's very athletic. You're moving around a lot. Yeah, yeah. You noticed that. It's almost like you moved around too much. Yeah, I've gotten all kinds of comments, you know... "you move around a lot," "you seem to be having a hard time." Yeah, I can see that one, a little bit. "You're jumping around for no reason." Right. "You know, your eyes are bulging weird. It's off-putting," this and that... but that's what they said about Queen. Yeah. Did they? Uh, in rock in general. Hey, uh, Tommy, uh... you know, our place is sort of a family restaurant and... some of your songs are a little risqué. So I was thinking, maybe don't... Wait. Hold on a second. Before I forget, I got a little something here for you... it's your inspection file. There's nothing on here. That's right! Clean slate. You're welcome. Wow. Really? Yeah, come on, shut up. Well, thanks, Tommy. Oh, man. I still got all that mojo flowing through me. You know, I-I got to get it out. I'm gonna take this van to the beach and peel off some burnies. You want to come? Um... what's a... wh-what's a burny? (tires screeching, Tommy laughing) (laughing) Ah! Ah, I'm gonna throw up! I want to go home! What? This is fun! Oh, no more burnies! All right, people, line up! You'll see we have many noteworthy specimens on the beach today. Only a dollar to get a closer look at the action. Step right up! Look through this tube, see some boob. Give me the green, see some peen. Hey, this is gross. We came all this way to see old people? Ew! Nasty! You tricked us. I want my money back. Uh-oh. Whoa-whoa, wait, whoa-ho-ho, you guys, you're looking at this the wrong way. You want to see nice bodies?! Get a magazine! This is real, people! Check out that guy. What is that? Is that a liver spot? Is that a birthmark? Is that a third nipple? Who knows? You can't write this crap! Hold up, hold up, hold up. Let me see. I get it. Yeah, I guess, on second look, it's better. This, uh... first song goes pretty deep. It's called "Daddy." Uh... at least it's, uh, uh, a family song. ♪ Daddy! You abandoned me! ♪

  Gene: Hurdles on a beach? What are those silly little skin bags up to now? Wait a second. This can't be. Ow! Uh, guys, you might want to buy seats now, for tomorrow's event. Zeke: "Nudecathlon." That sounds like decathlon, but nude. They're naked and old and they're bringing home the gold! Go! You go talk to him! All right. Tommy, listen, there's something I need to talk to you about. I was thinking, maybe, um... you could take some time off from performing... uh, here. What? What, what are talking about, Bobby boy? It's just that, um... you know, you could be performing at... at way different places. Huh, it's almost like you're saying you don't want me to play here anymore. No. Not... No. You... took that the wrong way. Uh-huh. What I meant was... you're great. Right. Um, but just not maybe for, for here. I'll tell you what's funny, you know, that's what the manager over at Pistol McSwish's said, too. Did he? Yeah, kind of exactly. Oh. And it's a shame about that guy... you know, he got shut down by me. What are you doing? You know, I hate to say this, but, you know, you got rat turds on your floor, man, and, yeah, I-I gotta write that up, unfortunately. What? Tommy, that's crazy. You just carry around bags of rat turds in your pocket? Yeah, I don't know what you're talking about. Yeah, look over... see, I see some more right over here, see? You didn't even empty that one! You're saying a rat just came in here and tossed a bag of its poop on my floor? Yeah, that's a thing that happens. And look, you know, it can all go away. Just let me do an encore, and then come back and play every night. No, Tommy! You're not gonna hold us hostage with your crappy music and your threats! Crappy?! So get out of my restaurant, Tommy! Okay! Of course, you know what this means: Until further notice, you are shut down, my man! Fine! Why don't you get out, my man?! Oh, gladly, my man! Oh, and guess what?! You do have bulging eyes! And it is off-putting! So, uh... h-how did, uh, how'd it go? Great. We're hungry, Bobby! Open up! I can't, Teddy. Tommy closed us down. If I serve you, I could go to jail. We're willing to take that chance! If Tommy doesn't let us open, we'll be broke by next week! We gotta fix this, Bobby! There's only one person who can help us now. Oh, God. Oh, don't be so nervous. It's natural. What's going on here, anyway? Naked field day! Fun! Ugh. Bubbila, bubbila. There he is. I can't believe I'm gonna grovel to a naked Hugo. Bob! Linda! You're just in time to see me excel at nude tetherball! Hugo, look, I've come to ask for your help. The guy who replaced you shut down the restaurant. Oh, Bob, that's a pity. But the health-inspecting world doesn't interest me anymore. Come on. This guy's nuts, Hugo. He, he planted rat poop. You wouldn't even do that. Listen to you, Bob! It's all about things with you! Restaurants! Rat feces! Underwear! Oh, God. Today is the Nudecathlon, so either you join me in nude brotherhood or kindly return to your clothed country. All right, all right. What, what if I did join you? The more the merrier. But what if I competed and beat you? (chuckles) Uh, you won't. But if I did, would you help us out then? Is this some kind of bet, Bob? Yeah. It's a bet. And what do, what do I get if I win? Well, what do you want? You have to cater the Nudecathlon closing ceremony for free. If this is what it takes, this is what it takes. Bob, you do realize what you're getting yourself into. A nudecathlon has 27 events, not including warm-up freeze tag. I quit. No, Bobby, come on! You can do it! (groans) Parlays, exactas, trifectas! We're taking all action, people! Louise, you're gonna want to see this. (wailing groan) (screams) We played with fire, and this is what we get... fire in our eyes! I think Dad looks pretty good, considering he's had three kids. Hey, Dad, stop stretching like that! Oh, my God! (blows whistle) Zeke here, calling the action for you on this sunny afternoon. There can only be one winner today, but many floppy wieners. And they're off! Doughboy's out to an early lead!

(blows whistle) (both grunting) Ah, not there. There you go. (grunts) Take this one. Let go! Sweep the leg, Dad! Sweep the leg! Treat him like a naked piñata, Dad! Break him open for some candy! Okay, Bob, time to do this! Not today, Bob! Oh! The little guy flips the fay little a patty! We've got a pin! No! Yes! I win! You took Linda from me, you were the scourge of my professional life, but this time, I win! (laughing wildly) You can get off me now, Hugo! Never! (laughing): I win! Let's go home, Lin. All right. I win, win, win! Wow. That was rough. Naked and defeated. Just the way he entered this world. Bobby, you put your pants on backwards, honey. Doesn't matter. None of it matters. We lost the restaurant, Lin. Tina, let's put our pants on backwards, too. Let's do it for Dad! I'm wearing a skirt, but okay. (door bell jangles) Hugo? What are you doing here? And why are you wearing clothes? Or is that just body paint? Today, at the beach, you tasted my sweet victory, but I realized something: It wasn't enough. What does that mean? I want to shut you down... I do... not some dirty doody-dropper... me. Until then, you're open for business. Ron? You got it, buddy. All right! Well, thanks, Hugo. All right, everyone! Load in! What's going on? The closing ceremony, Bob. Remember? You have to cater it. Disrobe at will! Don't bother with courtesy tissues on the seats. Gettin' nude for food! I love it! Hold the buns. Am I right?! Well, better clean up the gum under the tables. I'll get to it. Tina, no. I hate you, Hugo. (cackles) Wait... what about Tommy Jaronda?

Lookie, lookie. My green blazer from when I had jury duty on Saint Patrick's Day. What's the blazer for? Tina's gonna wear it at her audition tomorrow for the school news channel. I want to be serious newswoman, like Holly Hunter in Broadcast News. "It must be great being right all the time. No, it's terrible." Aw. I need to practice being a television journalist. Dad, can I interview you? Um, okay. Don't look directly into the camera, Dad. I got it. So, tell me, why burgers? Well, my dad got me started... Do you see this as a stepping stone to a real restaurant? It... is a real restaurant. Mm, slop shop. Can you cook anything other than burgers? Yes, lots of things. Like? Like, um... like, paella. Paella... tell me how you make that. Well, I'd have to look up the recipe, but, uh... So you don't know how to make paella? No, I could make... Okay, I'm confused, because a minute ago you were an expert. Dad needs media coaching. Look, I randomly said "paella." I didn't mean to. Ah, I'm going in tight. Bob, get off paella. All right, interview's over. Get that camera out of my face. I think we got what we need. You look amazing, sweetie. And you're gonna look even better on camera. You inherited my strong chin. Where's your strong chin, Mom? I can't see it. Keep looking, you'll find it. What did I inherit from you, Mom? You got my zest for life. And my extra long pinky toe. And I got your birthing hips. Actually, Gene, you take more after your father. No, hips don't lie. Look at this. I forgot that I went through a Judd Nelson phase. That's your father when he was your age. He looked just like you. (groans) Wait, does that mean when I'm his age, I'm gonna look just like him? Spoiler alert! No! Hey, you could do worse. I don't see how! At least you know your shoulders won't go bald. Gene, it's starting. I found this on your pillow! Ah! Oh, my God! Quick, come me over! Trump me! Louise... What? You're not going bald, Gene. Apologize, Louise. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. (scissors snipping) It's okay. What's the point of clinging to this, if I'm doomed to be that? Huh. I don't know. Lin. Why wait? Let's do it now. I want the whole Bob. Male-pattern baldness. Hmm. Stoop shoulders. Stop. Paunch. Please. And the push broom on my lip. This is incredibly insulting. Think about how I feel. You really let myself go. Go to school. We're going. Bye. Remember, kids, this is just the student news, no pressure. I'll only be going back frame by frame and critiquing you on eye contact, presentation and how cool you are. You really want to do this? (sighs) Okay, first up to the green screen, Zeke with sports. Comin' at ya, Mr. Grant! That game was tighter than a tater in a tailpipe. It was like two babies climbin' on the same boob. Then we lost. Wow, Zeke, I feel like I was there. Next up, auditioning for field reporters, Andy and Ollie. Back to you, Andy. Back to you, Ollie. Back to you, Andy. Back to you, Ollie. If only you two were Siamese twins. We can do that. Oh, great! (grunting) That'd be super helpful if you could figure that out. It looks like it's working. We did it! So sweet. And, next up, for the coveted anchor spot, Tammy. Good luck, Tammy. Uh, I was born lucky, Tina. 'Cause I was born me and not you. And I'm a blonde now, so I'm better than you. (scoffs) I don't like what you say, but I admire the way you say it. Wow, it's Tammy with the news! Whoo! ♪ News... News. Tam, slam, thank you, ma'am. Next up, Tina. Oh, hey, Tina, little tip: You're a super fast talker, so talk really slow. Thanks, Tammy. Whoa! That's still way too fast. Mr. Grant, I'm here because I have a nose for news. Great. Now about that green jacket... I'm Tina with... (whispers): Tina. ... with... the... (screams) Paranormal activity! (screams) Oh, my God, I'm anchor! Yes! Yes! ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ (sings guitar riff) Whoo! I am anchor! I'm staff intern? But I already had a sign-off. "Good-bye, audience." Well, maybe you could change it to "Does anyone need juice?" Does anyone need juice? Hmm. Maybe it'll work better when you have some juice. So, what does the staff intern do? Besides go on juice box runs? Yeah. Oh, lots of things. You know, hand out the juice, make sure people are happy with their juice, clean up all the empty juice boxes. Okay. Isn't there any other important behind-the-scenes stuff I could do to help? Well, there's editing music, effects. That stuff is a blast. Great. But I do those. I mean, if you did them, what would I do? Be the teacher? Yeah, right, Tina, that sounds great. I'll just teach. (sighs) Little more off the top. Sprinkle on the back and the ears. A little more glue. ♪ Buh, buh, buh, buh Show me, show me! ♪ VoilÃ ! It's perfect! I've been tarred and Bobbed. I don't know how I got that arm hair to look so sad, but I did it. Can I get in here? I need to... Oh, my God! It's like looking in a mirror! No, it isn't, Gene. Who's Gene? I already can't tell who's who. Take that stuff off. Lin, get in here and settle this! Don't call your mother Lin. What? Oh! Wha... h-hey! Whoa, travel-size Bob. Aw. Linda, you're encouraging him. I need the bathroom. Oh. Wow, this is confusing. No, it's not. You're my family and I love you, but you're terrible. You're all terrible. I don't say that. Well, that's all you say. You do. You kind of do. Bob and Gene: Unbelievable. Gene. Bob. All right, enough. Enough. I'm not doing this. Yes, you are. No, I'm... oh, my God. Oh, God. He's really good. He's good. He's not good, Lin. He's not good, Lin. He's good. Gene! What, Bob?! Lin! Lin! What? Gene! Lin! Lin! Gene! I'm leaving! Aw, he's so cute. Stop following me! Stop following me in front! Hi, Mr. Branca. Careful, Tina. Slippery. (gasps) Did Mrs. Persky's water break? I may have won the baby pool. Worse. Someone dragged in a dog turd. And this isn't the first time, either. You have great stories, Mr. Branca. I ever tell you you're, like, my best friend? Oh. Thank you. Look, this news show competes for students' attention with cell phones, gossip and bathroom graffiti. We need to be faster, meaner, and graffiti-er! So, what I'm... I have a cran-apple, two grapes and a bunch of kiwi-strawberry. Here's the crazy straw you asked for, Zeke. Extra crazy, just how you like it. Could be crazier. Now, who knows the five W's of school news? Oh, "who, what, where, when and sometimes why." Or, is that vowels? No! They're "wow, woo-hoo, way hot, weird and what the mmm." Every story we do should have all five. I got one: New kid nip slips! Way hot, Zeke! Oh, whose parents are poor? Woo-hoo, Tammy! I've got one. The custodian says someone is tracking in dog poo. What the huh? Less caca, more gaga, Tina. Anyone else? I hear there's a 45-year-old fourth grader with a mustache walking around school. Now that's pretty "what the ah"! Go with that. Zeke: This is WSN, the news you need from the students you like. In your face! I'm Tammy Larson and these are the breaking stories. What's up with Brenda? I mean, right? Jimmy Pesto Junior previews dance moves the principal won't allow at winter prom. This one's out. Can't do this. Forget about this one. (grunts) I love it, but it's not news. Now, to our top story: Lenny Destefano... is there enough of him to go around, and how can we ration our passion? Jocelyn, who's Lenny going to the winter prom with? No one knows. He's going out with Julie, but he's been texting the entire drill team and me. And me, also. Jocelyn: Oh. Now to Zeke with dodgeball highlights. Thanks, Tammy! Here's a kid getting it in the muchachos. Ooh! Here's another dude, right in the Easter eggs. Boing! Watch this geezer with a 'stache get his. (grunts) It's okay, I've had my kids. Hey, Tina, I saw the news. Is that true about Lenny and the drill team? Julie deserves better. The school deserves better news. Well, I just got back from the library. More shoe poopy got dragged in up there. All the way to the reference section. Talk about Encyclopedia Brown. (laughs) I... I don't get it. Wait, that's a pretty long way to track something in on a shoe. I'm gonna poke around. Something doesn't smell right. That's this. Oh, yeah. So it is applesauce, but try to find it in the sauce aisle at the supermarket. You'll be sorely disappointed. Anyway, I was looking for chutney. Uh, is this a long story, Teddy? I mean, it has been long, but is it longer? I haven't gotten to the story part yet. Gene, I need you behind the counter. Just stand here and I'll be right back. I'm not sure I appreciate being foisted off like this, Bob. So, anyway, I end up in the ethnic food section. Mm-hmm. It was like a whole new world opened up. Mm-hmm. I bought baby food from lndia. Those babies are tough. No joke on those slices. That's fascinating, Teddy. Little Bob is great. Yeah, I guess I'll keep him. (laughs) Lin, stop. You stop. No, stop, Lin. No, you stop, little Bobby. Mm-hmm, stop. Bobby, stop. Look at you two, you're like an old married couple. We put up with each other. All right, enough, Gene. Gene, get back to the kitchen. How could dog poop make it all the way up two flights of stairs and into the library on a shoe without being wiped off? Tele-poop-tation? Let's experiment. We need something the exact same size and texture as poop. How about Dad's burger? It's even the same color! Great idea. (both making fart noises) What the hell are you kids doing? Walking on one of Dad's burgers to see how much like dog doo it is. Oh, science. It's clean. That can mean only one thing: The poos must have come from inside the school. Which means, they're probably human! I knew there was a story there. We're looking at a serial pooper. Oh, my God. Is it you, Louise? I've dabbled in the area, but I don't get enough food to be a serial pooper. I, uh, probably only poop once a week. I think I'll call the culprit the Mad Pooper. Ooh, I got a better one. The Butt-ler. Get it? I get it. It's got "butt" in it. (laughs, makes fart noise) Butt. Whatever we call him or her, it's definitely news. Mr. Grant: That's toilet journalism, Tina. We do gutter journalism. But there's a Mad Pooper loose in the school. It's the job of the news to inform the public. It's worth it, even if we save just one shoe. Yuck. Well said, Tammy. (sighs) The Mad Pooper story is ten times bigger than Lenny Destefano's love life. And less disgusting. He'll put his lips on anything with pom-poms. But I can't get it out there. WSN has a news monopoly. So do your own newscast. My own newscast? You think I could do that? Who's the one yammering about her nose for news? Me? Yeah, this nose right here! Ow! Get it sniffing! Snort some news up there! I can't snort 'cause you're holding my nose. There's gonna be lots of things holding you back! Okay. Snort it up! Come on, Cronkite, snort! It's for the good of the people! Let me know when you got something. (girl screams) My diorama... got diarrheaed. I think I just snorted a story. Dad's old camcorder, a VCR and a videotape? Say hello to your state-of-the-art studio. But, this is Gene's birth. There's a lot of crowning stuff that can just be taped over. Looks like an angry softball trying to get out of a coin purse. Hmm, okay. Listen, princess, I don't even know what you're talking about, but you can do anything you set your mind to. And, no matter what, your mother and I will always love you. He's good. That kid just fathered the crap out of you. He did... okay. I did great. Little preachy. You got a lot of shine on you, Tina. (coughing) How did you get equal time on the school network? I told Principal Spoors I had incriminating pictures of him. Because I drew some incriminating pictures of him. Great, let's do this. These halls are calm now. But on Wednesday, it was a different story. I left my shoebox diorama for a minute and someone pooped in it. It was about the Industrial Revolution. (crying) Some call him the Mad Pooper. My mom calls him the Butt-ler. By any name, these brown thumbtacks tell a tale of terror. Excuse me, can I go get my medicine at the nurse's office? Shh. I'm watching this. Oh. Oh, no. Who would do such a thing? We turn to an expert, Mr. Frond. It's someone trying to communicate. Likely, a foreign- exchange student. He or she has something inside them they desperately want to get out. Rage? Poo. And what do Wagstaff students think? My message to the Mad Pooper is: Grow up! I did. Whoever the Mad Pooper is, he or she is probably not finished. And if they're not, I'm not. In the hall, I'm Tina Belcher. Louise: And we're clear. Yes, I did it. Take that, Tammy. And Holly Hunter. Louise: I lied, we're not clear. Okay, now we're clear. I'll just edit that part out. Oh, okay, good. ♪ 

  (blowing air) (dull splat) Ah, damn it, we got poop-scooped! Tina's story is all anyone's talking about. Tammy, what happened? Well, you said gaga, not caca. This caca is gaga! Now get me that story. I don't know how. Do it, or I'll replace you with the weird twins. Back to you, Andy! Back to you, Ollie! Whoa, okay, no, no, no! Forget it. Hey, Tina, great Mad Pooper reporting. Thanks. Can I copy you like I do in math class? Real news isn't about copying. And you shouldn't copy me in math. Yeah, well, you should get a tutor, 'cause I got a "C." You got a "C"? Wait, I got a "D." You know what? I'll do my own story. And it'll be way better than yours, you lame-pon. Good, I hope it is. It will be. Because then we'll have more information about the Mad Pooper... Tina, we're trash-talking; Stop turning it into a normal conversation. Oh. Sorry. Um, skank? That's much better! Uh, I hate your new hair color. Give it to me! Your eye shadow is a little much. In the face! My face! Our top story: Is Tina the Mad Pooper? What if actual surveillance footage existed showing Tina in the act? Let's go to a reenactment of what that footage might look like. She was always so quiet. Yeah, she kept to herself. Yeah, she did. She did. So, did Tina create the very story she reported on? Mr. Grant is here to comment. When Tina auditioned, frankly, I was physically afraid of her ambition. She would've done anything to get on TV. And now, apparently, she has. Ah. And what if WSN had an exclusive video confession? Me... Tina... are... Mad... Pooper. You don't believe that just because it was on TV, right? Got it. Tina? Principal's office, now. (kids gasping, murmuring) I didn't do it. Follow the money. I'll take a poop detector test. Poop on me once, shame on you. Poop on me twice, we're not best friends anymore! It's not me, it was a reenactment. If it didn't happen, then how could they reenact it? Huh. Uh, yeah. Oh, you should be a teacher instead of secretary, Ms. Schnur. I know. Louise, why are you here? Tammy didn't frame you. Unrelated charge. And now we wait. At least you're guilty of something. I got framed. Cry to Principal Spoors when he gets back from the anti-smoking assembly. (gasps) Oh, my God, the assembly! The whole school is there. Can you think of a better place for the Mad Pooper to strike? The Super Bowl, American ldol, Westminster Dog Show, upside-down roller coaster, International Space Station, yoga retreat, inside a T-shirt g*n... If I could just get out of here, I could clear my name. I'll take care of Ms. Schnur. Oh, no, look, they're towing a high-mileage, smallish car with a bumper sticker about a personal passion maybe? "My other car's a cat"? That's the one! No! I hope Ms. Schnur's car's okay. Go, Tina! Oh, yeah. All right, missy, this better be good. Louise, where's your sister? Tina's not here, Gene. Don't you sass me! Hey, I don't even let Dad talk to me like that. (panting): We got here as soon as we could. Gene, what are you doing here? They called me! No, they called me. I can't believe my daughter is the Butt-ler. I have no daughter! Oh, don't say that, Gene. Yes, he should say that. Come on, she's down at the assembly trying to clear her name. (sighs) Our lives were so much simpler before the rug rats. We use to see movies... Lin! Sorry, but it's true. (applause) Cigarettes are the real devil sticks. Nicotine is a bad scene. You're here somewhere, Mad Pooper. Let's stay focused; We got to find Tin... Ooh, jugglers! Hey, can I get a light? Sure, smoke 'em if you got 'em. This is kind of a weird message. I really want a cigarette. I really want to juggle. No sign? Nothing. Oh, my God, look. The Pooper. I need to get up there. But how? You could use that hydraulic scissor lift. Perfect. I'll sneak up on him. I'll be as quiet as a mouse. Kelly Mathis and Jocelyn are wearing the same scrunchie. But Jocelyn is definitely wearing it better. Mr. Grant, look. It's Tina. What's she doing up there? Maybe she is the Mad Pooper. Hey, we're better than we thought. Let's get that camera. Yeah, catch her in the act. On the big screen! That's a big load of news. Look, everyone! It's the Mad Pooper! (screams) Ah, it's Tina! Tina, what are you doing? Get down! (crowd gasps) Oh, my God! Come out of the shadows, Mad Pooper. (crowd gasps) Zeke? Surprised? Zeke's the Butt-ler! Why'd you do it, Zeke? Well, the first time was an accident. But the second time was for fun. Then accident, fun, fun, another accident, three funs in a row, then after that, I was doing it for you, Tina. Aw. Aw. But now it's over. It's not over. I got one left! Zeke, no. (chanting): Poop! Poop! Poop! Crowd (chanting): Poop! Poop! Poop! Poop! Poop! Stupid kids, listen to them. Poop's not funny. I mean, it is a little, but what sort of message are we... I can't stand it! I want to see him poop! I want to be a kid again! Poop! Poop! Poop! Oh, thank God. He's back. Aw, I'll miss my Muppet Baby Bobby. You don't have to do this. Poop! Poop! Poop! Poop! Here we go. (grunts) This isn't an accident! No, it is, it is. (grunting): Oh, God. Oh, boy. It's taking a long time. It's a girl! Uh, no, it's a boy! I guess we're really watching this. Bobby, hold my hand. Get out of there! No! (sighs) Tammy, look out! (slow-motion): No...! Our top story: The Mad Pooper almost nails me. I'm joined by the girl who saved my hair. Louise, it was so close. I thought it was going to be a lot closer, Tammy, to be honest. But I miscalculated. Wind, maybe. I was scared there was gonna be poop right into my mouth. Let's go to the Mad Pooper himself, Zeke, who, incredibly, is not in trouble. Let's find out why. My family moves around a lot. His family moves around a lot. Uh, WSN would like to apologize for any inadvertent suggestion that Tina Belcher was the Mad Pooper. Our bad. And now, a new WSN feature: The Tina Table. Is it getting hot in here? One study shows the school nurse's thermometer is off by one degree. She's here to discuss it. Later, I'll talk to students about trading snacks at lunch. Is it insider trading? No, it isn't. Look at my news girl, her pretty head floating like a balloon. Is it just me, or does Tina look great without a torso? Wonder how'd she look with a mustache and a bald spot? Oh, I just remembered how to make paella.
(thunder rumbling) Linda: Happy Valentine's Day to all my loves. Smooches. Everyone gets a smooch. (kissing sounds) Oh, give Gene mine. I'll take it. (kissing sounds) I hope a certain wife is ready to be romanced. Huh? Oh. Oh, Bobby. A pancake shaped like a heart. Wow. We got the rejects. Mine looks like a moustache. Pancake rides, five cents. I can't see what mine looks like, but it feels ear-shaped maybe? What you doing under the table, you silly? Hiding. I-I mean I'm not here so I can't go to school. But it's Valentine's Day. You love Valentine's Day. Until the St. Valentine's Day disaster last year. What? I'm talking about Jimmy Jr.'s Valentine card. Here, Tina. "From"? No...! My heart was m*rder*d by the word "from." No one says "I from you." I'm not going to school today. If Tina's not going, I'm not going. Scoot over. Yeah, we made a pact. Everybody out from under there. You're all going to school. Gene: No. Yes. There's a lot of learning to do down here. What's under there? Wouldn't you like to know? Come on, it's raining, I'll give you a ride. ♪ Buckle it up, buckle it up ♪
♪ Buckle it up or you'll die. ♪ So? I'd say I knocked it out of the park with your mother this year. Mm, more like a swing and a miss. Heart-shaped pancakes is just as bad as a "from." No, it isn't. You do the same thing every year, Dad. You need to mix it up. Yeah. What? I mix it up. I mean, I stick to a central theme, hearts, but your mom loves them. Yeah, she never gets tired of them. Huh? Mmm... Huh? Oh... Well? Mm... (groans) Hmm. Grow up, Dad. Only kids get to make homemade gifts. She deserves something nice this year. Mom's a real keeper. She's okay. Teddy: So, Lin, did Bob make another last-minute heart-shaped thing this year? Flapjacks. Oh. Oh. Ah, it's all right. Valentine's Day isn't about valentines. It's about two people being in love. ♪ Two people ♪

I'm gonna find love for both of you today. We are gonna do speed dating. All right. I could go for that. I'm in. I'll make a sign. Oh, this is gonna be fun. Bob: Okay, so what do you think your mom wants-- chocolates? Perfume? We don't think what Mom wants. We know what Mom wants. Great, what does she want? A Grazielda figurine. Oh, yeah, those porcelain thingies. Okay, I'll-I'll get one of those. Thanks. All right, have a good day, kids. Dad, there are hundreds of Grazieldas, thousands maybe. Taking our jobs, marrying our women. Only we know the exact one Mom wants. Yeah, if you pick the wrong one, it's like you got her nothing! Okay, so tell me-- which one is it? We'll tell you... at the mall. Yeah, we should go to the mall. My heart will be safe from Jimmy Jr. there. Hey, I'm not taking you out of school to go to the mall. Okay, well, you know, it's your marriage. (knock on window) You're holding up the line. Hold on, one minute. Hmm, I could stand to wow her. (horns honking) Then wow the woman. Stop, I'm... wait! Come on, move it! You move it! I'm saying good-bye to my kids! (groans) You're sure you know? I know. All right, we're going to the mall then! (whoops) To the mall! Yeah! Okay.

Bob: Hmm. Shingles. Uh, yeah, that's good, fine. Bob: Wow, these are all so corny. Louise: What's so corny about a puppy under an umbrella? (Bob groans) All right, so which one does your mom want? That one! That one! That one? That one. Wait a second, you have no clue which one your mom wants-- you just tricked me to get out of school. How dare you! I believed them, too, Dad. Egg on our face, huh? Let me guess-- looking for a Grazielda for your lovely wife? Yeah, so which one is the least expensive? Oh, this is kind of our starter figurine-- La Princessa. She's $250. What? That's your cheapest? I don't like that word. Perhaps you nor your wife are really serious about Grazieldas. No, we're not. Who would be serious about these things? Bill Belichick, Peter Frampton, Linda Lavin to name a few. Kids, we're leaving. Linda: Welcome, ladies, to Bob's Burgers' Speed Dating. You'll have one minute with these fine gentlemen, and when you hear this-- Kank-kank-- switch partners. But if you hear this-- cra-cra-crank-- change topics. And who's ready to fall in love? (watch beeps) Speed date. So, Teddy, this is Gina. You two are now in pre-love. We are? Well, you got 60 seconds to figure it out. So, ticktock, let's go. Uh, I'm Teddy, like Linda said earlier. Um, what do we talk about? Uh, I don't know. What do we talk about? I want to lick this one like an envelope, mmm. Great, mail jokes. (laughs) Oh, you're a mailman. Kids, how about this cell phone cover? It says, "Got Milf." That's perfect, right? For your mom? I'll get this and then I'll bring you kids back to school. School? Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Dad, you need to wow her. This is not gonna wow her. I thought you were done half-assing it, Dad. Why can't you be more romantic? What? I'm plenty romantic. Very funny. Stop goofing. What was the most romantic thing you ever did for Mom? I don't know, I planned stuff. I planned a whole romantic day one time. It was her birthday... No, wait, it was my birthday... No, no, no, wait, it was Valentine's Day. It was our first Valentine's Day together. Gene: You are the worst storyteller. Where's Maya Angelou when you need him? Bob: Yeah, I made a picnic basket and I picked out a spot to watch the sunset, and then my car died. So we had to get towed to the mechanic's. Tell me exactly what was wrong with the car-- was it a gasket? Was it the carburetor? Tina: Guys, he's telling us a romantic story. Bob: While the car was getting fixed, we went to a bar across the street. It wasn't the beach at sunset, but we, uh, we had a great time. Tina: Aw. And there was this old beat-up machine, like a love tester or something, and we squeezed the lever together, and it said we were "red hot." And she kissed me and that's, uh, that's when I knew we were in love. That's it. Buy Mom the love tester. What do you mean, the actual machine? Yeah, she'd totally marry you if you did that. Dad, do you remember where that bar is? Will it take all day to find it? Hmm, I do think I remember where it is. Oh, really? We've got a mission. The most noble mission there is-- a love mission. It's a missionary position mission. Yeah, she'd really like that. Probably get it for, like, 50 bucks, tops. All right, I'll drop you off at school and then I'll go to the dive bar. That's crazy. School is way out of the way. They're doing construction on that one street, it's raining-- what a clusterjam. We should go with you, Dad. All right, you can come, but then right back to... Uh-uh-uh, not another word about school. To the dive bar! Next dating game... speed hand holding. (watch beeps) And... hold hands. Kank-kank! (grunting) Teddy, Teddy, you're gonna hurt her. You're not trying to crush her. What? I don't mind it rough. Very good, Mort. You are as limp as can be. Limp and clammy, my signature hold. (door opens, bell jingles) Sergeant Bosco! What are you doing here? Someone just robbed a jewelry store on Front Street. He fled on foot in this direction so we're going door-to-door. Oh. All we know is he's five-ten to six-feet tall with an athletic build. Eh, none of you guys fit that description. Wow, that's harsh. Hey. A few years ago. Bosco, I couldn't help notice you don't have a wedding ring. Did the guy steal that, too? No, I chucked it into a ravine after my divorce went through. Oh. Officer (over radio): 500 block is negative. Well, keep looking! Damn, we had him, and then we lost him. Talking to me, Bosco? No! Maybe don't leave your thumb on the button? Eh, what's going on in here? Speed dating. Ladies, I think we've got a new contestant. No, no, if I wanted to feel like a loser, I'd just call my kids. But this is Bob's Burgers' Speed Dating. Ladies and cops eat free. All right, you got five minutes. Okay, couple up, clank-clank! How can I help you? Yeah, I was here about 15 years ago and I-I played this old timey-looking love tester thing. Do you still have it? You mean Dr. Love's Love Testometer? Yeah, that's it. He knows it. Hooray. Eh, the owner sold it a few years ago. Oh, man. Do you know who he sold it to? Nah, no clue, sorry. I know where it is. Hugo! Bob. Bob. Ron. Hugo. Yes, what? Oh. You know where the love testometer that used to be here is? I do. In fact, later today I'm inspecting the establishment where it's currently testometering. That's great. I think you should invest in new soap for your bathroom before you purchase vintage amusements. You think soap's the problem with our bathroom? But it's not for the restaurant. It's my Valentine's Day gift for Linda. Oops, I just forgot where it is. Oh, come on. I'm not helping you buy Linda a romantic Valentine's gift. Maybe you should tell him, Hugo. Maybe I don't want to hear it, Ron. All right. You're such a jerk, Hugo, you know that? There are 97 bars and restaurants in my expansive jurisdiction. Good luck finding it, Bob. (laughs) Bob (sighs): Back to the mall, I guess. Don't take this lying down, Dad. But Hugo won't tell us where the testometer is. He said he's inspecting the place today. So, okay, so what day is it? It's today. Right. So you have to follow him. Yes! It's Valentine's Day, damn it. You're right. He'll lead us right to the love testometer. Let's ride. Hyah! (whoops) But let's get a hot chocolate or something first. It's all rainy out. Great idea, Eugene. Whoo-hoo. Mm-hmm. Tina (groaning): You're too close! He'll see us. I know what I'm doing. I've got a buffer car. You're gonna lead us right to the testometer. And... we lost him. We didn't lose him, we'll catch up. I can still see him. Gene: Look, he's turning. No, no, no, don't turn. All right, uh... Let's see if I can safely go through this red light. We're losing him. Drive! It's safe! It's safe! (horn blaring) Bob: Oh, sorry. Sorr... I'll go. (car horn beeps) I'll go... Stop! (truck horn blares) Okay! (horns honking) I'm... I'm in the FBI. It's, uh, uh... it's official business! S-Sorry. (horns honking) Kank-kank. All right, new game. Everyone say your favorite food. (watch beeps) Go. Soy sauce. Wax lips? Plain white rice. Fried green tomatoes. Favorite love-making position. Go! The Fried Green Tomato. The Pick n' Roll. The Broken Sprinkler. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. The Sticky Wicket. No, no, no. Getting people to say their favorite things isn't gonna work. Sure it is. If you like the same food or s*x angles, you're compatible. I'd do the exact opposite. I'd make everyone say the worst thing about themselves, the most embarrassing, darkest secret. If the other person can stomach you for another second, then maybe you have a chance together, maybe. What? That is the least romantic... I want to do it. Let's do it. I'm game. No. I'll go first. Hi there. I'm part of a secret society. We hunt men for sport. Hello. I've had a yeast infection for ten years. Stop. Oh, Gina, no. (gags) Sometimes I just put the mail down the storm drain. I knew it. I knew it. Yeah, there you go. I called in a b*mb threat once 'cause I heard Mark Harmon was staying at this hotel. I wanted to see him evacuate, and then I stalked him for a year and hit his wife with my car. No, stop it. Saying icky stuff about yourselves isn't what Valentine's Day is about. Now, stop it. Well, it's what love's about. And if you women can handle my baggage, then you can fly with me, but bring a sick bag, 'cause it's gonna be a real bumpy ride. Clean-up, aisle my panties. No. Psst, over here. Huh? Hey, do you have a coin-operated machine in there that predicts love? Can't I just take out the trash one time without getting hit on by some perv? He may be a perv, but that's my dad. Hugo's gonna take forever. We wouldn't have to wait for Hugo to lead us to the next place if we found out where he's going. It's locked. But the window's open a crack. Maybe we can find a hanger or... Hangers are for Sunday school clothes. Bring me a rock. We're not smashing the window. It'll look like the rain did it. Do it. Get that clipboard. Gene, stop. Ron: Uh, thanks. Hugo would have blamed me for that. Oh, hey. Hi, Ron. This is... Ron, what are you doing here? Hey! This not my van. We were just gonna get some ice cream from this truck here. We're just getting the clipboard. Listen, Hugo's wrong not to help you out. I don't know which place has the testometer, but, uh, this is where we're going today. Hey, thanks, Ron. You know, we'll check those places out. You're a good guy to help us. You're a great guy. I look up to you, man. Oh. I wouldn't mind having a friend like you. Okay, let's go, kids. Thanks again, Ron. See you. ♪ Falafel ♪

  Kids, uh, stay outside. Excuse me, sir, do you have something called the love testometer? I got your love testometer right here, pal. That goes in the buttbank. Gene: Yah! Yah! Hyah! Well, this is the last place on the list. It better be here. I'll have a seven and seven. No! Make it an eight and eight. Make mine a double, would you? A 16 and 16, thank you. I'm good with water. No, wait. Um, yeah, just water. Kids, please. Look, I-I've been driving all over, trying to find my wife this Valentine's gift, and you're my last hope. Everybody loves these tiny umbrellas. How many does she want? No, no, no. I'm actually looking for Dr. Love's Love Testometer. Please say you have it; I want to buy it from you. You want to buy my love testometer? You-you actually have it? Yeah, it's right over there. It's exactly as I remembered. It's beautiful. I'd love to sell it to you. Great! But I can't, I already sold it. Hello, Bob. Lookie what I just boughtie. Odd bumping into you here, Bob. Oh, wait. No, it's not. I knew you were coming, thanks to Mr. Opens-the-van-for-anyone over here. Hugo noticed the missing carbon copy from the clipboard. Nerd. Now Ron's not allowed to ride up front with me in the van. Come on, Dad, you need to get that testometer for Mom. I'm starting to disappear. How much did he pay for that? A hundred bucks for that junk. (sighs) All right. Hugo, please sell me the love testometer. Uh, no. Hugo, this isn't about me and you. This is about giving a woman a gift to make up for years of-of... Crap? Well, not quite crap, Tina. Last-minute nothings? Crap. Listen, Hugo, please sell it to me. Linda deserves it. Okay, Bob, I will sell it to you. For $500. But you only paid $100. $500? Is that thing magic? You want it or not, Bob? Of course he wants it. It's just his money's all tied up in real estate right now so... Do you take fake credit cards? All right, fine. Another thing about me, I'm hooked on pills. The bad kind that make you feel good. I like to play with a yo-yo, so something comes back to me. People, enough with the confessions. You should know that there's hardwood under this carpet. Yeah, there you go. Stop, Mort, keep that carpet on. Damn it, Sergeant Bosco. You're infecting everyone with your poison. Don't you have a jewelry store thief to catch or something? That's why I have one of these; it's called a radio. And one of these; it's called a g*n. Yeah, well, what you don't have is one of these. (imitates heartbeat) A heart. Mmm. Ugh. Pleasure doing business with you, Bob. Wow. Now you won't have to get Mom another gift for 30 years. Yup. This is the best present ever, a living memory. Your Mom and I even carved our initials on the side. See? Who's "BB"? Bob Belcher. No, who's the other "BB"? Uh, what other... Oh, God. (rock music playing) This is fun. What? Barbara Bunkley! Oh, how could I have forgotten that Valentine's Day was with Barbara Bunkley? Who is Barbara Bunkley? What was I thinking? Barbara Bunkley! Will someone please tell me who Barbara Bunkley is?! I'm guessing it's our real mom. And she's beautiful and sporty. She was my girlfriend the year before I met your mother. I can't believe that. The date I'm remembering wasn't with your mom. (laughing) What a moron! So this love mission was a sham? Hugo, I don't want it anymore. Take this stupid thing back. Oh, no, Bob, no refunds. Okay, okay, there we go. I guess we're a little short on women, huh? Yeah, yeah, work those nubs. Ooh, that's it, right there. Another hard truth about me... Oh, you stupid... I pepper-sprayed my barber, but I mean, look at this. (angry muttering) Here it goes. I dress up as Santa every night. It's the only way I can go to sleep. Uh... What, Miss ten-year yeast infection. See a doctor, why don't you? (angry muttering) I have a prison pen pal. He thinks my name is Michelle. Technically he's my fiancé. I also ran over Vinny Testaverde's wife. Oh, that's it! Everyone needs to stop listening to this cruddy duddy right now! Kank-kank-kank. Too bad, Linda, you just don't know anything about dating. Yes, I do. Then why is everyone listening to me? They're not. They are. Oh, yeah, well, without this... (gasping) Whoa! ...no one's gonna listen to you anymore, tough guy. Yeppity-do, da-da-da. Sha-ba-da-ba-bum. Uh, Lin, I don't think you can take a police officer's g*n. Sure I can. I just did. Look. No, I mean, by law. Do you have any idea what you've just done? No. Kind of. Is it bad? You're under arrest. (groans) Oof, oof, tight. Too tight. Shush. One size fits all. Shut up. What's going on? Mommy's getting arrested. What? Whoa-ho-ho, I thought Dad blew it. Yeah, well, Mommy blew it real bad here today. She blew it. Oh. What's going on is taking an officer's sidearm is a felony. Whoa, Mom, you took his g*n? She sure did, Louise. I just wanted to get control of speed dating. That does not seem like a thing you would need a g*n for. Where have you been, Bobby? We spent all day helping Dad get you the perfect Valentine's gift. All day? You kids weren't at school? Dad sprung us. I wanted to do something special for you today. We... we went all over town trying to find this thing from our first Valentine's Day together. Dad ran a red light. We went to Chinatown. And Pickles. Pickles? And I spent $500 on it, but it wasn't from our first Valentine's Day together. It was from a Valentine's Day I spent with Barbara Bunkley. I remembered it wrong. I'm so sorry, I'm... I'm an idiot. So you're telling me you let the kids play hooky to run all over town to hunt down some expensive thing you remembered from a date we didn't even go on? Yes. That... is... so romantic! Aw. Aw. What? Oh, Bobby! You went through all that trouble for me. This is the best Valentine's Day ever. Ever! (radio beeps) Give me that. So you came here for speed dating? No. A jewelry store got robbed. The suspect was spotted in the area. But you stayed for speed dating? Yeah. You must be hard up for chicks. Yup. I'm sorry I'm getting arrested on Valentine's Day. Come here. (kissing sounds) Ow. Ow. So, uh... what, I'll-I'll follow you two down to the station? Yep. This little lady is going right to... (static crackles) Shh! Shh! Wait! Shut up! Shut up! Officer (over radio): Be advised. Jewelry store suspect spotted at 15th and Grand. All right, I'm on my way. You, follow me. Well, I guess it's your lucky day. You talking to me? No, for God's sake. I'll show you how to use the radio when you get back to the station. Oh! It's so easy to call in a false tip. Those streets don't even intersect. Hi, Tina. Hi, Jimmy, Jr. You weren't at school today, so I brought you your homework. Thanks. And a Valentine's card. (groaning) Aren't you gonna open it? "Heart" not "from." Yes. So, see you at school tomorrow. I'd really "heart" that. Uh, what? I'd really "hea..." I got to get going. Yeah, me, too. So, that, uh, stuff you said earlier, that's the worst about you? Yup. That's it. Oh, except for one time... Oh, oh, oh! Don't say it. Here's my number. (shuttering moan) Hey, I made a match! I bet I screw this up. Linda: Kank-kank-kank. ♪ ♪ Linda: ♪ Two people ♪

Tina, quick, Rorschach test, go. Um, Greg Kinnear from As Good as it Gets? Yes, wow. Shh, shh, I'm on the phone with the bank. Okay, so bounce the check to the power company, bounce the check to the relish guy, but make sure the beef supplier goes through. Without beef, the whole system falls apart. (laughing): Yeah, at least my bedroom beef supply is free. Yeah. Sheesh. Thanks, Marci. You're a lifesaver. I'll talk to you later, honey. God, I can't believe we're doing controlled bounces, and I can't believe you talk that way to the bank. Oh, what, with Marci? It's okay. We don't have any secrets. You know, her husband had to get recircumcised last year. The first one grew back. They don't grow back. Somehow it did. They had to have an adult "brisk"; it was freaky. It's not a brisk; it's a bris. All this brisket talk is making me hungry. And why do you do the books this way? Your system is crazy. It's the only way to keep our heads above water, my love. Well, then, we've got to find a way to cut down on expenses. What can we live without? Uh, probably Gene and Tina. That's a good start. Huh, well, it makes the things I was gonna cut irrelevant. Good. You know what? I could get a part-time job. Huh, what? No, Lin, it hasn't come to that yet. Yeah, you're right. Hey, maybe I'll start shopping at that Fresh Feed place up the street. I hear it's really cheap. Oh, yeah, that's good. They have those peanut butter mini donuts. I prefer the yogurt-covered peanut butter mini donuts, but, hey, I have a refined palette. Refined? You lick your own armpits. They're naturally spicy. "People go nuts for our nuts." (laughs) What a hoot. I love it. "In a hurry for some curry?" Hmm, kind of. Mmm... mmm... mmm. Hey, buddy, one sample per customer. A serving size is four mini egg rolls. Therefore, four pieces equals one sample. Good day, sir. (growls) I think there's someone behind the milk.

Yeah, can you tell me where the wine is? Ah, the grown-up grape juice. Come with me to our vineyard. Ooh, wine in a squeeze bottle. Fun. (disco music playing) Oh. Huh? It's time for a disco minute. How long's it last? A minute. It must be great working here. Yup, we have fun. It's kind of our thing. I love it when a place has a thing. And the hours are flexible, which is fantastic for someone like me. You never know when the perfect breeze is going to blow. Huh? I'm a semipro kite pilot. A what? I don't understand. What part do you not understand? The words-- I don't understand them. I'm a kite pilot. Kite pilot. Mm-hmm, my babies. Okay. Wow, that's great. So there's flexible hours here, huh? Hey, did this just become a job interview? You interested? Me? What? No. No, I don't know, I couldn't-- no... Guess who got a job at Fresh Feed. Check it out. That's what Mom will be doing at the checkout. Yeah, paper or plastic, Mom? Am I right? All right. What, you got a job? But it hasn't come to that yet, remember? I think what Mom's trying to say is: "Take this job and shove it, Bob!" Yeah, I'm bringing home the bacon now. (laughs) Oh, I forgot to get bacon. We have to go back! (panting) You really got out of bed this morning. I couldn't wait! Oh, I'm so freaking excited about my first day on the job! Yeah, I heard you the first time, when you were singing in the shower. ♪ I'm so freaking excited ♪
♪ About my first day on the job. ♪ Yeah! Ow, ow! Soap in my eye! You finally got out, Mom. Don't look back. It's only part-time. Don't be so dramatic. It's just something I'm doing to save the family. No big deal. Hey, Greg! Hey, Linda. Show me around. Give me the tour. Okay. A little pushy there. Ooh, is that a water cooler? Oh, God, I'm gonna be gossiping around a real water cooler like on TV! I love it. Aw... This is the bread aisle. There's Mitch. He's in a Steve Miller Band cover band. Hey, does anyone call you the Space Cowboy? Yeah, but right now I'm the Gangster of Loaves. Ooh... Good one, Mitch! They get funnier every time. It's a little buggy in produce. Yeah, turns out flies like fruit. Thanks for pointing that out, though. Mort: How you gonna get by without Linda, Bob? She's only working part-time. I'll be fine. Did Linda show you how to work the thermostat? It's the same as it always is. No. Linda accounts for outside temperature, grill temperature, the number of customers in here. Linda can play that thermostat like a violin. Now that you mention it, I do feel a little shvitzy. Oh, me, too. Shirt's coming off. Fine, I'll turn it down. That's not how Linda does it, Bobby. You overshot it. Now we're all gonna freeze. What are you talking about? I moved it, like, two degrees, Teddy. Two degrees is everything. Two degrees k*lled the dinosaurs! Fine! I'll move it back! Too far again. (groans) That's got to come off! Aah! We're gonna start you off nice and easy today. On the ten-items- or-less register. If they have 11, ban 'em or scan 'em. Your call. Oh, my call! Okay. I'm in charge. To a point. Excuse me, did someone lose a monkey? (both chuckle) You're gonna do just fine here. Hey, with Linda gone, we can get into some raunchy locker room talk. Hey, let's describe our testicles with a movie title. (laughs) BOB: What? The Wild Bunch! Wait a minute. What are we doing? One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. (laughs) You have one testicle? You knew that. (door opens) Hey, Bob. Whoa. It's warm in here. Yes, I know, Mike. Thanks. Linda got a part-time job. Teddy, you're looking good. Uh... I don't know. You got a lot of bills here. It's all bills. You guys should pay your bills. Mike's smart. Yup. Hey, we're doing locker room talk. Tell us about your testicles. Good-bye. ♪ Linda stocked corn and she don't care ♪

That's right, I'm part of the Fresh Feed family now, so don't bother with the toothpicks. They just slow me down. (gobbling loudly) Who wants a balloon? Actually, I would like many balloons. I'm gonna do something I should've done years ago. I was hoping you could take me on a tour of the dairy fridge. Oh, yeah. Sure, honey. Yeah. Come on. (humming) Ooh! Go! Be free! You'll float for a few days! Maybe a week. Who knows? But you'll live. You'll live! Wow. It's like I'm backstage at a Broadway show... about people who buy milk. Ooh, I'd see that show-- sort of.

No. I'm lactose intolerant. (sighs) Labels. (phone buzzes) Ah. Mom's texting me. I got to go. Wait! What's your name? Or number? Or measurements? He's gone... (sniffs) but not forgotten.

No, she seems happy at Fresh Feed. But maybe I just think that because she kept saying how happy she is. Let her live a little, Dad. She's only been off leash one day.

  Kids, listen. Your mom... she wants to be here, right? Oh, yeah. Of course. Yeah, sure. It's so great here. Uh, yeah, I think so. Hello, my family. Oh, God, it's hot. Guess who aced her first performance review! Listen, Lin, uh, I want to say something. Are you gonna say that I got all A's on my report card? In all Fresh Feed areas? Report cards at work? Really? Yeah, I aced my first week. They want me to go full-time. Shift manager. You're not gonna take it, right? No, it's just nice that they appreciate me there. That's all. Oh, come on, Lin. You're feeling underappreciated here? A little bit. What, do you want me to give you a performance review? That would be a nice start, Bob. (laughing): Hold on, hold on, let me get comfy. And... evaluate your wife. Okay. Uh, Linda, you clean the bathroom well. Okay. And you know how to restock a napkin dispenser. All right. But you're on the phone sometimes when you shouldn't be. Ooh. And you don't wear a hairnet and you hair falls out a lot. What?! And you're always sneaking pickles! But you are, um... Come on, Dad. You've got this, Dad. You're sometimes friendly to people. Oh! Mom, huh?! Yeah. That's nice. Not enjoying this. Uh, but you're... Anything else? ...your hands are often dirty. So, you get an eight out of ten. Well, maybe a 7.5. What?! No, eight. Definitely an eight out of ten. Eight out of ten?! Well, Fresh Feed loves me! They gave me a locker. A locker, Bob! Maybe I should go full-time! Great. Have fun with your locker and your report cards and your Steve Miller Band cover bands. They have a name! The Abracadabblers. I will have fun! Because it's fun there! Then go ahead, Lin. If you don't want to be here, then don't be here! We'll be fine without you! Okay, I will! I'm a full-time Fresh Feeder! And here's a review for you! (blowing raspberries) Uh, Dad's gonna need your g*n and your badge, too, Mom. I get her apron because it still smells like her and I like it because I'm 11 and I still like Mom. (blowing raspberries) Okay, kids, I'll see you tonight. I'm working a full day today. Bye, Mom. I'll probably see you later when I swing by to hang out in the milk fridge. Sorry, kids. You can't go to Fresh Feed. I need you here. No! Your father's right, my babies. You better stay here. 'Cause he's a disaster without me. No, I'm not. I'm kidding. You're not. No... Yes, you are! Bob: I didn't... I... (grunts) All right, Linda, here are the keys to the kingdom. Oof. Ten pounds of keys. Ten pounds of fun! You all set for your first day as shift manager? You bet! I've got my shift together. Great! If you need me, I'll be in Bog Harbor with my fellow kiters. And I just mighters see you tonighters. Hey, Greg, go fly a kite. (laughs) I'm kidding. That's what he does. That's his hobby. Uh, I need quarters. I'll just use my manager key. 'Cause I'm the manager. (disco music starts playing over the PA) Oh, disco minute! (g nting) Hey, Linda, I'm supposed to be writing funny signs, but I'm just not feeling it. You think I could switch to the frozen aisle? Uh, okay. What do you say we take a look at the shift board, huh? Shift board, shift board... where are you? There you go. Okay, I'll, uh... you know what, I'll just take care of it. Mitch: Ah, thanks, Linda. You rock. Oh, hey, nobody ever said I rock at my old job, and I was sleeping with the boss. (laughs) Oh, no, you must be bad at s*x. Same boat. Keep trying. Hey, Linda, I need to pick up my kids at school or something. Can I cut out for the day? Of course! Family first, right? Also, I think I'm gonna be sick tomorrow. Huh? What? Nothing. I'll call you tomorrow. (sighs) How can I find my dream boy if I can't find him? Hey, buck up, little fella. This guy is findable. Let's post this "missed connections" flyer around town.

I just ate a meat loaf and drank a beer, and I am wiped out. Grab a nap? No! Mitch: Manager Linda? We got a shipment in the delivery bay. You need to sign. Whoo, whoo! Okay, I'm coming, coming. No nap! Just a little one. No nap! Just a little rest for the eyes. See you in 20. No nap! Tina: I'll find you. Until then, avoid infection. ♪ Hey, Linda, cover for me?

Can I go in the milk fridge? Yeah. Yeah, sure. Yeah, the milk fridge. You can restock and... You're all out of shopping carts. Well, then just buy what you can hold, honey! Oh, and, uh... bring your brother and sister. I love them. ♪ This is working, this is working... ♪ Gene: Hey, Mom. Where's this new batch of samples? Are they savory or are they crave-ory? Oh, forget about the samples. You get to help Mommy bag, okay? Ah, man. You tricked us. If we wanted to work, we would have just stayed home. Yeah, if we lived here, we'd be at work by now. I'll help in the dairy fridge. Louise, uh... grab that pricing g*n and-and price those tuna cans. $1.29. Okay, come on, here we go. All I heard was "grab that pricing g*n." Hey, Dmitri. My check bounced? Uh, you know, we're a little strapped this week. Is it okay if we get it to you next week? Little strapped? Bob, you said you were, like, double overdrawn. Little strapped! Teddy, shush! Shh, yeah, right. (dial tone) Oh, he hung up. Guess that means no meat, huh? Big day for fries. Right? (sighs) Linda has this crazy system for our finances. I forgot to make the deposit, and we got checks out all over the place. Including the power company. Doesn't matter. You don't have any food. You know, this kind of makes me want to loot you. What? Never mind. This isn't working. I'm gonna go get Linda. I'm closing. You got to go, Teddy. What? Why? It's dark. There's no food. There's nothing here for you. That's okay. Go on! Scat!

Next in line! Next! Hey, careful with the eggs, huh? This is careful. Want to see loosey-goosey? Um, a pyramid of grapefruits fell on a lady. I think she's trapped. What? Uh, Gene, you've just been promoted to register! Uh... My first promotion! Watch out, glass ceiling! What are we looking at here? Mmm... bananas. What is that, chicken? Let's just say 30 bucks. 30 bucks? Okay, five bucks. Sorry. Guh. Next! Ooh, someone likes pasta. (humming) Dollar whiskey, dollar scotch, dollar bourbon, dollar crotch. Hey! Great prices! Wish I still drank! (loud chatter) What the hell is going on here? Gene, where's your mother? She's... around here somewhere. Might want to check poultry. (people shouting, grunting) Does this thing work? I don't know. It's my first day here. Linda? It's Bob. Wh-What? Listen, Lin, I'm sorry I acted like I didn't need you. Of course I need you. I can't run the restaurant by myself. Hey, can you ring me up? No, I don't work here. So, Linda, listen... Come on. I have one item. Just take it. Hey, this guy's letting us take stuff! Free aisle! All right, I'm going on break. So, what I really want to tell you is... you make it fun to work at the restaurant. I'd rather be scraping by together than have extra money and be apart. But I understand if you want to try this new life out. I mean... I don't really see the appeal-- it's a pretty nasty market-- but if it makes you happy, then it makes me happy. Hey, come on. That's too much. Oh, Bob, it's awful here. This is just a job. Everyone who works here just wants to leave. I hate it, and I hate the customers. I'm sorry. I know you people can hear me. I just hate it. Yeah, it's called a microphone. She told me she hates you the most. What? Bobby, I want to come back to the restaurant. Oh, Lin... Meet me at register five. I'm on my way! Oh, Linda. Oh, Bob. Oh! Oof, shrimp. (gags, coughs) It's happening! What? Louise, what did you do? I made it rain shrimp. What'd you ever do? Get underneath them! They're self-dipping! Tina: Give up, Tina.a. You're cold and lonely. And you shouldn't have drank that gallon of milk. (gasps) Hi. I'm Tina from the fridge. Can I see your index finger? Nothing weird. It fits. Is it you? Did you come back? I did. Every day this week. For me or the milk? For both. I can't stop thinking about you. I want to meet face-to-face. I-I don't know. What if we ruin what we have? Shh, shh. Don't say that. I can't reach. Here. Shh. Thank you. Take a chance for once in your life. If it doesn't work out, we'll always have the milk. I'm coming out. (grunts) (grunts) I'm stuck. I know you can't see the other half of me, but trust me, it's there. (chanting): Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! (sighs) Wow. I'm Josh. Joshua... Bob: What's Tina doing? Tina, stop kissing strange boys in the dairy fridge. We're going home! I have to go. Here's a bunch of numbers. They may look random, but they're my phone number. Cool. They look like they're in a good order. Oh, hey, Linda. (chuckles) The strings were tight today, boy. Everything good here? Hi, Greg. Thanks for taking a chance on me. I quit, but don't let that influence hiring other pre-middle-age mothers. Okay, thanks, bye. What? I... (gasps) Greg: Hey! Well, I guess, now that I don't work at Fresh Feed anymore, we're back to scrimping and saving. Maybe we can find other ways to make some extra money. Louise: If there's one thing I know, it's that s*x sells. So all we have to do is find some s*x and sell it.
Gene: Anyone notice anything different about me? New boobs? New 'tude? Wrong and wronger. I'm pregnant! Wha...? We're getting flour sack babies in health class. You do have that glow. Aw, my little baby's having babies. I'm a sexy grandma. I can't believe they're going to let you be in charge of a child. What are you talking about? I was born to be a mother. I'm gonna pull a flour sack out of my bottom. Bob: Morning, everyone. Wow, Don Draper's kind of fat this season. Ooh, you look sharp, mister. The jury is gonna find you guilty of handsome in the first degree. Oof, um, ah. I'm contesting a parking ticket, Lin. There isn't a jury. You've got a suit that won't a-quit. Wait a second, there's no stains on that. That's not your suit. My suit didn't fit anymore, so I borrowed this from Mort. Some poor guy's wife brought two for the burial and left this one behind. Why don't I ever get to wear dead people's clothes? When I'm gone, I'll leave you all my socks. Aw, I wanted those. Okay, class, now that you've been assigned life partners, kiss your childhood good-bye and your babies hello. Let's have all the fathers come up and assume responsibility for their reckless behavior. Travis Albright. He has your eyes. But hopefully not your A.D.D. Huh? Gene Belcher. He's beautiful. Now, remember, even the smallest mistake will affect your child's life forever. (gasps) Oh, my God! I'm sorry. Can I have another one? I don't know, Gene. Can people just have another baby? Well, yes, they can. So here you go. But if you drop this one, I'll have to fail you. Ah! Gene, you're getting an F. Ah! For "failing father." I can fix this! (grunting) See, he's fine. He's good; He's happy. Ah! I need a baby! (gasping) Go back to your seat, Gene. And wipe that baby off your face. I couldn't see the meter because there was a kid standing in front of it, and, um, he was exactly meter-sized. Really? Yeah. Meter-sized? Well, and-and I think he was loitering, sir. Well, Mr. Belcher... we're gonna let this one go. Really? Yes. I'm dismissing the ticket. Okay, wow. Maybe next time use the valet, huh? (chuckles) (chuckles): I will. I definitely will... Next case! You look important. Will you marry my mom? What? Uh, oh, um... Sweetie, sweetie, don't bother that nice gentleman. I'm so sorry. He's an idiot. Ah, I'm sure. "Gentleman." Wow. I would've been a great dad. Louise: Gene, cheer up. Why not focus your energy on losing that baby weight? No! I'm moping. I'm gonna take the long way home. Tell Mom not to make anything for dinner with flour. And a flour-less chocolate cake for dessert! (tone chimes) What was that? Robotic Voice: Hello. Who said that? Hello. Are you a ghost? 'Cause I'm a Ghostbuster! And I'm a police officer. And a Sagittarius. I do not understand your command. Please sit to create profile. (screams) Please log in with name now.

Warming seat now. (sighs): Mmm. Gene: Who's the Queen of England? Toilet: Elizabeth the second. Who's the Queen of the Night? Whitney Houston. Who's the Queen of the... wait a second! Bidet? Don't mind if I bid-do. (gasps) I knew that would happen, but I did it anyway. (classical music playing) I'm not just saying this because I'm your friend, but that is amazing. (beep) Alert.

Well, a little bird told me you might have seen something I'm looking for: A toilet. I haven't seen one. I-I've never even used one! Come here, just for a sec. Uh, no. I want to tell you something. Ma... okay. Yell it. I mean, I mean, I want to give you something. I already have enough. You don't know what it is. I know. I just feel like I know what I can carry and I have my... night planned. You won the lottery. Oh. Then I better go quit my job! Where is it?! (panting) Where's my toilet?! (grunting) (groans) You're my baby boy now, Belcher. I'm not sure, but I think people are treating me different because of this suit. Last night on the street, this homeless guy saluted me. Can't believe I almost buried that suit. If you buried it now, it'd probably claw itself out of the grave to get back on Bobby. That would make a great movie. Suit Cemetery. I'd see that, but only the matinee. I wouldn't want to come home to a dark closet. Ooh, here comes the three-piece! Ah, I... Bow tie, oh, look out! Oh, it got me! Linda, please. I don't want to find another place to eat. I'm dead. Excuse me, do you know where Maestro's Bistro is? Sorry, no, I... What about this place? Hmm, I don't know. How's the food here? Uh, it's really good. I eat here every day. Mmm. Oh. If it's good enough for him. Well, uh, since I'm dining alone, maybe I'll join you. You dining alone? How does that happen? Whoa, whoa, ladies! Bring it down a notch, huh? Why don't I get you a nice booth in the back, right? We were all single once, but you don't got to be a slut about it, you know? It's just a little bit further, and it's amazing!

You're not the first person who's had to find a power source for his talking toilet. Right, right. We'll have to go home and get some batteries, extension cords. We'll steal a car, we'll siphon the gasoline into a generator. We'll help you, Gene. Thanks, T. It takes a village to charge a toilet. Where have you kids been? It's late. Glee club. Key club. Ski club? Oh, extracurriculars. I love it. Yeah, we have a triple-club emergency. We need extension cords and lots of them. Well, well, well, if it isn't Baby Boy Belcher. (screams) Did you lose this somewhere? (screams) Uh, kids, this guy's looking for a lost toilet. And he's not crazy. He's Max, uh... sorry, I didn't, uh, catch your last name. Eh, Flush. Your name's Max Flush and you're looking for a toilet? (laughs): That's funny. (laughs): And his name is Bob Burger. What? His name is Bob Burger. Um, it's not. It is. It isn't, no. It's not? No. Are you serious? Bob Burgers. How... Bob Burgers. Then who am I thinking of? I don't know. But-but the sign. Okay, well, I'm still missing a toilet. I was delivering it, but it fell off my truck. My toilet's worth $14,000. So I'm gonna find it. $14,000? For 14 grand, I'd let that toilet poop on me. (laughs) Lin. My toilet's special. State of the art. I'm very motivated to find it. Have you told the toilet how you feel? The toilet knows how I feel! Okay, Mr. Flush, we'll-we'll let you know if we see it, and, uh, we're closing early, so... Closing early? Yeah, I'm gonna use the money I saved on that ticket and take Linda and my suit out to a nice dinner. We're going to Beville's! It's fancy. They give you bread in a basket with a napkin inside of it. Can I come? No. Oh. Okey dokey. I guess I'll just be on my way then. (whistling classical music) Before we go, we should take out the trash. Lin, do you mind? I'm kind of in a suit. Okay, but I'm not gonna lie down in any puddles for you to cross, mister. Just kidding, I will. (kisses) Oh, no, he's not leaving! He's staking us out. We'll have to lay low for a while. We can't lay low. We have to get back to the toilet! We'll need a plan. Tina, cancel all of my appointments. That's gonna take a while. Gene, hold my calls. (screams) Now he wants to switch eyes! Okay, operation Capture the Throne is go. Andy and Ollie are on their way here. Everybody know what they're doing? In general or in the plan? The plan, Tina. Oh, whew. We just have to wait for Mom and Dad to get out of here, already. The toilet's only got two hours left. Linda: How do I look? Well, no one's gonna be looking at you, Lin. Oh. Bye! Bye. Bye. Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye. Bye. Bye, bye. Bye. Stay out of my room. (door closes) 

  Here come Andy and Ollie. What's taking them so long? They're both trying to carry each other at the same time. (both grunting) Sorry, Samantha. (grunts) I'm Tina! No, you're me. Oh. I'm selling pens to benefit my Beaver Scout troo. How many can I put you down for? (scoffs) None. Seven? Zero. Zero hundred and seven? Oh, fine, I'll take two. (engine starts) Hey! (tires screeching) Linda: Party of two-ty-toot-toot. (laughs) I'm a fun customer; You're gonna love me. I'm sorry, unless you have a reservation, it's an hour wait. An hour, really, hmm? Oh, are you together? Maybe we have something. Let me check. May I bring you a cocktail? Ooh, appletinis. Uh, yeah, we'll have two. Two each. (chuckles) I'm serious. I'm coming, toilet! Don't you quit on me! (kids panting) (tires screech) Guess we're in the same boat now, Baby Boy Belcher. (chuckles) Oh, my. (ball bounces) What the...? (groans) Have a great time on King's Head lsland, sucker! Rent a golf cart; They're super fun. This isn't over! I can make my knees smile. (panting) Toilet? Hello, Gene. Maintenance required. Don't worry, help is on the way. 33 minutes of battery life remaining. Everything's going to be okay. We'll be telling jokes again in no time. Loading joke. Knock-knock. Who's there? Interrupting toilet. Interrupting toilet...? (makes flushing sound) (laughs, cries) Hang in there, buddy. We're going to get you fixed up. These are from the couple over there. Thank you. Ah... not for you, for him. Oh. Oh, I still haven't finished my s*x on the Beach from that foot clinic doctor. Yeah, we got to pick up the pace. Double fist 'em... go. I don't know, Lin, I mean, I drove, or maybe you drove. One of us drove, right? It's all right, we-we'll take a snatchy. What? We'll take a snatchy. (laughs): What-What's a snatchy? The yellow thing. Well, I need a better hint than that. It's got wheels. A taxi? (laughs): Yeah, a snacky. You said... Snacky! Wait, you keep changing it. You got it, stop teasing me. Well, you said "snatchy." Shut up, drink. Okay. 11 minutes of battery life remaining. Where are they? (shudders) It's getting cold out here. Warming seat. No, save your energy! I'll warm my butt the old-fashioned way. (grunting) Finally. Hello, what a beauty. She's a hottie potty, baby, haw! Wow, does it wipe for you, too? What's wipe? Now, I got to pee in this baby. No, get away from him, you monster! He's dying! We don't have much time! Flush some chicken soup into him! Or put on a movie he likes! Yeah. Everybody, close your eyes and believe. No, we have to move him. Lift with your butts. (all grunting) Oh, man. This is heavier than my mom at the prom. 'Cause she was pregnant with me. Nine minutes of battery life remaining. Oh, no, no, no, no. Hurry, hurry... go! Mush, mush! You can't flush me. (giggles) Wow, Beville's was great, but I'm still kind of hungry. Me, too. Did we forget to eat? Oh, my God, we did. (both laugh) Who cares? Let's just make out. Uh, scenic route, sir? You betcha. (Linda and Bob laughing) Hang in there, buddy, we're almost there. Pedal with your heart! (tires screeching) Ah, it's Max Flush! Pedal faster! That way! (kids screaming) I don't see him. Yeah! We're doing it, we're doing it! Whoo-hoo, we're home free! Wait, there's no bridge. Stop! (tires screeching) Fly, toilet, fly! Toilets can't fly, Gene. This one can! Activate wings! Playing artist Wings. N-N-N-N-No. (screams) (screams) (grunting) (tires screech) No...! If you want this toilet, you'll have to go through me, Max Flush! Gene? Dad? Mom? What you doing in the middle of the road with a toilet? He's more than a toilet! He's my best friend and he's dying! Okay. Ah, now he's losing fluids! W-Wait, is this that guy's missing $14,000 toilet? We need to get him to a power source immediately. Well, I-I don't think we can ask the cab driver to... Toilet in the taxi, sir? Really? (all cheering) I still don't really understand what's happening. I don't either, but I'm having fun. (laughs) There's a coffee shop... they'll have outlets. For people writing screenplays. Pull over! (all grunting) Bob: I'm drunk. Toilet: Two minutes of battery life remaining. Hey, you can't bring that in here. Your sign says restrooms are for customers only, not that customers can't bring in their own restrooms. That restroom is mine. Hey, toilet guy. Look, my son found your toilet. And I'll never give him back! You just want to take him somewhere where he'll get pooped on! I'll never let that happen! I'll never let anything bad happen to him ever! Battery dead. Good-bye. No...! Kid, he's a toilet. He'll be fine once he's recharged. There's a family waiting for him... a very nice family... so let me take him. He belongs with me, and you'll never be able to move both of us! Yeah, if you think you're gonna get Gene off the toilet before he's ready, I've got some bad news for you. He missed his birthday party once. We had a clown. We had to send him in there. You give me that toilet! What's the problem here? (chuckles): No problem, no problem. These people brought in an outside toilet and they refuse to leave. Yeah, you should probably deal with that. Hey, that looks like that toilet that was reported stolen. Welp, sure hope you figure that out. Freeze! Stop right there. Get him! (grunts) Yeah! Oh! Where you're going, they don't have any toilets. Well, they do, but it's out in the open and it's embarrassing. Warm my butt. You're useless, useless! Gene, stop yelling at the toilet. It just sits there and takes it. I know that fancy toilet was your friend and you liked him, but he wasn't yours and he's probably evidence now. He needed me to take care of him, Dad, and I let him down. I'll never get to have anything nice, like a bag of flour or a toilet. Look, Gene, it's not easy to take care of things. I mean, one time when you were a baby and I was watching you, you ate a fern, and you could have died, but you didn't. Huh. My point is, you tried to take care of the toilet and you did the best you could. That's all anyone can do. I guess. Sorry I yelled at you. It's not your fault you're stupid. Linda: Gene, get in here! Your friend's on TV! Olsen Benner (over TV): This morning, the ferry's most important passenger isn't a person, it's a toilet. (gasps) It's him! This $14,000 toilet was allegedly stolen by a Timones J aka the Bathroom Burglar. He said his name was Max Flush. And you believed that? Um... Eh... Ah... um, no, I'm... Yeah... no, wha... why... Fittingly, this royal flusher is headed back to its rightful owner on King's Head lsland. Live from the ferry landing, I'm Olsen Benner. Mom, get the car. I have to go to the toilet. Ooh, I got chills when you said that. There he is. Gene, go! Whoa, whoa, whoa, sorry, kid, can't go near that toilet. Uh, Officer, can you cut him a break? It's a long story, but he-he just wants to say good-bye. Kind of weird, but, all right, sir, your kid's got one minute. Hello, toilet. I know you can't hear me, but I just... Hello, Gene. Toilet, they charged you. Activate bidet? Yes! I-I mean, no. I think I just have time to say good-bye. Good-bye, Gene. I... I love you. Please repeat command. I love you. You would like to vomit? No, I love you. Seat up for vomit. No, I love you. Vomit now. I love you. Vomit. I love you! Vomit now. Vomit now. (groans) Stop saying that! Vomit now. Damn fool! Okay, this is just sad. I know. Huh, that suit looks just like one my dad had. Yeah, it's a nice one, huh? I love it. Yeah, let me see the label. Um, I... There's my dad's name. "Tailored for Paul McGill." That's weird... his name is Bob Burgers. That's my dad's suit! Where'd you get it? A funeral home? What?! A funeral home. It's a home for funerals. (boat horn blowing) I'll never forget that toilet. I'll never forget that suit. At least you still got your birthday suit. Yeah, too bad it's wrinkly. Let's get Dad dry-cleaned. Nah, I'll press him.

(keyboard playing laser blasting, dog barking, farting) Okay, tell me the truth, am I stuck in a laser/dog bark/fart rut? No. Yes. (sighs) Has anyone seen my volcano? Did you check all your pockets? Can you describe what it looks like? Well, it's volcano-shaped, and it's my science fair project from last year. Oh, it's in the liquor cabinet. I've been using it as a wine koozie. It's fun, I love it. Introducing my science fair project for this year. Hold on. Wait, you're turning in the same project again? Will Mr. Blevins let you do that? Yeah, Louise, he's not just a teacher, he's the head of the science fair. He must be swimming in women. Don't worry about Blevins. I can play him like a fiddle. A strange, puffy fiddle with a ponytail and a sad butt. Louise, shouldn't you just do a new project, like you're supposed to? Why? Um, I don't know, to learn something? You learn something. Okay honey, good luck with your volcano. 123, 124... (sighs): What are you two kooks doing? It's for our science fair project: "How Many Hairs Are Up There?" The tough part is keeping them all organized. I ga... Oh! One, two... You guys are working too hard. As per "uuge." Good morning, children. My name is Mr. Dinkler, and I will be taking over this science class. Whoa, whoa whoa, what? What happened to Mr. Blevins? He's dead. To this classroom. He's at home recovering from a severe attack of gout. But I'm sick of talking about him, so let's just move on already. Some of you might recognize me if you've been down to the Science Museum on Tuesday nights. I am a Thomas Edison impersonator and reenactor. Thomas Edison was the greatest genius who ever lived. (sarcastic laugh) Oh, boy. Can anyone name any of his inventions? The lightbulb... The lightbulb. The phonograph. The kinetoscope. It goes on and on and on, basically everything. So, I know the fourth grade science fair is coming up, because I'm in charge of it now. I only have one rule for science fairs: No vol-ca-noes. Huh? Kids have been using these papier-matcher monstrosities to avoid real work for years, and I'll have none of it. (laughing): Okay, Mr. Dinkler, time out. Relax. I already got the go-ahead from Mr. Blevins on my volcano. Dinkler: Huh? So, I'm kind of grandfathered in there. What is your name, young lady? It's Louise, as in "Jeez, Louise, you're the best." Why don't we find you another topic? Oh, no, that's not necessary. I already got it. I'll pick one for you. Don't need to, I got one. Yeah... Thank you so much. Nope, gonna pick one. And it's the best topic in the world: Thomas Edison! Um, but I'm doing Thomas Edison. You can both do Edison, moron. There's enough of him to go around, trust me. (sighs) Mr. Dinkler, you're new here, so please don't be offended if I disregard everything you say and turn in Mt. Louise-ius here. Wow, I bet stuff comes out of the top where this hole is and it's just a real hoot. Yeah. Oh, no. Oops. (screaming) Why did I throw that down? Wha... Oh, wha... I'm stepping on it? No! Why am I stepping on it? (Louise screaming) Over and over and over again. Stop it! (Louise screaming) Uh-huh. You're doing Edison, kid. How about some science, huh? Ugh, I can't believe that guy. Hmph. And now I have to go to the library, which I never wanted to have to do. Ugh! Yeah, ugh! Wait, I like the library. I need information on Thomas Edison. Something no one would recognize if plagiarized. Biographies, under "E." Thanks. That's my job. And I love it. (whispers): Topsy. Hmm? I didn't say anything. (whispers): Tooooopsssyyyyy. Are you saying Top Chef? I think he said Topsy. No, I didn't. (whispers): Yes, I did. What's a Topsy? I don't know, don't ask me. (whispers): Look it up. Like in a book? Yeah, sure, books are great. (whispers): No, use the lnternet. Books are stupid. I thought books were smart. No, they're stupid. But you're a librarian. Yeah, so shh! Louise: Hmm. Topsy. Look, Topsy the circus elephant. Thomas Edison wanted to show the world that AC current was more dangerous than his own patented DC current... Blah, blah, blah. Oh, there's a video. Click that. Ooh, elephant. I bet it sneezes and it's adorable. (elephant trumpets, children scream) What was that? Play it again, Play it again. (elephant trumpets, children scream) It was electrocuted. To d*ath. On purpose. In public. By Thomas Edison. What is he, a supervillain? Well, it says that Topsy trampled three people. Well yeah, she's a big, fat elephant. The point is, I've got my science fair project. I'm gonna tell everyone the truth about Edison the Electro-cutioner. Tell it, sister. So heroic. Let me finish! And make Mr. Dinkler look like an evil-inventor-impersonating ass. There she is. Oh, right. Don't do it, Don't do it. (whispers): Do it, do it. And then I say, "Hey. Lightbulb. "I've got an idea: The lightbulb. I'm Edison, thank you." And everyone claps. Mr. Dinkler, shouldn't Louise and I make sure that we're not both doing the same thing for our Edison project? Well, let's see, Jeremy. Is your project going to blow everyone away? 'Cause if it's not, then don't worry about it. (laughing) What's so funny?! Hey, everybody, volcano-girl here is gonna blow our minds. Did you hear that, Tom? Well, I will! I've got something big, Mr. Dinkler. You ain't got nothing and you know it. You keep believing that, Mr. Dinkler. I will. You keep believing that, (laughing) Mr. Dink-ler. (both laughing) Yes, yes! Ha! Ha! Ha! Very... funny. Ha! Ah! Okay, change of plans. Some little report pasted onto construction paper isn't gonna be enough. Not for that punk. I hate construction paper. Dinkler's a reenactor. I'm going reenactment on his butt. With actors and effects and everything. We're gonna bring this nightmare to life. Oh. Oh. All right, I'm gonna need an Edison and a Topsy. Gene, can you give me a maniacal laugh? Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. Good enough, you're Edison. Tina, act like an elephant. Not bad, you're hired. Oh, you know what else your project needs? Science? Music. By me. Something dramatic, but danceable. Cha, cha, cha, cha. Fine, as long as we electrocute an elephant, it's okay with me. But not really electrocuting, just reenacting. Yes, Tina. Jeesh. Little Miss Don't- Really-Electrocute-Me over here. (chuckling): Diva. Mm-hmm. What else do you want on your rider? Hello, children. Ah, Teddy, come here. I'm doing a project and I need to make huge sparks and lightning bolts. What do you know about that stuff? In high school, my buddies and I built a Van de Graaff generator. You know, to get girls. Ah, nice. Will you do something like that for me? Adults aren't allowed to help, so you'll have to hide. But... eh? Sure. Let's go! Okay, no burger, that's fine. Ahh, I'm not freaking out here! Ahh... I know they're in here somewhere. Bob, come to bed. Here it is. All this science fair stuff reminded me of my old invention. Spiceps. Spice-wah? They're sleeves that you wear on your biceps to hold all your spices while you cook. Wha. Look, (growls). Okay, good night. Hey Lin, what if I was wearing just these. 'Cause, whoop, I am. All right, come here. I'm coming. (Bob growling) Linda: Wait, wait, wait, you're getting spice all over the bed. Topsy... autopsy... Is there something there? I'm not talking; I'm in character. Except, can I trample you? I'm trying to get in that head space. Yeah, sure. (feeble trumpeting) Did, uh, did you guys notice my Spiceps? Dad, not now. (feeble trumpeting) Pffh, Spiceps. You might have something there, if you just changed it completely. They're perfect the way they are. Dad, shush. Okay, Tina, as long as you have perfect pitch, we'll be fine. And a one, and a two. ♪ They'll... ♪ Hello, family. Ugh. Hi, Aunt Gayle. Hey, Gayle, I couldn't understand you on the phone earlier. You sounded like (muffled crying). Is everything all right?

What?! Hmm? The whole point of this is to get back at Mr. Dinkler. Or is it that against all odds, a lonely inventor and a down-on-her-luck elephant find true love? Oh, forget it! Let's just get to the pyro. Tina, stand on Teddy's yoga mat and don't move or it's... (buzzing) Are you sure this is safe? Teddy, tell Tina your yoga mat will keep her safe because it's rubber, over. Teddy: My... wait, who? Tina, she's standing on the yoga mat. So can we do this? (transmission cutting out) Okay, we can't hear you very well. So let's just go on my count. Three, two, one! (buzzing) My trunk! (all exclaiming) (sizzling) Wow. Wait till Mr. Dinkler hears about this. Wait till Mr. Dinkler sees this. Huh, huh, huh, huh. Well, I see your point. Huh, huh. It is a little dangerous. Huh, huh, huh, huh. Well, you don't have to do it. We can just use one of Gene's stuffed animals. I'm sure they're tired of being farted on. They love it. Huh, huh, huh, huh. Tina, people must know the truth. Do the reenactment. But what if I get electrocuted? Oh, come on, it's not that bad. But you died. Well, you don't have to rub it in. It's just, I'm not... What? Tina, tell my story. Also, you should wear your hair up sometimes, girlfriend. It looks really good. Okay, Topsy, I'll do it, but maybe not the hair thing. Oh, come on. It's just awkward with this length. Try it. See, I'm trying it right now. Look. You know what, wear it down. This is it. Today Edison and Dinkler are gonna get it right where the lightbulb don't shine. Are you sure you don't want music? Mm? No, no music, thank you. You had your chance and you blew it. Fine, then I quit! Suit yourself. Well, now I feel left out. Take me back. All right, you're rehired. Oh, thank God. Thank you. Teddy, what's our pyro status? Did you work out all the kinks? And by kinks I mean almost melting Tina. I think so, except for, uh... Nah, I'm sure it'll be fine. Huh, huh, huh. Tina, why are you making that noise? Huh, huh. Huh, huh. What is it, girl? Huh, huh. Oh, Tina's just pumped about the science fair. (whoops) Oh, wow, me, too. Is everybody ready to go? (bell jingles) Where's your father? Uh, here I am. What's all that? Uh, just some stuff I thought I'd bring to the science fair. (gasps) Are you bringing Spiceps? I just want some feedback, Lin. Who knows, maybe there's some wealthy parent that knows a good money-making venture when they see one. That's crazy. I'm going to get the Spice Rack. Oh, hello, Mr. Dinkler. What a day for science, huh? Teddy (over radio): Louise, give me the word when you want me to hit the switch. I know what you're doing, you hooligan. Jeremy saw everything last night. Oh, you son of a snitch! What's your favorite movie? Squeal Magnolias?! War Horse. You're trying to sully Edison's good name, and nobody messes with my man, Tom. You're banned. Get in there. You can't ban me from the science fair. So long, idiot. (chuckles) You're ruining my plan to humiliate you! Oh, oh-oh, oh. Whoop, oh, oopsie. Boy, that, uh, that fell over. Too bad. Aw. That's prime real estate. Watch out, someone's coming. Uh, uh, just checking out this great project. This must be a really smart kid, right? Not as smart as this kid right here; She's a genius. Oh, really? I think that kid stole this kid's idea and she should probably get a lawyer. Oh, he wouldn't dare. Oh, he would. I will destroy you. Hooray! Now that Louise is banned, I'm the only Edison project. Jeremy, shush. Right. Young man, I hear you wrote a love duet that dispels those nasty electrocution rumors and shows Edison's softer side. I think that's just what this science fair needs, and I want you to sing it. (gasps) Really? All right! What? I've got to call our landlord and my aunt and maybe some choir kids and maybe a couple of band geeks. If that's how you celebrate good news, sure. But, Gene, what about Louise? What about the truth? What did you say? I was just wondering if we need flutes. Who plays flute? Do you play flute? Teddy: Louise, some janitor just asked me what I was doing here. I panicked; I said I was a doctor. So if anyone asks, I'm Dr. Glen Wellness. I served in Korea. I handled a triage alone. Just if anyone asks. I delivered triplets in the back of a cab, if anyone asks. Ms. Schnurr, I want to say I totally understand why I'm in here. I was disrespectful. I was out of line, and oh, my God, did you move that picture? (screams) Wow. You are fast. I do martial arts. It shows. Hello, hi. Oh, aren't you short? Here, follow me. All right, let's show these people that if it ain't man-on-elephant love, it ain't worth singing about. (clears throat) Attention, everyone. We have a very special treat for you. It's a musical re-imagenactment of the very uplifting story of Thomas Edison and Topsy the elephant.

Tell her I've got to go to the fair. Tell her I've got to take Dinkler down. Shh, leave me out of it. You started it. I start, I don't finish things. That's my one flaw. So, how's that yogurt? Fine! Forget you! Forget all of you! Eat your yogurt! I'm busting out! (yells) Louise: Get everything ready, Teddy, because this is happening.

Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh. Oh! Tina! Tina! Tina? I'm okay. Oh! Oh, God. Oh, thank God. Tina. I thought we weren't doing the d*ath scene, but I saw the sparks and went with it. Was I convincing? Yes, very. Oh, my God, I almost electrocuted my sister. I've become Edison. Oh, you wish. So he electrocuted animals. (shocked murmuring) So what? As if everyone here is so perfect.

Could have asked me to sing, but whatever. You know, I could've sung it. Louise, is there something you want to say to your sister? Tina, I'm sorry I nearly k*lled you. I got carried away with the Dinkler thing, which worked out pretty well, but still, I shouldn't have almost k*lled you.

Oh, my God, I forgot the fart sounds! How'd we do? Well, you almost k*lled my daughter. So yeah, not great. Oh, wow, sorry about that. Hey, did you check out that Spiceps thing? Cool, huh? Really?

Open up, babies. Time for breakfast. Who wants Mommy's sausage? (chewing loudly) None for me, thanks. No sausage? What's wrong, sweetie? Today's the day I'm going to ask Jimmy Jr. to the dance. I don't want sausage sweats. Why? I'm wearing my sausage sweats right now. Aw, my baby's going to her first school dance. It's not that big a deal. I never went to a school dance. What? You never went to a school dance? No, I had other things to do. Like what, Dad? Well, I did leather-tooling. I made a belt. Somebody change the subject, somebody change the subject! Hey, I'm fine with it. I didn't miss out on dances. Those other kids missed out on leather. Aw, Bobby. That's what I love about you: all your sad stories. It's not sad. Hush, you're scaring Tina. Put that out of your head before you ask Jimmy Jr. Happy thoughts, happy thoughts. Leather belts. Sausage. Sausage belts. That's a great idea. (school bell ringing) Hi, Jimmy Jr. Oh, hey, Tina. Did you see those two squirrels fighting in the courtyard? Hey, speaking of the dance, are you planning on going? Am I going to the dance? Does this answer your question? Pyeah! Oh, that must be dancing for "yes." Yeah. Then, would you like to go to the dance with me? Uh, the best I can do now is a maybe. I want to know what all my options are first. That makes sense. Yeah, it does. Because, why tie yourself down now? Yeah. You know, you want to know all the girls that might be interested so you could weigh... Right. the pro... weigh them against each other. Okay, see you later. Okay, bye. Hey, Tina. Yeah? Ch-ah. What's that dancing for? Just... your skirt's stuck in your underwear. Oh, thanks for telling me. All right, fix it. Okay. ♪

I dance ballet. Oh, a bad boy. Cool. Who's this? I hope she's not another Toe 'Ho. A what Douglas. A dance groupie. These hangers-on, they really sap your energy. No, Douglas, this is Tina. I never thought I'd see her again. Oh, great. Hey, hey, Josh. I have to do a minute of handstands for extra credit. Can you time me? No, I'm-I'm kind of busy right now. I guess I'll just time myself, then. One, two, three, four, five, six... I haven't seen you since... Douglas, you got to stop, buddy, okay? Okay. I'm so sorry, Tina. What were you saying? I haven't seen you since... Since we kissed. On either side of the dairy case at Fresh Feed. It was hot. And cold. Why didn't you call me? No, I wrote down your number, but I put it in my dance pants and it got all sweaty. Dance pants. Yeah. Never put anything down dance pants. Mmm. Hey, I was just thinking, our school dance is Saturday. Will you come with me? Don't you want to know what your other options are? No, silly, I want to go with you. Well, that sounds fun, but my school dance is on Saturday, too, and today I got a soft maybe from a boy I asked. So... I'll have to let you know? That's totally fair. Here's my number. Oops, I lost it. (laughs) I know you're kidding. Yep, that's our chemistry. It sure is. Really cool chemistry, too. Douglas, please! Oh, I recognize that look. Somebody's going to the dance with Jimmy Jr. Yes, and it might be me. Jimmy Jr. gave me a maybe. All right! That's my little maybe baby. You're gonna be the prettiest girl at the dance, maybe. Just a maybe? When's he gonna give you a solid answer? Soon, I hope. Because Josh asked me to go to his school dance, too. Well, that's great. Go with the kid who's not stringing you along. Remember, Tina, a nerd in the hand is worth... not really that much, actually. Never mind. A yes is better than a maybe, sweetie. Don't end up like your father. Uh, what? Don't end up like your father. I guess you're right. But, I've logged over 3,000 fantasy hours on my relationship with Jimmy Jr. You don't just throw that away. (phone ringing) Bob's Burgers. Hello? We can do it? Yay. Oh, how exciting. No teens are gonna get pregnant on our watch. (laughs) I'll see you Saturday. Uh, what was all that? Get ready to shake it, Bobby. We're gonna chaperone Tina's dance. Narc! Chaperone? That's a horrible idea. Dad, your first dance. We can get ready together. Yeah, you can zip each other up. Uh... Hi, Jimmy Jr. I was wondering if you've decided who you're going to the dance with. Uh, no offense, Tina, but you're pressuring me right now, and guys don't like that. Well, then, maybe I'll go with the other boy who asked me. Wha...? Another boy? Oh, uh... I just decided. I'll go with you. Wait, you just decided you'll go with me because you found out this other boy wants to? (scoffs) That has nothing to do with it. Who is it? Lenny? No. I mean, he's good-looking, but he's not that good-looking. Plus, looks fade. It's not Lenny. Was it Nate? No. 'Cause he has herpes. So you're saying you want to go with me? Yes. And Josh wants to go with me. Choose me, Tina. I asked you first. But you asked me first. We've got chemistry. I've got a butt. Look at it. I asked you and only you. As far as you know. What? He said, "As far as you know." No, I didn't. You said it. Don't worry about who said it. Just watch the butt. Jimmy Jr., I just decided. I'm going to the dance with... Josh. (sighs) Well, would you at least think about changing your mind? As a handsome dancer once said, "Maybe." You're-you're the handsome dancer. Jimmy Jr. had a chance to hitch his trailer to the Tina truck, but now it's headed down the highway to Joshville. Honk, honk. Two boys like Tina at the same time? And one of them's not even papier-matcher, like Roberto was. What happened to Roberto? Did you try to shower with him? Yeah. Maybe. Well, good for you, Tina. When I see Jimmy Jr. at the dance on Saturday, I'm gonna tell him, "Go do your 'you had your chance dance,' buddy." Wait-wait a minute. Now we're chaperoning a dance Tina's not even going to? We're not doing it for her, Bobby. We're doing it for you. I really wish we weren't doing it for me. Oh, wake up, we do everything for you. Dad, if you believe you're beautiful, you will be. I did. But maybe we can do something about that hair. Did you wash it? Walk home with us, Tina. There's just something about your smell that keeps the mean dogs away. Not today. Josh is coming to pick me up. Louise (laughing): Tights. Tina, is he a superhero? Hey, Tina. Hey, Josh. So, I'm here to pick you up. Whoa, careful! Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Get it? I literally picked you up. It was like being on a romantic stool. Yeah, well, that was just a stool sample. There's more where that came from. Ten bucks says you can't lift Gene. Toss me into a tree, then tell everyone I climbed it myself like a normal boy. Wait, wait, wait. Pick me up, pick me up. Here we go. Put me down! Put me down! Okay, now, now you're down! And now you're down. That was cool. (scoffs) Lifting a girl. Big deal. I'm sorry. You are? Better than you. And what? This is Jimmy Jr., the other boy who asked me to a dance. This is Josh, the other boy who asked me to a dance. I'm Zeke. I'm going stag. So you dance, huh? On those twigs? (laughing): You just got J-Ju-ed. Whoa, guys, slow down. Is this really worth it? (moans) Come on, Tina. We've got reservations at a frozen yogurt stand. Ha, can't afford regular yogurt. I can't believe Tina found another dancer. She's rubbing that guy's feet in my face. Uh-oh. Somebody's as jealous as a bald guy in a mop factory. I'm not jealous, Zeke. I just don't! Like! That guy! Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Calm down, now. You want her back, we'll get her back. You think so, Zeke? I don't know, but maybe. Well, you just said... Oh, just trust me! Well, well... Kind of. It's so hard when two boys want you. You seem to be kind of enjoying all this attention, Tina. Come on, Bob. Tina had a long wait till she got to the buffet. Let her pig out. I'm just saying, you shouldn't string boys along. It's not right. You can't just tell a boy on the steps of Buchanan Middle Schoo 30 years ago that you're not going to the dance with him when you said you would. Whoa. What happened, Bob? Yeah, Dad, open that wound. Let's poke around in there. All right, all right. Bob: I was 13, and I just spent my allowance on a corsage. Gene: Idiot. Hey, Becky. I got you this corsage. It goes really nice with your... other corsage? Yeah, Curt gave it to me. Hey. Oh, hey, Curt. 'Sup? Sorry, I didn't know how to tell you. I thought this would be easiest. Yeah, yeah, this is, um... this is really easy, Becky. Thanks. Oh, well. I'll see you inside. Great belt. Great neck. What'd you say? Uh... nothing. Curt: Yeah, that's what I thought. Your fly's down. No, it isn't. (blows raspberry, laughs) Oh, got me. Yep. Is this stuff really important to the story, Dad? Aw, Bobby. That settles it. We're gonna make up for that awful, terrible night and all your other missed dances, Bobby. That's not why I told the story, Lin. This is gonna be the biggest, glitziest, Bobby-est school dance ever. And if there's a chaperone king, it's gonna be you. There's no such thing as a chaperone king. Well, there wasn't a raccoon king in our alley until I went out there and picked my favorite one. (laughs) His name's Little King Trash Mouth. He's gay. He's gay? Yeah. Why? He's got a boyfriend. They just got married. Hmm. Wha...? (mumbling) All right, J-Ju, get your net ready. We're about to hook us a trout called Tina. Hey, Tina. Hi, Jimmy Jr. What's up, girl? (grunting) I got you! I got you! (grunting) Come on! Uh-oh, J-Ju's starting to rally. Oh, he beat me. Oh, look at this boy. Look at that r-raging testosterone just throbbing out of him. (screaming) Ah, yeah. How you like my boy now, lady? Ah, I got mad. My main man's a crazy man. I know what you're doing, Jimmy Jr. You're trying to get me to go to the dance with you. Well, try again. I mean it, try again. Um... right now? No, later. Just do something without Zeke. Well, if that didn't work, nothing will. Sorry, J-Ju. Now let's finish what we started! No, Zeke! Ow! You little son of a b1tch! Hey, guys has, um... Tina been talking about me at all? Um, no. Tough break, Jr. Tough break. Hey, will you guys help me get her back? We'll help you, for a price. Can you really put a price on love? Yes, you can. It's $20. Okay, just tell me what to do, and I'll do it. Anything. Hey, but don't let Tina know. Jimmy Jr., please. We are professional and discreet. We would never tell her.

How about, uh, Earlobes and uh, Back Hair? Don't tell me they're into it. You don't want to know how into it they are. That is unbelievable. Oh, it's not funny, Bob. It's gross. No, Lin, it's really funny. Ma, this is wh... Why would you want to do that? Why would you want to live here? (gagging) Because the other places were horrible! Old people waiting to die. This place, the people are alive. They're really alive. (laughing): That's amazing. Stop it! We thought, if swinging is part of it, why not give it a try? Then we moved here, and your father got cold feet. Good for your feet, Dad. Eh? It's not good! It's not good, Al! No! (mutters) Can I have a graham cracker, Helen? Get your own. You know, we could become professional python bounty hunters. We could move here and start our own reality TV show. We could call it Snake it to the Limit. Or So You Think You Can Snake. Or Snake and Bake, if we baked the snake after we caught it. Hey, I'm paying you kids to track, not yak. Hey, don't get your tights in a bunch, Helen. We're gonna find that snake. See ya, Gene. Can I have some melon? No. (grunts) (animals chittering) There must be millions of places in here where that snake could hide. Okay, maybe not millions. Let's try that again. Florida's weird. What's going on? You just left. Ugh. Let us work, Helen! Then work! We're working! God! (grunts) Ow. Ha! You missed! Yeah, you missed. Wait. Ugh. I don't want all these old horny toads anywhere near my parents. I can't believe they got mixed up in all this. Easy, Lin. Your parents are adults. It's really none of our business. I'm telling everybody when we get home. Ugh! I can't get the image out of my mind. A bunch of naked old people all in a... yuck, naked. Oh, hi, kids! Hey. All in a what? Uh... look, over there! What? I got you. (laughs) Huh. Go to bed. All of you. Bed now. Actually, we were thinking we'd camp out tonight in the parking lot by the woods. Grandpa Al said we could use his tent. Huh? In the parking lot? Away from this? That's great! Yeah, great! But if anyone invites you to a potluck, run away. There's a potluck?! You would not like it. Really? What do you mean? It's hard to explain why you wouldn't like it. Well, give me some ideas. I love the idea of everyone bringing a dish. Linda: Oh, God! Don't do it while we're here, please! Ugh! Oh! Linda, we've been served with a Notice of Failure to Perform. What? Failure? W-Why? Wha...? Your parents RSVP'd "no" to the potluck. It's clear they have no intention of taking part fully in the activities here. And those who don't play can't stay. Eh. They can't? Tonight's potluck was their third strike. They also missed the Best Ball golf outing and the South of the Border fish taco night. Ugh! Oh! Wait. So you're kicking them out for not going to your parties? You can do that? It's in our bylaws, large print edition. You've got to be part of the community. Well, these pots are keeping their lids on! Stay away from their beef and noodles! (sighs) I'm going to bed. I hope you're better at finding snakes than pitching tents, because you stink. Well, I hope you're good at finding your purse and ponying up that hundred bucks. I got the money. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah! Yeah?! Let me see it! Hey, don't you worry. I'm good for it. Just put ten dollars in my hand. Good night. Good night, Helen. Sweet dreams, okay? I love you, Helen! And I love your money! Uh, it's getting dark. I better go in the tent and do base camp stuff. (Gene yelling) Oh, no! The tent's running away. Oh, get back here with base camp, Gene! I don't want to! Helen said she'll get you crackers! Helen: No, I didn't! Oh, go to bed, already! Linda: Don't you worry, Mom. I'm sure you and Dad can find a nice retirement community. One where a porch swing is something you sit on and not strap into. I sat on that. It was weird. We won't be able to afford to live in a retirement community. Or even an apartment. (sighs) What? Why? Why? If we get kicked out, we'll have to forfeit our down payment. (gasps) No. Well, you know what I'm thinking. No, no. You could always... No, no, no. No. ...move in... No, no. ...with us. (yelling) No! Gene: What kind of animal was that? Stop being scared, okay? You're gonna spook Tina. I'm not spooked. What's the thing after spooked? I'm that. Wait, wait! Let's all stay in the tent. Let's order tent service! I'll get... Ooh. Ooh, this is hard. I'll get the Cobb salad and... What do you guys want? Okay, I'll just put you down for some spicy wings and, like, a dill salmon. What else? Guys! Guys! (Tina shouts) Shh! Did you say "shh"? Or did the snake say "sss"? (rustling) What was that? (Tina shouts) Aah! Qu-Quit shining the light in my eyes! Whoops. I think something's on me. Is there something on me? Uh, yes. It's either a feather or a scorpion. (shouting) Get it off! Tina, stop! Stop! I'll get it! No, no, no, no, no! Now I can't see the scorpion! (shouts) Drop and roll! Drop and roll! (shouts) Maybe it was a feather. Just think feather. I hate feathers. Bob: Oh, God. Oh. Oh, stop it. Oh, no. If they need a place to live they will live with us, Bob! Case closed! Well, why can't they live with your sister? Her life is already ruined. Gayle has a studio apartment. We have three kids and one bathroom. Not another word, Bob. If they get kicked out of here, then they are staying with us. Well, then they are not going to get kicked out of here. What? Bob, Excuse me. Bob, where are you going? Nowhere. What are you doing? Nothing. Bob. (sighs) Sheesh. Bye. Louise: Snake-hunter to Snake-wuss. Over. Snake-wuss to... Hey. We're lost, our flashlights are gone and we can't find our way out of the woods, which is possibly full of scorpions... or feathers. Over. Follow the sound of my voice! It's on the walkie-talkie, Gene. Then follow your heart. You can't go wrong! Shush! Just shush! Tina, let's think. Is there such a thing as night butterflies? Please say yes. (both shouting) Tina: It could still be butterflies. No, they're not. Hi, Al. Eh. Bob: Looks like a pretty fun party. (groans) I mean, look, all you got to do is show up, right? And then they'll let you stay. Show up and... and play. Well, yeah, but, you know, that's why you came here, right? I mean, you must have been excited about it at some point. What-what happened? I saw all these other fellas. They're just a bunch of... peacocks. Mmm. Oh. Y-You don't want to be the last breadstick in the basket, huh? Ah. (sputters) There's, uh... breadstick pills, you know? Doc won't let me take those pills. Bad heart... and kidney... liver... Right. And leg pains and dry mouth. W-Well, what else gets you going? Is there anything you're into? Like, uh... I don't know... uh, feet or something? (groans) Leather? (groans) Spanking? Eh. Um, I don't really know any others. Well, there's one thing. Gloria doesn't know. What? What-what is it? Eh. F-Forget it. You can tell me, Al. (mumbling): Balloons. What? Balloons! Um, that's great. I... Wait. What is that? I like... to watch a woman inflate a balloon and then sit on it till it pops. It drives me cra-crazy. No, that's... I mean, that's what you're into. Yeah, but Gloria hates loud noises. It'd never work. Uh, does it have to pop? Yes! Pop! Pop! Yes! What... Where'd-where'd you see that first? World Wide Web. Uh-huh. Uh, I've... I'll have to, um... I'll check it out. You just... You just, uh... www-dot... Mm-hmm. Women-inflates-a-balloon-and- sits-on-it-and-pops-it-dot-com. Yeah. Catchy name. (groans) How are we still in here? This is the tiniest forest in the world! All of a sudden I feel slower. And shorter. We're in a mud hole. That's it! I hate Florida! Gene, come help us! We're gonna drown in mud if the snake doesn't eat us first. I don't believe you. Send me a picture of you in the mud holding today's newspaper. Until you do, I am turning off the walkie-talkie. Gene, don't do it! Don't do it! He did it. You're dead to me, Gene! And we'll be dead, too, so it's complicated. Help! Help! Louise: Help! Help! (Tina yells) ♪ I'm not afraid of ghosts ♪

So, uh... so, what are you doing? Dishes? Yeah. I guess I'm gonna have to pack this place up. Well, actually, maybe not. Guess who's been talking to Al about s*x parties? Who? This guy. And guess who found out Al's secret kink that even you didn't know about? Who? Me. I did. Right here. What is it? Well, the answer may startle you. Literally. Do you have any earplugs or headphones? And balloons? Huh? And something to share, 'cause it's a potluck. So we should whip something up. What do you got in the fridge? Uh... Can't hold on much longer. Tina, help me record my last will and testament. If you're watching this, I'm dead. And I only have a few things to say. Don't touch my stuff! No one gets anything! I leave it all to my ghost!

I've seen it, and I'm not impressed. Yellow Belly! Gene! Your belly's not as yellow as I thought. What happened? I didn't want to be an only child. They're always weird. Gene mowed us a path. Drive us out of here. (snarling) (all shouting) (all panting) I hate Florida. I hate Florida. I hate it, I hate it, I hate it. Louise: Wh. Look. Bitsy's tutu. Ah. Yeesh. This must be the place the snake comes to digest its prey. (rustling) (all shout) (bark) (barking) (panting, barks) It's Bitsy! He passed right through the snake without being digested! Like that time I swallowed a button! This button. (barks) Where are my parents? Um, getting ready for the party. What?! Al: Wha...? What is going on? (gags) What?! Go! Go, you two. Have fun. Okay. What?! Okay, bye! Al: Eh. We're going now! Bye-bye. Al: Thank you, Bob. No problem, Al. Oh, no. I wasn't talking to you. (chuckling): Oh. Bob, you tell me what is happening right now. Al finally got into the swing of things. They're going to the party, which means they won't be kicked out, which means I'm a hero. Oh, you're a hero 'cause you got my parents to go to a s*x party?! Well, maybe not a hero, but, uh, eh. Great, so they get to stay here and get passed around like hors d'oeuvres?! With crabs! In their crotches! Linda, look at them. (moaning, smacking) Oh, my God. They haven't kissed each other in 20 years. Ooh, it shows. I'm sure they'll get better at it. Huh. I guess if you love something, you let it go swing. What's with the balloons? Oh, it's a long story. Actually, I kind of want to try something. Does this do anything for you? (balloon pops) Ooh! Maybe... Louise: Well, I guess the only python was in Helen's head. "Snakes on a brain." Am I right? Yes, you are correct! I can hardly wait to see the look on Helen's face when we reunite her with Bitsy. (doorbell rings) Oh, you again. What do you got? Get your purse out, Helen. Better yet, go to the bank and open up your safe... we've got good news. You got the snake? Better. (barking) Bitsy! (laughing, kissing) Oh, what happened to your clothes? Let's get you into your big-dog pants. (barks) Come back! (barking) Bitsy! Maybe he doesn't like wearing clothes. With that body, I wouldn't either. (growls) Helen: Bitsy! Oh, man. We're never gonna get our hundred bucks now. Bitsy! (crying) Bitsy seemed really happy in there, if it makes you feel any better. Oh, yeah? (crying) Uh, Bitsy! Whatever you want to do, I support you!

(car engine grinding, not turning over) Bob, we're gonna miss the beginning of the movie. Plus, I'm smuggling chocolate in my pants. We got to get there before it melts. I'm gonna get it. Just a sec. Ugh! Can you roll down the windows back here? I'm starting to breathe in Tina's breath. I can't. They're broken. I think I forgot to brush this morning. Did I? (exhales loudly) Yeah. Yeah, you did. Jimmy: Hey, who am I? (imitates engine not starting) (clicks tongue rhythmically) I'm Bob's car! (laughter) Good one, J.P. Uh, not a good one, Jimmy. (engine starts, Bob laughs) Started right up. They went inside, Dad. Oh. Ugh! Start driving! Gene just took off his shoes! And my socks! Louise: Why don't you wash your children? (engine knocking, stalls) Oh, great. Can't I just take my family to a stupid movie? Dog Prom 3D is not a stupid movie! Are we gonna just leave our car there like that? That's what we're gonna do when Dad and Mom break down. Leave them by the side of the road! Hey, guys, you want to see a live TV show taping? Do I! Give me that. "Come to a taping of Family Fracas." What's Family Fracas? It's a game show where they make families do weird stuff and then dump foam all over them. I'm into weird stuff and foam. Can we go? We should go home and call a tow truck. The car's not going anywhere, Bobby. Come on, it'll be fun. Please, Dad? Please, Dad! Come on! Come on, come on. Come on. Kids: Please! Please! Oh, look! Pam's Court! I love the way she bangs that gavel. Bang! Aah!- Hey, isn't that Pam's ex-husband Chuck? Oh, my God. What's he doing here? Aah! Oh, hey, Chuck. Hello, Belchers. Long time no see since you got my show canceled and me fired. A boobity boobity boobity boo! Linda, nice to see you dressed again. Thank you. Yeah. Sorry about that. It... (laughs) Water under the bridge, Bob. Oh, good. Dark, dirty water. Under a horrible bridge. Um... Oh, but all is well now. You're looking at the new host of Family Fracas! Chuck, we got a problem. The Morgan family just dropped out of the show. Aah. Food poisoning. Gross! We got to find another family of five in the next ten minutes. But how the heck are we gonna do that? The heck right here. Yeah! We're a family of five. No, we're not. One, two, three, four. Oh, yes we are! Harry, this is a bad idea. No idea's a bad idea. I like this guy! I... I don't know. Grand prize is a brand-new minivan. Oh! Wh... whoa! Dad, this is a no-brainer. Dad, come on! No, no. No, no, no. Bobby! If we win the minivan, we can put the car out of its misery. No. What the hell. Let's do it! No! Fantastic! Hooray for Family Fracas! Male Announcer: It's time for Family Fracas! Here's your host... Chuck Charles! (applause and cheering) Hiya, folks! Western Med... Whoa. Is that Bob? Let's welcome back the reigning champs, the O'Donnell family! And competing against the O'Donnells are the Belchers. Hi! Hi, Linda. Look. Tina's on Family Fracas. My cousin was gonna be on that show, but he didn't want to wear that outfit. I don't blame him. Belchers, introduce yourselves. Uh, well, I'm Bob, and this is my wife Linda. Don't look at my hair. I didn't know I was gonna be on TV. And this is my daughter Louise. It's Louise! * And she is gonna win. * Okay, okay, okeydoke. And that one. That's Gene. Camera, take the day off! I added ten pounds to myself! And the last one's Tina. Hi. I'm Tina. I like horses, music and boys. (whispering): Hi, boys. I'm Tina. Okay, that's more than enough. All right, let's get Frackin'! It's time for the Brain Drain! Well, it looks like these guys have lost their marbles. The first team to fill their brain with these wins the challenge. And what does the other team get? All: Foamed! That's right... foamed. On your mark, get set, go! (gasps) Are you trying to distract me by holding my hand? Huh, what? Owen, I feel it, too. But right now, we're competitors. I can't be sweet on you before I beat on you. Tina, marble me! Oh, right. Done! (buzzer sounds, Tina and Gene groan) (applause and cheering) I ate it! I ate it! Num, num, num. I like it! First team to remove all the flies from their soup wins. Losing team gets... face full of foam! All right, Mom, you ready? You pumped? Yeah! Slap my face! What? Slap it! Oh, uh... I'll slap yours. Oh, uh, I'm pumped! I'm pumped! And... go! (groaning) Done! Aha! Yeah! Foam time! (buzzer sounds) The Belchers and the O'Donnells are tied. Whoever wins the Human Claw challenge wins the whole game. (applause and cheering) I can smell that minivan. I call shotgun! I call optional third row. Ugh! The whole third row. Children, shut up, shut up, shut up! And Bob and Pat are gonna get dunked into a pit full of blue balls. The first one to find a yellow ball wins. But they have to grab the ball with their teeth. Families, you control the crane. No crane, no gain, am I right? (bell dings) I am right! (laughter) My harness is a little tight around the groin... Go! Aah! (Bob groans) (applause and cheering) Come on, Dad! Make us proud for once! (bell dinging) I got one! I got one! Dad won! Ha, ha, ha! Ha, ha! Well, bash my head in with a brick. The Belchers won. We won! We won! Yah! Yes! Yay! All right! Yay, Bobby! Wow, Tina won. (speaking gibberish) Honk, honk, honk! O'Donnells, we are really sorry to see you go. You are good people. Bye, Joey and Owen! You're leaving in shame, but you played a good game. (whispering): They were terrible. And now the Belchers are gonna spin the prize wheel for a chance to win a brand-new minivan! (audience sighs and gasps) I got this. (groans) Come on, come on, come on, minivan. Oh, hey, a five-gallon bucket of Fracas foam, so you can get foamed at home. Home foam! No! Yes! It tastes good. Trust me. The Belchers will return tomorrow as the champs and have another sh*t at the minivan. Hey! We're coming back! That's exactly what I just said. Put your hands together for the winning family! (applause and cheering) You hear that? We're the winning family! Yes, they all hear that! I have a microphone. Congratulations to the most annoying winning family in Fracas history. We won most annoying! Yeah! Hi, Ma! You guys, this is so much better than the minivan. Mmm. Gene, stop eating that crap. You're just jealous that I have frothy diarrhea. Come on, you big idiot. (whistling) * La, la, la... Hey, Jimmy, did you happen to catch Family Fracas last night? 'Cause we were on it, and we won. Oh yeah, is that the show where the most pathetic family wins? (laughing) No, no. No, it isn't, Jimmy. Why don't you watch it tonight? I'll send you a shout out. Oh, yeah, why don't you watch this? Hey, I'm Bob! I'm on a game show! Blah, blah, blah! I... I don't want to watch that. I'm gonna change the channel with my remote that I have. Click! I'm still Bob, and I'm still on... Wait, wait, wait. Click. This channel. I just shut you off! I just shut you off... And I'm on that. So you can't say anything! Now I'm on shut off channel. I shut you off! Belchers, meet your competition... the Changs. Hey. Everybody Chang sons tonight. Oh, dear lord. Oh, my gosh, there's Pam! Hi, Pam! I mean, Your Honor. Chuck. I see you're working with these nice folks again. How fun for you!

And Belchers. But mostly Changs. (applause and cheering) And go! Yeah, Dad, grab those balls! Linda: Yeah! I got one! (bell dinging) Oh! So sorry, Joe. Bob's little rat snout found the ball first, which means the Belchers win! (whooping) All right! Did you just say rat snout? Let me at that wheel! (applause and cheering) Stay! Stay! Stay! Stay! Stay! (audience groans) Foam again?! Uh, Chuck, can I give someone a shout out? Absolutely not. Jimmy Pesto's an idiot! The end. Tough shout out. Hmm. Thanks for sharing, Bob.

  (both shout) Damn it! (laughs) Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa. (grunts) (grunts) You hit my eye! Here. Now we're twins again! Done! (groans) Yes! (both shout) Oh, what's the point of having twins if they can't hit each other with eggs like they were supposed to? The Belchers and Pestos are neck and neck. It's anybody's game as we head into the Human Claw! Have fun losing, Jimmy. (mocking sounds) Well said, Jimmy. Ready, set, grab that ball! (grunts) (audience cheering) We have a winner! Huh? GENE/TINA/LOUISE: No! What just happened? We lost to the Pestos. (sighs) We had a good run. And that's from a kid who hates running. (laughing) I'm so sorry, Bob. The Pestos are the new champs of Family Fracas! (Pestos cheering) Uh, can you lower me down now? We're trying! It's stuck, Bobby! Chuck, the crane is stuck. Bob, just a second. (laughs) And the Pestos win a brand-new minivan! Oh! Trev: Oh! Oh! Jimmy: Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Pull! Kids, stop. Don't do that. Stop! No, no, no! (all gasp) Gene: Oh, boy. Louise: Oh, Dad. Oh! Ew! (laughter) Chuck: Oh, that's too bad. Let's give the Belchers a big Family Fracas bye-bye! Audience: Bye-bye, Belchers! Bye! What? I'm saying good-bye. I know what you're all thinking... not only did we lose to the Pestos but I also humiliated myself. Correct. I was thinking that. Well, you're right. I blew it. At least we have all this stupid foam. Aw, Bobby. I'm gonna get rid of this Fracas foam. I'm gonna flush it down the toilet. Bye. No! You can't! It's true. It says right there you can't. Oh. Hey, Dad, want a little good news? You're about to go viral. Stop! (audience gasps) Chuck: Oh, that's too bad. (laughs) His pants come off every time. Thanks a lot, guys. Thanks for helping me get past this. No problem. How did Jimmy find that ball in two seconds? It's almost impossible. Bob, stop obsessing. It's over. (groans) This is the fifth time he's circled the block. Jimmy, I get it. You won the minivan. Face it, Bob. You were destined to lose. I knew it, Chuck sure knew it. Wh... what do you mean, "Chuck sure knew it"? What does that mean? What? Nothing. I... I have a disease where I say things, you know, and it makes me drive away... Hmm. (audience cheering) We have a w... We have a w... Dad, if you watch the video in reverse your pants go back on. Thanks, Louise. I'm just watching Jimmy. It's like he knew exactly where to find the yellow ball. And I have a hunch Chuck told him where to look. Watch. (audience cheering) We... Did you see that? Yeah. Wait, what was I supposed to see? He barely fished for it. He cheated. We were wronged. Look, there are a lot of things this family's terrible at. That's true. We were really good at Family Fracas. And if we're gonna lose, I want to lose fair and square. Not because that jerk Pesto cheated. Hey, Dad, can we put a pin in this? We're running late. For what? For the Pesto's minivan. Jimmy Jr.'s having a screening of dirty dancing: Havana Nights. What? No! Didn't you hear what I just said? That's the van of a cheater! What are we supposed to do, Dad? Watch the TV here? That thing makes me sick! You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna drive down to the studio... Gene: The car's broken, Dad! Damn it! I'm gonna walk to the studio and talk to those people face-to-face! You, you, not you and you. Tina, what are you doing here? We're here for the screening. Yeah, let us in. Let's do this. Come on. I don't know, Tina. You said some pretty mean things on Family Fracas yesterday. We'll take that popcorn though. Thank you. Jimmy Jr., wait! What you saw before was my game face. This is my normal face. Let us in! Oh, you're getting a banana in your tailpipe. Oh... And I am not talking about the van. Oh! Bob: I think Jimmy Pesto cheated at the Human Claw game. Hmm. You do? Yes, and I... I think Chuck might've helped him. Hmm... Um, what's happening right now? Here's the thing, Bob. I believe you believe you were wronged. Thank you? This is big. Yes. And I could make it a lot bigger. Yes! Wait, what do you mean? I'm talking about Bob versus Chuck on Pam's Court. Um, no. I don't want to do that. How 'bout I just go to a real court with real lawyers? That costs serious dough. You don't have it. What makes you say that? Those stains, your smells, you walked here, your children, you're not wearing any jewelry. Aw, crap. All right, Pam's Court. Let's do it. All right! Congratulations, Bob. The Belchers are back on TV! You know what that rhymes with? Uh... Long lsland lced Tea. I'm gonna have one. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. You have a bar in your desk? You don't have a bar in your desk? (slurping) I'm gonna leave you alone. Thank you. (slurping) (theme music plays) Pam: Order. Announcer: This is the courtroom of Judge Pam. I'll allow it. And Judge Pam has the final word. Guilty. Not guilty. We'll see you in court. Judge Pam's court. I sentence you to stay tuned. In a very special episode of Pam's Court, burger man Bob Belcher is suing Jimmy Pesto and Pam's ex-husband and new host of Family Fracas, Chuck Charles. This is the case of the Great Balls of lre. All rise. Pam's Court is now in session. You may be seated. So, someone else besides me is accusing Chuck of cheating. Mr. Belcher, you claim that Chuck helped Jimmy Pesto cheat at Family Fracas. Uh, yes, Your Honor. At the Human Claw game, which I happen to be pretty good at. Do you have any evidence to support your claim? Uh, yes, I do, Your Honor. Jimmy said Chuck, quote, "sure knew I was gonna lose." Now, I ask the court, how was Chuck so sure? Mr. Pesto, did you say this? Yeah. I said it. Aha! So he admits it! Yeah, I admit that you lost. And no one was surprised. Your Honor, the prosecution clearly has no case. I hate to agree with the defense, and also, I hate the defense and his smug face, and his misshapen pen1s. Ho-ho-ho-ho! Well, it pleased the court. The court was faking it. (laughs) I don't think so. You shut up. No, you shut up. Shut your mouth. Shut your mouth. I will jump over there, and shut it for you. Edit that out. Do you have any other evidence, Mr. Belcher? You bet he does! You got something, right? Come on, give it to 'em. Actually, I... I don't. I... I... thought, uh... that when I said that one thing he would just confess. Bobby, that's all you got? Quick! Let's call a surprise witness! Who? I call Henry Kissinger to the stand! Order! I think I have my ruling. Announcer: Will Bob's beef be settled? Lettuce find out after the break. (buzzer sounds) Bob, we're gonna lose this case. Jimmy cheated, Lin. I know it. Hey, we're on TV. We know, Tina. We're on Pam's Court. Pretty neat, huh? It's a TV show. No, we're on that TV. Hi. Wait a sec. That's it! What? And we're back in three, two... I went to my chambers and reviewed this case. Objection! You did not! You were here. You were putting on makeup the whole time. You don't even need makeup, on. Oh, thank you. Linda: You're beautiful. And that robe... Pam: You're wonderful. I'd love to see you without makeup though to be honest. Moving on! In the case of Great Balls of lre, I rule that... Bob: Wait, Your Honor! I... I have new evidence. I can prove my case. Go on. These cameras, they're always rolling. Right? Correct. A... and the same with the cameras on Family Fracas, right? Uh-oh. One of those cameras may have caught Chuck helping Jimmy cheat. The Foam Cam! Dad, the Foam Cam is on the ceiling! I never forget a camera that feeds me. Objection! Objection! Hearsay! Inadmissible... hears-say... Overruled! Bring me the Foam Cam tape. Does this mean we're gonna win? I sure hope so, Tina. Good. Psst. Your ass is grass. And I'm gonna mow it. Leave me alone! Hey, so we... can't show that tape. Oh, you did help Jimmy cheat. Shh! Yes. Yes! And I had to get rid of the Belchers. You gave me no choice. I put the ball in Jimmy's mouth. You put it in your mouth and then you kissed it into his mouth. What? No. I put it into his mouth with my hand. Huh. That's one way to do it. I'll take that. Ha! There's the evidence, idiot. Ha, you're the idiot. What do we do? I'm not gonna let the host of one of my shows lose a trial on another one of my shows. Hey! What are you doing? Whoops. Ah, Judge Pam, did you see that? Huh? See what? I saw it! The evidence must be on that tape. Which means Dad was right. Yes! What is going on with my lighter right now? It's burning this tape. What the hell? He's burning the tape! Pam? You know what to do. Right. Without any actual evidence, I have to rule in favor of the defense. Yes! Oh, yeah! Justice! (buzzer sounds) What's going on? Why are we getting foamed? This is a court show. The losers get foamed on Pam's Court. That's insane. They have foam on all their shows on this channel. Oh, no friggin' way! I want my minivan! All right, you're gonna have to sit down. (screams) Down you go. I will kick you in the jaw. I will... Just put my hand on your throat, and down you go. What're we gonna do now? Nothing. We lost. But Jimmy and Chuck cheated. Doesn't matter. We were never gonna win this case. This whole thing was fixed. Let's just go home and... and never watch any shows on Channel 13 again! Oh come on, you don't mean that. Yes I do! I might watch a little bit of Pam's Court. Just a little bit. When are we getting the car back, Dad? I don't know. The mechanic called yesterday but I never called him back. I thought we were gonna win the minivan. That van is dead to me! Look, there it is. Louise: Oh, I love it so much. Oh, problem with the van, Jimmy? What? It's nothing. Damn it! You don't know how to change a tire. Ha! You don't know how to change a tire. Hey. Who am I? "I can't change a tire and my whole family is watching me not be able to do something simple." You are mean. Yeah, Bob. Geez, Dad. What? He's the one who said it to us when our car wouldn't start. Yeah, but he was funny. He was funnier? Mm-hmm. Yeah. No. Yeah. No. Mm-hmm. No, he wasn't. He kind of was. Are you... zll right, let me help. Move over. "Let me help. Move over." He just did it again! "He just did it again." He's doing it right now! "He's doing it right now." Linda: Oh, yeah, it's funny. (Pam's Court theme music plays) Pam: Order. I'll allow it. Guilty. Not guilty. ♪ I think I have my ruling. Moving on. Right.
Gene, you almost done scraping the gum off the bottom of the counter? Yeah! And I'm almost done with Gumhead. Here you go, Gumhead. Num, num, num, num, num, num! More gum! Gene, knock it off. I know you think you're helping, but you're not. I don't think I'm helping. All right, step right up. Which cup is the creamer under, Tina? Keep your eye on the creamer, little lady. Where's it going? Where's it going? Louise. Yeah, Dad? Do you know where the cream is? No. All right, then stay out of it. Is it here? Is it this one? Is it that one? Uh... Huh, huh, huh, huh. This one? Wrong! Now you have to drink it. Ugh. Okay. Tina, Louise, enough, and get back to work. This is a big weekend for us. It's Fleet Week! Yay! Feet Week! No. Fleet Week. Why would there be a Feet Week? I don't know. There's Arbor Day. Who needs that? Any minute now, sailors will be pouring through that door, wanting burgers and beer. Mostly beer, but still. Excuse me, sir, but I need to inspect your table for gum. Gene, get out of there. No! Gumhead needs lips! Give me the Gumhead. Mm, no! Give me your Gumhead! I'm sorry, sir. Gene! Give me back my son! I just need to breathe life into him! All right, Tina, new game, new game. Keep your eye on the cream. Try not to blink. Gene, don't hit your mother. Linda, don't kick him! You missed it! Wrong! Drink it! Drink it! Louise? Uh, check, please? Gene? Aah! Damn it! I cut my hand! Oh, somebody pee on it! I just went pee! This is a disaster! Oh. Never mind. It's okay. I'm not bleeding. False alarm. Phew! You had me worried there. You get so woozy when you bleed. Remember that time he flossed? He passed out right into the toilet. Oh, whoa, whoa. Wait. That's why I never floss. Blood is your teeth's way of saying, "Mind your own business!" I only floss on my birthday... Guys. ...so I can look back on the year and remember what I ate. Plus, he can't clot to save his life. He bleeds forever. It's gross. I'm act... I'm actually bleeding here. (distorted): Bobby? You... okay? I'm fine. It's just a little bluh... (Bob sighs) What am I doing down here? You passed out, Dad. No, I didn't. Pretty sure you did. Maybe you took a little catnap. I didn't pass out, Tina. Aw, my little Wobbly Bobbly. Hmm. Oh, crap. All right. We got to finish prepping for the lunch rush. Uh-uh. No, I'll be fine, Lin. I don't know. You got cut right in the old finger crotch. Oh, no! Not the family finger crotch jewels! Guys, I said it's fine. It's not even... (mumbling): No. Oh, God. Okay, okay, let's go. (groans) You're not gonna stop bleeding. Okay, I-I might need a couple stitches. Linda, you have to stay for the lunch rush. I'll drive myself. It's not gonna be a prob... (mumbles) Oh! Oh, you're not driving. Come on, give me the keys. We'll just have to close for lunch. We'll be back in a few hours. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! We could run the restaurant. No, no. Yeah, we can do it. We'll just tell people that Dad's in the shower and Mom's on the toilet. Why do I have to be on the toilet? Fine, you can both be on the toilet. And Dad went out for a pack of smokes and never came back. No, no, no. We're closing the restaurant and we're going to the hospital, all right? Kids, upstairs. Tina, you're babysitting. Countdown to babysitting. Excitement begins now. 100, 99, 98... Four, three, two, one. Who's ready for some fun? I can't hear you. I'd be open to fun. Let's see here. We can play Torpedo, Surgery Sam, or if we need to blow off some steam, we can make a get-well card for Dad. "Happy stitches, Dad. You deserve it." Or how about, "Stitch, please!" Ugh, I don't want to make cards. I want to make money! I say we go down there, and we open up for business. Yeah. But Mom and Dad will be home in an hour. Maybe we could play pretend restaurant? I'm restocking the napkin dispenser. Gene, you go clean the floors. If we're pretending, I'm... I'll make fresh mozzarella. We're not making money in this fake restaurant, Tina! Not yet, but we're building good pretend word of mouth. Oh! This is gonna be the longest hour of my life. Wait till childbirth, girlfriend. In and out, two stitches, five minutes. Here we go. We're doing it. (coughing) Whoa. Ooh. Okay, Mom. The bad news is, Mom and Dad are gonna take longer than they expected. The good news is, now we have more time for activities. (singsongy): Like more pretending. Should we pretend we have a dog and give it medicine? I've got an activity for you. It's called... (sings fanfare) ...opening the restaurant. Ah. Whoa. The kids are running Bob's Burgers, and this time it's personal! I'm gonna personally run it into the ground! Wait. Why is that personal? Tina, shush. Okay. We finally get to run the restaurant. And we're gonna do it right. Let's see. We can blow that wall out, put the drive-thru there. No! We need 200 chickens. From now on, we only serve poultry! No, we only serve kale. And we should replace our chairs with treadmills. We'll be the healthiest restaurant in town. People will leave hungry. No, no. We want fat people who can't leave our restaurant. No, treadmills. Chicken! Treadmills. Chicken on a treadmill, last offer. Okay. (door bells tinkle) Welcome to McChickies. What can I put in your beak? Uh... I'll have a cheeseburger and fries? Great, and for only two dollars more, you can have your burger chickenized. Ba-kok! No, I don't think I want that. I could offer you a kale-sserole. Or a kale-sadilla. You know what? I forgot to feed the meter. Didn't you just get off a boat? It's the... boat meter. Got to go! Wait. I made a chicken hat. Did you not notice it? Okay, guys, bring it in. Ugh! Why did we ever think a restaurant was a good idea? We've watched Mom and Dad fail at it for years. They make failing look so easy. How do they do it?! But what if there was a restaurant that didn't serve any food and just served up gambling? I thought gambling was illegal. (chuckling): Not if no one sees you do it. No, I think it still is. But not if no one knows about it. I still think maybe we should... We're doing it, Tina! (loud hacking cough) Okay. Sorry. Hey, do you think this is broken? Please, no. Look what I can do with it. I'm feeling light-headed. All right, moving seats! Go, go! (sobbing) (gags) (sneezes) There's nowhere to go. Oh, back to Cough Guy. No, not back there! Oh. (coughing) Welcome back. (retching) (gagging) I can't take it anymore! I got to get out of here! Bob Belcher? That's us! Party of two, coming through! Look at it, guys... our very own underground casino. The Meatgrinder!

Tina, you're in charge of hospitality. Sodas, snacks, pats on the backs. Okay. Gene, you're in charge of the entertainment. (gasps) I've got a great group. They'll be perfect... the Cutie Patooties. The what? It's a girl group I've been putting together. Hey, I found these wigs in the trash. I say we start a girl group! We'll call 'em the Cutie Patooties! Who's in? Oh, we got one! Oh, no, no, no. I'm not interested. I'm just going to the bathroom. Gross. I'll do it. Great! But you're gonna need a stage name. What's your real name? Dottie Minerva. Well, now you're, hmm...

Just serve those drinks, huh? Ow. Hey, how's it going? I'm Dr. Eigerman. Look at that face! So young! I want to breastfeed that face! Thanks. Ah, ah, I think I just need a few stitches. Stitches. Great. Those are no problem for a doctor. Hey! Finger crotch. Why do people keep calling it that? Ah, because your fingers are like the legs and then in the middle, it... Don't do that. Stop. All right, let's stitch you right up, here. Ow! Oh, boy. Look at me, look at me. I'm gonna faint. Look at me. You'll be fine. Ah... He's a doctor.

(Fischoeder clears throat) Sorry to interrupt, Belcher family, but, um, there seems to be a certain unresolved matter of my $5,000. Mr. Fischoeder, you can't expect me to pay you. I mean, they're just kids playing pretend casino. Why can't you play like normal kids? Why can't you bleed like a normal dad? A bet is a bet, Bob. I once lost $30,000 on a horse. She just ran off with it. Listen, I-I can't afford this, Mr. Fischoeder. Well, I'll just raise your rent by a thousand dollars a month for five months. Dad, a word... in private? No. Family meeting, huh? Mom, family meeting? No. Ooh, family meeting. Excuse us a second, Mr. Fischoeder. Certainly. We could play him double or nothing. What? No. We're already in the hole. I'm not gonna owe him $10,000. Dad, I can't beat him, but you can. With that. This... why would I play him with this? My hand's stitched. Plus, I'm not even left-handed. Exactly... if you use that hand, he'll think you can't throw scissors. And that's why you're gonna throw scissors. But I really can't. My fingers won't separate. Yeah, keep saying that. We need him to think you think that. No, Louise, I can't actually do it. Great, so you know what you have to do. Oh, my God. That's my girl. That's my little mind-gamer. My little "Amarosa." But what if Mr. Fischoeder knows that we think that he thinks that Dad can't throw scissors? Or what if he thinks that we know that he thinks that? Or what if he thinks...?

Uh, hello, Belchers... time is money, and I believe it's pay me o'clock. I'm gonna play him. Bobby, are you sure? That's a lot of money. We don't have any other choice, Lin. He's gonna raise the rent... I have to. (groans) Bobby, your finger crotch looks like a '70s porno. Mr. Fischoeder, we have a proposition. Wonderful. You and me... Hmm. Rock, Paper, Scissors, Double or nothing. Oh, I like this. One match for all the beans. If I lose, you owe me nothing. If I win, you pay me $10,000. Double or nothing, that's also my approach to underpants. Shall we dance? All (chanting): Rock, Paper, Scissors. Rock, Paper, Scissors. Rock, Paper, Scissors. One... Rock, Paper, Scissors. two... Rock, Paper, Scissors. three... Rock, Paper, Scissors. sh**t! (Bob yelling) No! (all cheering) Oh, you did it, Bobby! I misread you, Bob. Didn't think could throw scissors with that hand. I thought you were a little bit of a... a wussy. Told you, Dad. I got you out of this. No, you got me into this. And out of it. In, in, in, in, Out, out, out, out, in, in, in. out, out, out. Stop. Out. Well, I guess we're even. Or we run it back... double the double. 20 grand, one throw... let's do this. I'm game. You've got a hot hand, Dad, use it. Yeah, keep the luck going, Meryl Streak. No, no, this is over. No more gambling. So we're not in trouble anymore? Of course you're in trouble. Could you point that in another direction? Sorry. Eh, it's all right. That's... crazy stream of blood. That's a lot of blood... (groans) Pass out if we're not in trouble. You're not in trouble... mmm. Yay! All right, kids, help me get him in the car.

Louise, you be nice. Your Aunt Gayle got you those tickets and she's excited to take you. I'm super excited. I've been practicing my concert scream all week. (weakly): Ah... Ah... Still ne... might need some work. Why would you waste a scream on a stupid boy band? Screams are for roller coasters or axe murderers or Dad's morning breath. Hey, it's not that bad. (screams) Oh, whew! Brush your teeth. I did. Well, then, help me look for my keys. I've told you to stop putting stuff in there if you ever want to see it again. You put my baby brother in there and that was the last we saw of him! Javier Belcher, I love you! I'm serious. We're gonna be late for Gene's table-setting competition. Ugh. Do I really have to? I-I'd rather go to the boy band concert. Bob, one of our kids is actually participating in something. We're going, even if it's table-setting. It's table-scaping. And it's the most exciting competition on four legs. It combines accurate table-setting placement with creative themes and costumes. I'm sure it's much more exciting than it sounds. It has to be. Right? Gene, how did you even end up going to the regionals in table-setting, anyway? It was the only non-athletic after-school activity, and I creamed the competition. As you can see, my tablecloth is a trash bag. Mm-hmm. Please enjoy this gar-beverage. Amusing. And when the meal is over, you can deposit your dirty silverware in the truck to head to the dump. Beep! Beep! (imitates whirring hydraulics) Our theme is twin dinner. Twinner! Two knives. Two forks. Two napkins. Two plates... Congratulations, Gene. You're going to regionals. All right! Mmm. Gene, if you like setting tables so much, why don't you set tables at the restaurant? Or here? (chuckles) No, Dad. I don't set where I eat. Where's Aunt Gayle? It's my first concert. I want to hurry up and start remembering this moment for the rest of my life. Maybe Aunt Gayle realized that she's a 42-yeldaroman and she shouldn't be into boy bands? (phone rings) Hello? (exhales) Hi, Aunt Gayle. Are you outside? An emergency? Emergency? Okay, yeah... I-I understand. Bye. Give me the bad news. Give me the bad news! Aunt Gayle pepper-sprayed one of her cats because she thought he was an intruder trying to sexually assault her. She has to take him to the vet and we have to miss the concert. Yeah! This is the best thing Aunt Gayle's done since she pooped her pants at the cell phone store last year. Ugh, my heart just pooped its pants. (makes farting sound) Wow. Lots of people. I didn't realize that table-setting was such a big deal. 'Scaping! Check out those trophies. Linda: Ooh, and judges with buttons that say "judge." Well, got to get cracking if I'm gonna win first place. You know, honey, it's okay if you don't win. Yeah, Gene, I mean, win or lose, we're just proud that... you're setting a table at the competitive level. Ooh, mini croissants! No matter what I say, stop me when I've had 16. (hums) So, now that we're not going to the concert, what should we do first? (groans) All right, I'll give it a sh*t. (groaning) (Tina groaning) (groans) Is this it? Yeah, that's good. (both groaning) Okay! I hate this. Come on, Tina, cheer up. It's four lame boys who dance. There's so much more out there in the world. No, there isn't! Ugh, it's no fun having you down if I'm not the one who got you there. (sadly): I'm sorry. Fine. I'm not a monster. I'll help you. What do you mean? I mean I'll get you to the concert. I'll get you there. How? Are you sure we can bike all the way there by the time the concert starts? Not if we keep chitchatting like this. Oh, here's the freeway. Once we merge, get in the fast lane, okay? And we'll get there in no time. (moans) What? (moans) (tires squeal) (coughs) Tina: Zeke? What are you doing here? Me and my cousin Leslie are going to sell some bootleg T-shirts and hot dogs at the Boyz 4 Now concert. Boom. Whatcha letcha. Ha! Check it out. One size fits all. Damn, this one says my card's declined, too. Zeke, you have any money? Nah, my white ass is broke. Hey, I've got gas money. You got room for two more in that buggy? You slip me a fiver, I'll be your driver. Leslie loves rhymes. And pasta that comes in cans. If it ain't from a can, it don't go in this man. (laughs) I've never ridden with this many hot dogs before. A day of firsts. Watch out. You squish 'em, you bought 'em. Tina: Boyz 4 Now, here we come. Zeke: Don't squish it! Tina: So who's your favorite Boy 4 Now? Griffin's the hot one. And he's super extreme. His dog is a wolf. Stop. And then there's Allen. He's cute but shy. His fans are called Allen-coholics. Ugh. My stepmom's an Allen-coholic. And a shopaholic. Double trouble! This is Matt. He's moody and a little older. I think, like, 17. Louise: Maybe his mustache is 17, but he's 90. And then there's Boo Boo. He's young but crazy good at dancing. I used to be a real Boo Boo Booster, but now I'm kind of into Griffin. Ugh, stop talking! (mumbling) Stop. Stop. Okay, I'm gonna put my fist in your mouth. (muffled): Okay. Oh, Marilyn. Tragic beauty. (gasps) I love your son's table. Hi. Aw. Thank you. Magic. Hmm. Uh, what's "hmm"? Your table's cute. But only one person can take home the Golden Plate. And we sure didn't come to take home the Silver Spoon. Yeah, well, we ne... neither did we. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah! Oh, please. Come on, Oscar. You've still got a crying Joe DiMaggio to carve out of butter. Bye, guys. Good luck. Don't talk to them! Gene, get back to work on your table. You've got to win. I thought you said it was okay if I didn't win. Well, that was before we met that idiot. Now, chop-chop. Ooh, Dad, you got the fever! 'Scaping fever! Whoo! Can't escape the 'scape! Let's do this! Yeah! (screaming, squealing) Ugh, no wonder no one likes women. All right, see you after the show. Be careful. There's a lot of puberty in there. I can't believe I'm here. It's really happening. I feel light-headed. Whoa! No fainting! I don't think I'm strong enough to go in there alone. I need you to come with me. (sighs) Fine. I'll get you to your seat so you don't get trampled, but then I am out of there. (screaming, squealing) What is wrong with all of you? They're just boys! Boys? Where? (retches) Oh, come on. Woman: Hello, young man. What can you tell me about your table? Oh, well... Wait, what's that behind your ear? Is this your place card? Oh! Oh, my! Now, please, take your seat. Allow me to put your napkin on your lap. Ah...? Very clever. Oh, I seem to have forgotten my centerpiece. Or did I? Eh? And what menu would you serve with this setting? For the entrée, you'll pull a roasted rabbit out of your top hat plate. Served with abracadab-braised potatoes and ice cream shazamwiches for dessert! Oh! She's smiling. I think it's going well. He looks good. He looks loose. I'm pleased to announce our four finalists: Melissa Brown, Oscar Anthony... I did it! I did it! ...Heather Smith and Gene Belcher. Yay! Yay! Wait, why are there four winners? Finalists, please report to your table and begin assembling your second original display. Second display? If you thought our first table was good, which you did... No, we didn't. ...just wait until you see our second one. I don't want to give anything away, but we're about to take a rocket ship out of this world. So it's space-themed? I can't say. Well, it is. You just basically said it. I'll never tell. Plus, I didn't think your first table was good. I graciously disrespect your answer. Well, wait till you see what we got, okay? I'm busy then. Well, you're gonna have to look at it if you're here. (chuckles) I'm double-parked. Okay, finalists. On your mark, get set, set. All right, Gene, what have you got? It better be bigger and more impressive than outer space. Or Marilyn in space. Marilyn in space. I didn't know there was supposed to be a second display. What?! Uh... Did you read the rules, Gene? No! There were 16 pages. I only got up to the part that said no open-toed shoes. What are we gonna do? We can't lose. We've come too far. Come too far? Come too far?! We haven't come too far, Lin! We're just getting started! Okay, so what are we gonna do?! Why am I talking like this?! I don't know! Why am I tal... I think I'm excited! Oh, God! This is weird! We got to win it! Let's win it! (gasps) What? I'm wearing open-toed shoes. Ah, sh**t. Crowd (chanting): Boyz 4 Now! Boyz 4 Now! Boyz 4 Now! Okay, Teen, I think you're all set. Um, I'm gonna get out of here. So, I'll see you later, okay, buddy? Announcer: Good evening, ladies and girls! Are you ready? (cheering and screaming) You know them, you love them! What are they? Crowd: Boyz... 4... Now! (chanting): Boyz 4 Now! Boyz 4 Now! I hope those are the kinds of lasers that slice people in half. Announcer: Please welcome... Allen! (cheering, screaming) (Louise laughing) Holy crap.

Whoa, Louise. You like Boo Boo? What?! No, Tina, that's... Okay, right, like, I like a boy. That's... Ugh! Do you think he might like me? Oh, my God, what's happened to me?! Cut me open!

He's using his shirt money to buy an endangered box turtle from the tour bus driver. Tour bus? But whatever you do, don't feed him after midnight. Just kidding. He doesn't know what time it is. What is he, wearing a watch? Hey, cuz. Look who just joined the family. He lives in a shell and he's cute as hell. Cool. Hey, bus driver, what other endangered animals you got in there? Well, I got an African egg frog. I got a horseshoe bat. Got a skink and a skunk. Got a bush baby... How much you want for that bush baby? Not for sale. Come on. But buy the skink, I'll throw in the skunk. I want Griffin to sign the inside of my eyelids, so he's the last thing I see before I go to bed. What are you going to ask Boo Boo to sign? Oh, no, Tina. I don't want Boo Boo's signature. I told you, I want to slap him. I don't know if he'll like that. That's why it has to be a surprise attack. We need to find some place to burst out of. In there? Uh, great idea, but just in case we aren't six inches tall, how about in... there? Ah, smells horrible in here. Yeah. It would be terrible if these smells got stuck to the inside of my nostrils and I would have to smell this sweaty sweatband forever. (sniffs) I think they're coming. I'll slap Boo Boo in the face, and we'll be on our way. Crush crushed. Whew. Great show, guys. Yeah. We caused a lot of smiles tonight. Totally. Settle in guys. We've got an overnighter.

We could just live in here forever. Bus Driver: All right, Boo Boo. We got to strap you into your booster seat. No! I don't wanna!

We got another one in the hamper. Stopping the bus. Hi. I'm Tina, your new roadie. Do I have something on my face? Just kidding. I know it's five sweatbands. We'll let you off at this rest stop up ahead. Hey, use the phone. Call your parents. They're probably worried about you. I know I'd be worried about my daughter. If I had one. But I'm 17, so I don't. Wait. Before we go, Boo Boo, my sister wants to ask you something. (mumbles) What? (mumbles) What? It sounded like... (mumbles) (mumbles) What? What? What are you saying? What? What? Get me out of this thing! I'm trying to talk to a fan. Give me just a little dignity. (sighs) Thank you. Now, what was that, little girl? (grunting) (groans) Bold. Worth it. I think we nailed it. Yeah. It's daring, it's different. Nobody else is doing this. I'll just put a little more of this strawberry jam from Mom's purse and... done. Ugh. Look at their table. Nerd alert. Am I right? Bob: Yeah. Earth to those guys: You lose. You guys, we didn't give up like we usually do, and I think it really paid off. I'm proud of us. All right, here comes the judge. Good luck, Gene. Go get 'em, Gene Bean. Yeah! Eh? Oh, good Lord. Welcome to my "Menstru-rant." I thought we decided on "Period Piece." Hope you brought your appetite, and your hot flashes. Okay, I think I've seen enough. As you'll see, beside the plate is a sanitary napkin. May I place it on your lap in case there's a big spill? No. I... Please, let me. Get away. It's got wings. Show her the tampon straw. Judge: No. I don't want to see the tampon straw. Someone's on the rag. Well, at least those two got creamed, too. (crying): Oh, God... Dad, do I have to do this again? Yes. Them losing is like us winning. Yeah, and we got fourth place. I mean, I don't think any of our kids have gotten fourth place in anything. I'm number four! I'm number four! Ooh, I got an idea for next year. Baby Jessica stuck in a well. Yes! You have to look for your dinner for two days as the nation watches. Tina: Thanks for coming to get us, Aunt Gayle. It was the least I could do. The good news is my cat is going to be fine. He just has to wear goggles from now on in case it happens again. (meows) Tina, if that's what your life is like, God, how are you even alive? What do you mean? You have a crush on almost every boy you know. How do you do it? Feeling that way for three hours was way too much for me. I'm no hero. I put my bra on one boob at a time like everyone else. Well, the good news is that now that I got it out of my system, I'm done having crushes forever. I hope for your sake you're right. But if not, you know where I live. You're a strong woman, Tina. I know. Good night, Tina. Night, Mom. Night, Louise. Did you guys have fun today? Pretty dull. Aw. (makes kissing sounds) Ugh. Disgusting. I hate you so freaking much, you idiot.

You look adorable. Ah, all ready for your big field trip to the museum. You happy now? Very... thank you for volunteering to volunteer. Yeah, so we're even. Well, I've been a parent volunteer for eight years, and this is the first time you're doing it, but, yeah, fine, we're even. (laughs) Great... so, how did you survive eight years of being stuck with Mr. Frond? Wine Thermos. Hmm. Get a cyanide Thermos since you're gonna want to k*ll yourself because field trips are dumb! I agree... field trips are dumb. I remember being a kid, going to the zoo, and sneaking off with Warren Fitzgerald. We smoked cigarettes in front of the zebras. Half-smoked. I didn't really smoke. Start your story over... I just got here. Aw, you didn't care about seeing the animals? It was a pretty crappy zoo. Yeah, it's a pretty crappy museum, too. And we go there every year. I like it. Me, too. The Sands from Exotic Lands exhibit is my favorite. Last year when I got home, there was sand in my crack. It was hands-on learning for my butt. I bet we all have a good Sands from Exotic Lands story. (groans) I'm already bored. Hey, sometimes good things come from boredom. Like Gene. Thank you. And Tina. Pow. Okay, people, take a look at my buddy board and find your randomly assigned buddy. (both screaming) Okay, oh, uh, wait, wait. Hey, hey. Oh, look, Andy and Ollie got assigned to each other. What are the odds? Yay! Yay! And I got... Me. (laughs) I got a Genie in a bottle. Hey, if I rub you, will you give me a wish? No. Hey, I heard you can see boobies from all around the world in this museum if you know where to look. We're going on a booby bender. Boobity-boobity-a-la-la-la. (giggling) (makes fart sound) This I could get used to. Deedlup. Rudolph Steiblitz? Wait, is that Regular-Sized Rudy or Pocket-Sized Rudy? Regular-Sized Rudy. Oh, thank God. POCKET-SIZED RUDY: Hey, what's the big idea? Geez, Rudy, quit sneaking up on people. Wear a bell. God, I have Henry Haber... the school weirdo. Great, I have Tina Belcher. The dorkiest girl in the school. (both groan) You know what? Maybe I'll show him how to be cooler. People used to think I was a weirdo, too. You know what? Maybe she just needs someone to show her how to be cool. People used to say I was a dork, too. Both: This'll be fun. Teddy: So, where's Bob today? On a field trip with the kids. At the museum. I guilted him into going. You miss him, huh? The thing is, he's still here. Don't you see? He's me. He's you, he's that spatula. Aw. Sure, it's a crappy restaurant and people walk right by it, never take notice. Wait, what? The floor's always sticky. Sticky? But it's home for a lot of folks. I'm getting choked up here. Okay... the thing is, now that I made Bob go, I feel like those kids don't need me anymore. Now he gets to play mama bird. Singing the songs on the bus... Linda. Holding hands... Linda, what are you doing here? What? What? Go to them! Oh, oh! Go to the museum. Be with your babies, go to them! I got to go, I got to go! We'll be fine. I'm waiting on... on fries. Lock the door, Linda! Get out! Why are we going? Lock the door. Go! Never look back, never look back! What you drawing there, Henry? I'm designing robot characters for my next graphic novel. It's part of a series. It's important to have interests, but maybe you can find one a little less dorky? Uh, it's actually pretty cool. Maybe you just don't understand it? Oh, I understand it. There's 17 installments, and you really need to read them in order, which you haven't, so I doubt it. Both: This is going to be harder than I thought. Tina: Robots? But that does give me an idea for my next erotic fan fiction: Ro-butts. (metal clanging) Hey, what's that noise? My cymbals... you never know when somebody's gonna want to jam. Hmm, back me up with those, would you? Well, okay, but I haven't... Hey, Mr. Frond. Why did the chicken cross the road? I don't know, Louise, why? So he would be in a different school district where there's a different guidance counselor. Hiya! Yeah! Louise. What? Don't say that here. That's fine... I'm out of material. Ooh, is there a rat exhibit? I think those are picketers. Picketers? Even the people who get paid to go in there don't want to be in there! That's how terrible it is! It's a good thing your mom isn't here. Why, Mom likes protesting? What? No, she loves chanting. Oh, who doesn't? Yah, tah, yah-tah-tah! Hi, Madeline Greenberg, museum director. Phillip Frond, counselor of children, friend of the museum. I'm Bob, I, uh... He's merely a volunteer. Oh. Well, you may have noticed, we're having a little trouble with the UFMWD? I've had problems with that. Drink some cranberry juice. Hmm, no, it's the United Federation of Museum Workers and Docents. They're on strike. Oh, like how my stepmom's on a s*x strike till my dad fixes the VCR. Exactly, it hasn't affected much. We still have all the exhibits, all the fun, just one-eighth of the staff. (laughs) Louise: An Amazon exhibit? Maybe this day won't suck so bad after all. Oh, that's not open. What?! No! The strike slowed us down there a little. (mumbles) Henry and Tina: Whoa. Nice plesiosaur. Nice horses. What'd you say? Plesiosaur. The coolest dinosaur. Hmm... Henry, it's great that you have a favorite animal, but what about picking a cooler animal? Like a horse or miniature horse? Uh... It's your first time as a parent volunteer, Bob. Linda's set the bar pretty high. I hope you're up to it. With great vest comes great responsibility. Ugh. Okay, kids, stick with your buddy and stay with the group! You don't want to be a Missing Marvin or a Walk-Away Wendy! Ugh... huh? Okay, Regular-Sized Rudy, change of plans. I'm going in there, and you're coming with me. Yeah, I don't think we're allowed to do that... Oh, we're not. Oh. We're going where no Wagstaff student has ever gone: The Amazon! Rudy, just keep your voice down. Oh... Amazon? Yes, ma'am-azon! Ha! Shush! Shush! (whispering): Sorry. Yes, ma'am-azon. I'm glad you're up for this, Rudy. I thought I was gonna have to get a buddy-ectomy. Are you kidding? This is great. I've never done anything like this. My mom barely let me go on this field trip. (clanging) Ugh! Okay, I know you're new here, but this isn't how sneaking works. You have to ditch the backpack. Yeah, sure. No! (cymbals crash) I didn't mean throw it. That was loud. Okay, I'll show you the ropes, and then we're gonna go under the ropes and touch all the stuff. Yeah. ♪ I need to blow my nose. Uh, okay. I can only blow it if you hold it. Ugh. (moaning) (grunts) Now me. Oh, my God. (blows nose) Bob? Time for a head count. Uh... oh. Four, eight, ten, (nose blowing continues) 14, 16... I'm gonna push you now, Ollie. I'm gonna push you away now. I understand. Uh, uh, okay, who's missing? Oh, man. Louise. Figures. A-Are we good? Uh, uh-huh. Yeah. Definitely. I just got to go over here for a second. Be right back! Of course she's in there. Louise. Louise. (animal noises) Louise, come out of the plants. (high voice): Who's Louise? I'm just a talking plant. My name is Leafy Greenbrier. Rudy: And I am Kate Bush. Listen, both of you. I know you're not excited about this museum, but I can't have you kids being Missing Marvins or whatever that stupid thing Frond said. Walk-Away Wendys. Thank you. Uh-huh. Um, what's your name? Regular-Sized Rudy. Regular-Sized Rudy? Why do they call you that? Just look at me. Um, okay. Listen, you two are supposed to stay with the group. Ugh. Dad, when I hear "stay with the group," I leave the group. Yeah, Louise, that can be annoying. All right, which way did we come in? Uh, come on, this way. No, you come on. Dad, look around. We're in the jungle. Ah! Can we just for a second walk around a little? Hmm. It is kind of impressive. Yeah. But we both know I have to take you guys back. You remind me of my mom. She hates fun, too. (whistling) Hide. Get down. Hey! Who's over there? Shh-shh-shush. Somebody over there? Everybody shut up. Hello? Come on, Jeff, you know I hate plants. Oh, they're gonna drop their juice boxes when they see me. (indistinct shouting) Museum management is unfair and anti-union. Yeah, I hear that, buddy. No, no, we're protesting. What do we want? Others: Fairness. Woman: When do we want it? Others: Now. Oof. What? The chant? Well, uh... It's the chant, isn't it? Yeah. You got to wow 'em. Something like, uh... Give us more money, damn it! Or we'll shave the woolly mammoth! Give us longer breaks for snacks or we'll burn the artifacts! You're really good at this. Thank you. All right, good luck, got to go. No, wait. We need you. Hmm? Remember, kids, smiling is the new touching. Nice. Also, if you ignore history, you're doomed to repeat it, and if you touch history, you will be suspended for six days. Yes... and when you get to the pioneer exhibit, learn but don't churn. Who are you? Is there a, uh... Mr. Museum? No, there is not. Okay, booby checklist. Let's see what we got. Did you get that at the gift shop? Nope, it's my cousin's. He wrote down where to find all the boobs in the museum. Viking boobies, yeah! Eskimo boobies, coming real soon. It's an embarrassment of boobies. (Zeke and Jimmy chuckle) Good one, Zeke. That's Jimmy Jr. You may not know him because he's one of the cooler kids in school. Hi, Jimmy Jr. Hi, Tina. (laughs, snorts) I know Jimmy Jr. Hey, Jimmy J. Hey, Harvey. Hen-Henry. He's always joking like... uh, not even my name, uh... (plants rustle) Okay, I think the coast is clear. Let's get back to the group. But we just hid from the guard. We're having fun here, ah? Come on, let's go into the stilt hut just so we can say we did it, and then we can go back to the boring group and that no-fun Frond and have a crappy day just like you want. Please. Louise: It's literally a hut on stilts. (sighs) Fine. Stilt hut and then that's it. Stilt hut! 

  Stilt hut! Shh. Stilt hut! Shh-shh-shush. Rudy... rookie. I know. (whispering): Now we're all whispering. So nothing for you to check off here, Zeke. They all have hair covering their boobs. Like a stupid fashion magazine, right? But not so fast. And three... two... ta-ta time. No nip, though. Wow. Your cousin's really into this. I never heard of anyone having a boob fetish. Well, this isn't even remotely realistic. I mean, the stegosaurus... Henry. What did I say about dinosaurs? Why are you talking that way? I'm just trying to help you, Henry, okay, buddy? And I'm just trying to help you, buddy. All I'm saying is, the stegosaurus... it's obviously... Uh-uh, honey. Huh? No. What a dork. Both: I know. Whoa, whoa. You think I'm the dork? Of course. Everyone does. No, no, no, no, you're the dork. Huh. Well, there's only one way to solve this. Well, there's probably, like, a lot of different ways. But why don't we try your dorky way? Yeah, well, 'cause it's not the dorky way. Can you just, it... drop the dork and just talk to me? (sighs) You look so dorky right now. Linda: Make our paycheck more colossal! Picketers: Or we'll poop on all the fossils! Yes. Rude. Well, great stilt hut. Yeah. The best. Now, let's go back. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. The stilt hut was my fun jungle idea. Now... what's, what-what's one from you? What do you got? Um, go back. Don't say "go back." Warren Fitzgerald wouldn't say go back. Warren Fitzgerald would say you've gone soft. Warren Fitzgerald? From my zebra story? Yeah. From your fun past. I've got ideas, but... I don't believe you have ideas unless you say them out loud. Yes, of course I have ideas. If I look around, I could come up with something. Okay, well, then look around and come up with something. Okay, there. We're gonna go right there. (Louise chuckling) Look who's stepping up. But, uh, how are we gonna get up there? We could fly. I know we can't fly. We could just do this. Huh? Who's soft now, Louise? Your stomach, your butt, and your thighs. But nice work. Let's go! (Rudy and Bob grunting) (humming) Mr. Softie just pushed over a tree. I like it. Hey, shake a leg, Reg Size. (panting): I'll be right there. And Mom said I'd never climb a tree. All right, race you to the top. Let's do it! First one up gets to spit down on the other. Don't worry, Rudy, we're not gonna spit on you. (chuckles) As long as I'm included. Ooh, ooh. Look! Camel boobies. Those are humps. One man's hump... Okay, students, buddy up. In a few moments we'll proceed to the hands-on room of the museum. Oh, finally! Yay! Sands from Exotic Lands! Sand? Really? That's what floats your scrote? And then some. Mmm, the hands-on room. It's the one place you're allowed to touch. (shudders) Your skin should be its own exhibit. Well, your hair should be sent to an Asian wig factory. Oh. Who's a bigger dork, Henry Haber or me? You. Henry. Not helpful. Bigger dork, me or Henry? Tina. Henry. Well, looks like we're dork-locked. (sighs) We need fresh eyes. Hello, I'm Tina and this is Henry. I'm Henry. (sighs) Yeah. Who do you think is the bigger dork? Um, I don't think you kids should play this game. Labels lead to hurt feelings. Sheesh. Never ask a dork to judge a dork contest. Yeah. (pants) Come on. Pick up the pace, softie. Softie? That's funny coming from the girl who called me Daddy until she was eight. What? That's crazy. You better have a good lawyer, 'cause that is slander, sir. (wheezing) That's me laughing. (wheezing laugh) Time to kick it up a notch, okay? Boom, chaka, boom, chaka, boom, boom, boom! Others: Boom, chaka, boom, chaka, boom, boom, boom! Weeda, weeda, weina, weina, weina, wang. Others: Weeda, weeda, weina, weina, weina, wang. Shake your hips! Wiggle your butt! Drop your pants and pick 'em back up! No. I don't want to drop my pants. Why? (pants) Ha! We did it! You know what? I am gonna spit. (hocks loogie, spits) Hey, I'm glad we ditched. That was fun. Me, too. Let's do it again sometime. Like, maybe when you're old and senile, I'll close the restaurant and come spring you from the nursing home. What? Sorry, I didn't want to do it, but Gene and Tina put you in a nursing home. And not one of the nice ones either. No, you said you'd be running the restaurant. Oh, no, I was just saying... You're taking over the family business? (scoffs) Yeah, right. Ha! Admit it, you look up to me. No! S... (groans) You are ruining our perfect day right now! Oh, my God, am I your hero? (groans) Sick! (wheezing) Fun... hurts... my lungs. Wow. I thought I was out of shape. Man: What the... Oh! Shh, shh, shh. This doesn't go here. (grunts) Disgusting tree. Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew! Whoa. That's gonna make getting down a lot harder. Oh, crap, crap, crap. We're stuck up here. This was a stupid idea. (wheezing) Um, Rudy, are you okay? Haven't gone this long (wheeze) without my inhaler. Inhaler? I'm supposed to use it every two hours (wheeze) or I could die. What? (wheezing): But I'm sick of that thing. O-Okay. Where's your inhaler? In... my... backpack. Where's your backpack? Um, I made him ditch it. What? But don't worry about me. (inhales deeply) I'm loving every minute of this. Oh, my God. Wait! Security guy! Come back! Help! Help! Louise: Why didn't you tell me you need your inhaler? I'm your buddy. We're supposed to talk. We talk. This is why you can't just do whatever you want, Louise, there are consequences. You shouldn't have left the group. And I shouldn't have let you talk me into doing this! So it's your fault? No! Right now we just have to get Rudy his inhaler! (wheezing) How are we gonna get down? That tree was our ladder. I know that tree was our ladder! I put it there! (weakly): I think I'm coming around. (wheeze) I think I'm getting better. Nope! Getting worse. (gurgling): Getting worse. Oh. Oh, boy. Uh, CPR. I know how to give CPR. No, thank you. Uh, wh-why don't I just try it? And if you hate it, I'll stop. No! Yeah, okay, you're right. Just hold on. I have an idea. What? Wish me luck. Wh-What are you doing? Maybe the bravest and dumbest thing I've ever done. This is for you, Warren Fitzgerald! And you, too, Rudy. Cool. Whoa! (Louise shouting) (screams) Dad! (grunts) Whoa! That was amazing! Hello, sand. You remember these hands? (moans) We're finally done with boobs! Oh, Gene, you're never done with boobs. They're everywhere you look! Mountains, speed bumps... Hell, you just made a nice pair yourself, Cool Breeze. (shouts) You've ruined sand! Tina: Darn it. We still haven't settled this. I don't get it. Why would anyone think I'm a dork? Well, what makes me a dork? Well, um, you're a dork for plesiosaurs. And your comic book. Graphic novel. But, yes, I also dabble in comic books, action figures, and stickers. Yeah. See? Well, you're a dork for horses. Huh, I am. Among other things. Hmm. I guess we're both dorks in our own way. Everyone! I have an announcement. You're probably all wondering how the voting came out in the Tina/Henry dork controversy. Others: No. Well, the verdict is in. I'm a dork. For boys and horses and zombies. And I'm a dork for dinosaurs and my series of graphic novels. I guess I'm a dork for dancing. (grunting) Okay, then I'm a dork for sand. Guess that makes me a dork for boobs. I'm a dork for Ollie. I'm a dork for Andy! And I'm a dork for bargain Chardonnays (quietly): And being asked out by handsome guidance counselors. What about you, Mr. Frond? I'm a dork for getting on the bus on time. Get your buddies and let's go! (quietly): Call me. Oh! If my mother answers, hang up. Oh. We might be dorks for different things, but at our cores, we're all... the same. I made a very good point. Let's all go now. Boys are from Mars, girls are from Venus. I've got a yum-yum, you've got a pen1s. Uh, Linda? What? Ow. What? Uh, we've been talking, and we want you to leave. Wha... (gasps) Really! You want me to leave? Yeah. Well, chant for it. Oh, wait. I'm sorry. That's right. You can't chant! Ha! (wheezing) How many pumps? L-Let me read the instructions. Oh, what, you're worried he's gonna breathe too well? Come on! Fine! (inhales deeply, sighs) Thank you. (groans) Buddy. Oh, I hate you. But I love air. So I guess we're stuck together. Let me get a puff of that. Man: Hey! You're not allowed to be in here. What's going on?! Uh, we're, uh... Run! Man: What do we want? Others: Linda gone! When do we want it? Others: Now! Linda Belcher's here to stay! I don't work here anyway! Boo! Oh, my face! (jeering) Louise: Scabs! Scabs are coming! Let's get 'em! They'll do anything for a dollar! (panting): Did you come to surprise us, but then you got caught up in the chanting? Yep. Did Louise get you in trouble with security? Yep. See you at home? Yep. Uh-oh. I'm missing two. Here they are. Two here. (wheezes) Oh. Regular-Sized Rudy, I detect a bit of wheeze. He needs an inhaler every two hours or he'll die. Yeah. I-I heard about that. Oh, uh, here's your vest. (screams) What did you do to it?! It was like this when I got it. Gene! Tina! How was your day? Dorky. Booby. Great, great, glad you had fun. (quietly): I think we're in the clear. Yeah, we got away with it. That's not what you should be taking away from this. Did we get away with it, Rude? Perfect crime. Mmm. I've tasted life, and I'm hungry for more. You do realize you almost made Rudy die. Almost dying is the best part of living. It's called almost-live-dying. (chuckles) So, when you run the restaurant, will you call it Louise's Burgers? I don't know. Maybe. Daddy. ♪ Boom, chaka, boom, chaka, boom, boom, boom ♪

my recreation league angel, Gene Belcher! They're baseball pants. Well, they go great with this top. It's also called a jersey, Gene. No. Ease up, everybody, back off. It's his first game. Oh! This is so exciting! I'll show you exciting. Hi-ya! I've got armor for my ding-dong! Come on. That's not how you hit a crotch with a baseball bat. This is how you hit a crotch with a baseball bat. (grunts) Ha-ha-ha! What doesn't break my testicles only makes them stronger! Wow, Gene is really athletic. I love baseball: The pizza parties, the spiky shoes, the parade at the end of the season where we ride on a float. How's my wave? Hi... Hi... Hey, Teddy, do you want an espresso before we close up? A what? An espresso. Huh? Whoa, look at that. Yeah, it was a little pricey, but it's an investment, right? Someone comes in for a burger, they'll say, "Oh, Bob, finally you're selling espresso." Oh, Bobby, it's like that hot plate you bought. You had big dreams for that. Where is it now? It's right there. Oh. Ow, it's hot. Teddy, why don't you try one? It's on the house. Nah. Well, just to see if you like it. I don't wanna, Bob. I'm declining politely. Just take one sh*t, Teddy! I don't like those tiny cups! Just drink one! They make it look like I have giant hands! Come on! Leave me alone! Oh, fine. Really? You're gonna give up that easy? Well, if no one's gonna drink this, maybe I'll just... Ugh, that's terrible. That's... that's... Ooh... Ah... Ooh... Ooh, ah... Oh... ooh... Hey, Tina. Hi, Teddy. Hi. Uh... Huh. Gross, right? Yeah, it's an acquired taste... that I just acquired. Hey, batter, batter, batter, hey, batter, batter, batter, hey, batter, batter, batter, batter, batter, batter, hey, hey, hey, hey! Umpire: Strike three! You're out. Ha-ha! I made that kid strike out. I did that! I'm part of this! Which one's yours? Oh, he's down there in the dugout entertaining the troops. Normal Gene. Evil Gene. Normal Gene. Evil Gene. (grunts) I think I can hear my hair growing, especially the bangs. Hey, maybe that's why they call them bangs. Hey, keep it down. How many espressos have you had? Just one. I'm being really interesting right now, I can tell. Usually my personality is a little flat. Did you ever pick up on that? That you have a personality? No. How we doing, Coach? Have you played all your kids? Uh, yeah, I think I got 'em all. Pretty much. Yeah, I got 'em all. Yeah, I think, I think so, yeah. What about Belly Bongo? Come on. I played my girl. I'm a boy. You got to play Belly Bongo, Coach. (sighs) All right, Gene, you're in. What about urine? Grab a bat. Done. Now what? Sometimes with Jimmy Jr., I don't know what to say. But now I don't know what not to say. I have all these thoughts, and it's like, "Okay, guys, who can get to my mouth first?" I think I love Espresso Tina. Thanks. I think Jimmy Jr. will, too. Oh, Gene's going up to bat! Yay! Go, Gene, go! Whoo! Why does he have to play now? The game's tied. Gene doesn't even thrive under no pressure. Okay, just roll it at me as slowly as you feel like. Oh, God. Aah! Strike one, strike two, strike three! I surrender! He's a, a little tentative out there. He kind of got a piece of it, right? Not really. No, no, he didn't. (screams) (bat smacks) (grunts) Ow! (panting) It's not your fault you lost, sweetie. It's his fault. Hey! Button it, you seventh inning bi... Oh, Gene, oh, you played! Wasn't it fun? I hate baseball! I hate it! (grunting) Gene, wait! (grunts) Oh, nice slide, honey! Linda: It's not that bad, Gene. You made some errors, you struck out, one or two people booed. Louise. To be fair, I also laughed. That's it! I'll never set foot on a baseball field again except as a streaker! I quit! If you quit, you'd be a quitter. That's worse than being a loser. Well, let's not dismiss the quitting idea. Bob! What? It has a quiet dignity to it. Quiet dignity? Have you met us?! Uh, Bob, what's the Burger of the Day? I'm looking at an empty chalkboard here. Well, it's something with gouda cheese. I'm still trying to come up with a name for it. Woulda Coulda Gouda. You Gouda Be Kidding Me. As Gouda As it Gets. Gouda Gouda Gumdrops. A Few Gouda Men. Gouda Gouda Two Shoes... comes with shoes. Gouda Day, Sir. Uh, Tina, no more espresso for you. There goes Jimmy Jr. Hey, Jimmy Jr., I see you're riding a bicycle. Do you know they call it a bicycle because "bi" means two? Speaking of two, there's two of us. Do you want to go on a date, by the way? Uh, okay. What's good for you? How about tomorrow at 5:00 a.m.? I know I'll be up. Uh... Great. So it's a date. I'll see you then. We'll get coffee. Oops, wrong way. Eh... We're gonna turn this sinking ship around. You just need a little extra coaching. Right, Bob? Bob? Huh? Coaching. A little extra coaching. In? Baseball! From? You! Oh! Right. For Gene. Sure. Yes, you. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Ah... I probably should have been playing catch with you for years. Then you'd be good at it. It's so beautiful here. Dad, is this Heaven? It's not Heaven, but the, but the lighting is nice, right? It's a nice time of day. You know, when I saw you playing the game, it looked to me like you were a little afraid of the ball. The stitches remind me of Frankenstein! All right, I'm gonna toss it to you easy, Gene, okay? It's getting hard to see, so let me know when you throw it. Uh-oh. Oh! You hit me in the nose! I'm sorry! I said I was gonna throw it. (groans) Here, you can have a free throw at me. Ow! I thought you couldn't throw! I was aiming at your feet! Ow! Stop it, Gene! That time I aimed at your face! All right, how about this? (grunts) (both grunting) Aah! Don't throw that! Do not throw that! Hey, look at this. I Yahoogled "boy needs baseball help, father-son fail unathletic hopeless turquoise jewelry." Why turquoise jewelry? 'Cause I've been looking for some. It's coming back. Anyway, look what came up. "The Deuce of Diamonds' Diamonds in the Rough in the Diamond Baseball Camp." It's rated four diamonds! Hello there, ballers. I'm the Deuce of Diamonds! Hey, I know him. He used to be the Prince of Persuasia. The Prince of whosia? A teacher of the ancient art of seduction. Dr. Yap had his video. I learned so much. But now I have something better, a magic black bean. A what? Nothing. What's holding you back from maximum baseball excellence? Guess what was standing in my way. I was. Wow, that's deep. Deeply dumb. Shh! I was striking myself out. Then I unlocked the baseball awesomeness inside my body. Now look at me. He didn't do that. Check out these incredible results from my one-day Diamonds in the Rough in the Diamond Baseball Camp. Now he's Deucing it. Now they're all Deucing it. Ooh, look at this. The Deuce is holding his camp in town tomorrow! And it's only $495. $495 for that? That's crazy. For that kind of money, he should throw in $495. Don't be a cheapskate, Bob. Do you love Gene or not? Of course I love Gene. Ew! Then we're spending $495. We don't have it! Oh, go fart in a fortune cookie. No fair! I can't have $495, but Tina can have all the glasses she wants?! Ugh! Let's discuss this over a frothy espresso. I'll go make it. No more espresso, Tina. I'm gonna lock her in her room. Tina: No. Ah, maybe I could sell something valuable. I got a Spanish edition of Fifty Shades of Grey I found on a bus. Cincuenta Sombras de Grey. Don't tell your father. You could sell your soul. I did, and look at me, I'm fine. (gasps) I have something more precious than my soul. Linda: And this one and this one. Good-bye. Ooh, and this one. Okay. Bye-bye. Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, okay. And this one. Oh, no-no-no, not that one. Not that. I don't know how that got in there. Okay. Wait, wait. A couple more. Bye. Go. Okay. Look, I need $495. Plus that derringer. Look, the kitsch craze is kind of played out. No one likes babies. What? Who doesn't? What? I got a shelf of 'em. Oh! Look at that one! Let me see that one! (clears throat) Uh, Mom. What? Oh. Going in the wrong direction. I'm sorry. Maybe if you had some fine art or antique coins or firearms. Or high-end restaurant equipment? Talk to me. What about the...? (gasps) Ah... (grunts) Stealing and pawning. I feel so dirty! I told you you'd like crime, Mom. Eh... yeah, I do. Wounder why dad changes his mind about me going to the Deuce of Diamonds' Baseball Camp? Well, because he loves you. But you don't let him know that you know, all right? He doesn't like to talk about his feelings. He's all stunted inside like a big dumb man, all right? It's our little secret, okay? Just like our Sunday mani-pedis. Oh, look, there he is! Hi, The Deuce. This is Gene. I've got the heart of a baseball player but the body of a manager. Office manager. No problem, that's what we're here for. Baseball is all I do. The Closer of Close-Up Magic. Don't worry about that. The lceman of lnkjet Printer Repair? Those are just... in my trunk. Now, about the tuition... Ah! It wasn't easy, but I got it all. Great, cash! I mean, checks are so formal. It's a lot of money. But you guarantee results, right, Deuce? You better write your name on this little guy because you're not gonna recognize him when you pick him up. Ha-ha! I'm gonna have a k*ller fastball and a magnificent perm. Whoo! I'm gonna have a hot dog. Hey-hey-hey, Jimmy Pesto! Hi, Linda. Thanks for the heads up about the baseball camp. Isn't it great? Last chance to earn my love, guys. (laughs) I love that joke. Okay, guys, let's get started. I'm gonna count these checks, and you guys are gonna inject yourself with some performance-enhancing enthusiasm! All: Yay! I am going to be athletic. How you doing, Tina? You seem a little logy. Well, you seem a little shut your face. Whoa. Tina! It's her first day since I cut her off espresso, so... Yeah, when you dance with the bear, you can't stop until the bear wants to stop. Espresso's the bear. Come on, Dad. Just let me bite down on a bean! No! No espresso! You can't have any and your father can't sell any. And, uh, I mean, he's allowed to, he just never, ever will. So end of subject. Uh, ooh, look at the sky. You know what? I've been thinking about it. Maybe I should try it. Broaden my horizons. No, don't! I-I saw a report. It'll shrink your pen1s. Yeah, it'll shrink it. One study says it'll shrink, the other says it'll grow. You got to just live your life. Set me up, Bob. My first sale. (Linda groans) We never thought he'd actually sell one. I just got to take off the dust cover. Take off that dust cover. (Bob and Tina screaming) Where is it?! Oh, my God, it's gone. Oh, how odd. Okay, guys, listen up. Your glove is your best friend. But you are not its best friend. You're its boss and you are pissed off. Now punish your glove. Pound it. Make it afraid to miss a ball ever. (grunting) You've got to start meeting your performance goals! When you change your attitude, you change your batitude. So swing away. Uh, Mr. The Deuce, you don't have a baseball. If we played with a real ball, we'd spend half the day running after it. It's all in your mind. Whoa. Wow. (whooshing) (hitting noise) That's a double in the gap. (chuckles) 

  (whooshing) (hitting noise) Home run. Ooh! (hitting noise) Broken bat, single. (gasps) I'll need a pinch runner. What's that, kid? (wheezing): I said I'm gonna need a pinch runner. Speak up, please. (wheezing) (whooshing) (hitting noise) Long fly ball. This could go. Oh, no, caught at the wall. No! By you. You hit it, you caught it. Amazing over-the-shoulder catch. I was robbed. By me. An espresso machine doesn't just walk away. Where are you, you big, beautiful silver b*st*rd? Who would do this? (door chimes ring) Hi, Tina. What, what, what?! I just... I was saying hi. 'Cause I just walked in, so... what do you mean, what? Oh, my God, I never noticed how annoying you are. I can't even understand what you're saying. Oh, I have a speech impediment, Tina. Well, fix it. Hey, where's Gene? Ah, Gene, Gene, Gene. That's all you ever talk about. What about me? Look at me. Gene's at that baseball thing. My brothers are there, too. What?! Oh, that's right. Uh, Gene's at, uh... (mumbling): Deuce of Diamonds' Baseball Camp. Playing baseball. (panting) Okay, cross home. Tip your cap. Chest bump the guy on deck, and that's a home run ot. Okay, any questions so far? About anything at all. Girls, boys, life, money, inkjet printer repair. Um, can I be a good baseball player... (wheezing): ...with asthma? Rudy, I'm gonna tell you a story. A famous baseball player... whose name I can't remember right now... had Lou Gehrig's Disease and he didn't let it slow him down. That was inspiring. Um, can Ollie and I be umpires? Yes, you can. You're out of there! You're out of there! You're out of there! You're out of there! The Deuce, will I ever get over being scared of the ball? Gene, listen to me. You are so much bigger and rounder than that ball, it should be scared of you. (high voice): Oh, no, it's Gene. I won't hurt you, baseball. That's okay. It's your job to hit me over the fence. I love you so much, Gene. Aw. (phone rings) Hold on, getting a call. Ugh, Mr. You Owe Me $1,100 Manoogian. That is a long first name and a long last name. Hey, Mr. Manoogian. Well, I've been trying to reach you, too. Uh-huh, I see. Yes, sir. Okay. Well, I could pay the bill now, so you can go ahead and not put my stuff out on the street. I'm sorry, it's how much? Minibar? That's where they get you. All right, well, you know what? Then I'm coming down there. And I'm bringing some of my people. Okay, guys, listen up. Um, sometimes in baseball you go on a road trip. So let's practice piling into the team bus over there. Now, everybody grab a bat. Bob: Linda, look at me. How did you pay for baseball camp? Uh... I, uh, I sold my porcelain babies. Wait, I saw those when I was tearing the place apart. So you didn't sell them! Those are my backup babies. Yeah, that's the B-team. Look how ugly they are. You can do this the easy way or the hard way. (porcelain shatters) Tina! Do you think I'm playing here? (exclaims) I need that espresso machine back... oh, my head. (giggling) Hi, Tina, I think you're more into espresso than you are into me. (screams) It's true. I love espresso, coffee, caffeinated teas, and then Jimmy Jr. In that order. All right, I did it. I sold the espresso machine. (sighs) That machine was the crown jewel of this restaurant, Linda. It was made in Turin, Italy. That's where they make... Fiats! Big whoop. It was a waste of money. I'd rather waste money on Gene. You don't even know if this Deuce is legit. He has a Web site. Yeah, they don't just give those out. We're going down there and we're coming back with our money. Or a really good baseball player. I hope neither of you are getting your hopes up. Tina, break another one. That one. Oh, no. The Deuce: Okay, we're here. Everybody out. Hey, this is where our dad goes for his naps. Hi, Mr. Manoogian! Oh, crap. Hey, hey, hey, hey! No, no, no, too late! Listen. Come on! You're too late! Come on, man. Not cool! You're not cool! Now, listen. I don't have the whole $1,100 in cash. (groans): Oh... But I can sign over some checks. Now, this one has a flag on it, and patriotic checks never bounce. No, no, no, I don't need your stupid flag checks, okay?! Pay me now, or I'm keeping your DVD player. It's not a DVD player, it's a Blu-ray player that also plays DVDs! Well, then, that makes it a DVD player! No, it doesn't! Hey, how much for this hot pot? This is not a yard sale. Three dollars. Okay, it is a yard sale. Linda: Well, they were here. Bob: Oh, that's great, so this guy... The Deuce... just takes off somewhere with all the kids? Look, he left that gym bag. See, we've got bath towels from the Sand Flea motel and some crumbled deodorant in a baggy. See, that's valuable. He's got to come back for that. Oh, my God, Lin, I don't want to sit around waiting for him. Let's go to the Sand Flea. Yeah, we shouldn't even stop for coffee. But let's stop for coffee. Manoogian: Okay, this isn't enough. You're still way short. Sorry I couldn't move the tube socks. Okay, fine! If that's how you want to play it, we're just gonna take some swings... at your soda machine. Go to it, guys. But isn't that vandalism? Babe Ruth used to beat the crap out of a root beer machine. Now look at him. Okay. (grunting) Yeah, there you go. Four-bagger. Grand salami. That's a good looking foul ball right there. Soda, you made me fat, but you also made me strong! Maid cart, get it. I'll come back later. These boys are very weak. I see no damage. They're damaging your pride. Not very much. Bob: Oh, my God, there's Gene. Gene, what are you doing? Playing baseball, and I'm great. (grunts) Look at his swing, Bobby. Poetry in motion. Yeah, slow motion. Some soda's leaking out. It might have caffeine in it. Bob: Tina, don't lick that. Do you folks mind? These practices are closed to parents. Just give us our money back and we'll go. Refund, no. That's not gonna happen. Yeah, that's not gonna happen. Guys, I did everything The Deuce told me to and now I'm excellent at baseball. Gene, this is a scam. Excuse me, The Deuce has ears and feelings. Well, I'm sorry. Well, I forgive you. But now we want our money. Whoa, bro, easy. The next game Gene plays, you'll notice a real diff. Too bad, by then, I'll be setting up my winter camp in Arizona. Deucing in the desert. Aw, you're gonna miss Gene hitting all those home runs. And you're gonna miss the leaves changing. He's not better, Lin. It's not a real baseball camp. He is so better. I wish there was a game right now. He'd show you, buddy. You know, what? A game right now. Let's do that. Yeah, let's do that. Well, let's not rush into anything. Some of my training takes a little time... to sink in. Oh, don't be modest, The Deuce. You know what you're doing. He's gifted; He said so. He's gonna do a TED Talk. Okay, look, I got to go. No, no, no, no, you're not going anywhere. We've got enough people here for a game in that vacant lot right there. Now, if Gene gets a hit... which he won't, because you're a fraud... you keep the money. If not, we get a full refund. That sounds really complicated. I didn't get it either. Play ball! Play ball. ♪ For the land of the free ♪
♪ And the home of the brave. ♪ Okay, first base is The Deuce's baggy of deodorant, second and third are his Rollerblades, and home is his hemorrhoid pillow. Play ball! You can do it, Gene. Get a hit and disappoint your father. Okay. No hit, no hit, no hit, no hit! Come on, Gene. Wait for a big fat one right over the ass pad. The Deuce: Here it comes, Gene. Nothing to be afraid of. ♪ (grunts) (gasps) Oh, my God, you hit it... I mean, of course you hit it, I'm a great coach. Gene hit it. That's a hit. It's n a hit if somebody catches it. Call it, someone. I got it! I got it! Wait, do you want it? No, not if you want it. You can have it. But it sounded like you wanted it. Make up your minds! Both: Let's share it! No, no, don't share it! (grunts) No! Now it's a hit. (grunting) Hey, he's still running. Throw to first. Throw to first base! Ah, you're such a d!ck, Bob. (panting) Ow. That had some mustard on it. For real. No! It's a hit! It's an error, not a hit. Gene got a hit, you jerk. You're blind. Put some lenses in those things! I'm blind to marry you! Why don't you steal home, you thief? You've stolen everything else. You love a coffee machine more than you love your son. Get your finger out of my face. You're out of here, pal! Get your finger out of my face! Stuff it up your crackerjacks! Your fat finger! Hey, there goes The Deuce. Bob: Oh, crap. Oh, no, no, no, no. (sighs) I'm really gonna miss that guy. He gave us his magic and then he disappeared. Just like Toad the Wet Sprocket. Are we going to the pizza party now? No. Oh. Hey, Mr. Belcher, just wait till next year. Don't. Don't do that. What are you doing? Don't do that. (kids cheering) See, Bob, it was all worth it. Gene learned confidence. From a confidence man. I got conned good. And that ain't bad. I guess I'm happy that Gene's happy. But that espresso machine just really made me proud, that's all. That dirty hunk of junk? I'm glad it's gone. It wasn't good for Tina. Where is Tina? (gulping) That pot is a week old. (gulping) I put my cigarettes out in that. (coughs) (gulping) Do you want cream or sugar? ("Electric Boogie" by Marcia Griffiths playing) ♪ You can't see it ♪
