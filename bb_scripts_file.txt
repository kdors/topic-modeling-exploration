Listen, pep talk. Big day today. It's our grand re-re-re-opening. It's labor day weekend, And it looks like wonder wharf is getting mobbed. So we have to-- Big day for another reason, too! Linda, I'm in the middle of my pep talk. Go ahead, sorry. Go ahead, do your pep. So we have to sell some burgers. [fart noise] Every year, this weekend Makes or breaks us. Who's farting? It's gene's sound effects thing. I thought that made you sound like a robot. It does robot voice, laser sound, And fart noise. [fart noise] Oh, god. Listen, your mother and I Have to go downstairs and grind the meat. But you kids know where you're supposed to be while we're gone, right? Tina, you're on the grill. My crotch is itchy. All: Oh! Ok. Are you telling me as my daughter, Or as my grill cook? Um, as... Because my grill cook would never tell me that. Oh. Also, my daughter Should probably not say anything like that to me. Tell her. Tell your mom. My crotch is itchy. Come here, let me see. Linda. Not now. No, let's all see it. No. I'm just not sure if I'll be any good on the grill With just one free hand. Ok, I'm just going to keep moving here. Louise, you're working the counter. I put your little step stool back here. But do not alter anything on the chalkboard. Well, what if I think of something better? Which would be almost impossible not to do. You will not think of something better, Because "new bacon-ings" is perfect. It's hilarious. Right? You know what, I'm taking the chalk. Like I don't have chalk. Gene, you're outside, nicely offering people A free sample, all right? I'm on it! But people coming out of the crematorium next door; People obviously in mourning... Yeah? Don't offer them samples. Dad, when I'm in character out there, I get in a zone! I can't keep track of who's in mourning and who isn't. Just anyone with an urn... Yeah? Leave 'em alone! I know you think it's the gene show out there, But there's a line between entertaining and annoying. No! That's a myth. [laser sounds] [fart sounds] All right, listen. You're my children and I love you. But you're all terrible at what you do here, And I feel like I should tell you, I'd fire all of you if I could. Bob! All right, hands in. Don't--tina, don't put your hand in. Tina: What... All right. Sell some burgers! All, softly: Sell some burgers. [crying] Bob's burgers! [robot voice] free sample! [laser noise] Come and get it. [fart noise] [fart noise] Aahh! I don't like leaving the kids alone up there for this long. Something bad's gonna happen. Bob, they're fine. Please, I asked you a question. Yes, what was the question? Do you remember our wedding night? Yes. We worked 'cause we couldn't afford not to. I remember. You know you're grinding too fast. Slow down. What was the date? The date? Yes, the date of our wedding! I don't know. Oh, crap. Is it today? Yes, bob! Today's our anniversary. Yes, it is! I'm sorry. Baby, I'm sorry. I'm not good with dates, you know that. Today's your birthday? Yes, bob! Today's my birthday? Yes, bob! Your due date was today? Yes, bob! How'd it go? How do you think it-- good. It went very well. That's good. Boy or girl?

Yes, they're down in the basement Grinding the meat right now. Uh-huh. That's not a euphemism. They're really grinding the meat. Show us the kitchen, please. I'm just saying, it's easy to remember our anniversary. It's September third. 9/3. 9 is divisible by 3. What? That's not-- A lot of numbers are divisible by 3. Don't argue with me. All right, you're right, 9 is divisible by 3, And now I'll remember. [gasps] oh, my god. Are you messing with me? What? What are you--no. You are. I-- you are! Lin, I forgot. I am sorry. I said I'm sorry. And I'm going to make it up to you. I can see you smiling. I'm not smiling! You're smiling with your eyes. What is it? What are you doing? A party?! Why are you doing this? Is it a party upstairs?! No, linda, can you please just finish this? I gotta get back up there. Oh! To get everything ready for the party? No! To get everything ready for lunch, In our restaurant, the one we're trying to save, remember? Go ahead. Go. Call me to come up when it's all ready. I'll act surprised, like this-- [gasps] ahh! That's-- ohh! I almost had a heart attack! That's scared, that's not surprised. Ahhh! That's like you hurt yourself. Ahhh-ahhh! That's good. Smell this. Doesn't it smell like strawberries? [sniffs] ugh! Gotcha. It's spoiled milk, dummy. So you're the health inspector? Yes. 'cause I think I have some kind of rash or something. I'm not that kind of health inspector. Rashy grill cook. [toilet flushes] You have no idea What I've just been through. Do I have any toilet paper stuck to my buns? [fart noise] Where are the grown-ups?! [door opens] Aha! You must be bob. Uh, who are you? We're from the health inspectors office. I'm hugo, this is my partner ron. I don't have a badge yet. I just started. [fart noise] Give me that. Come on! Bob, this is my violations notebook.

Not to mention child labor law violations, Public decency violations-- Public decency? What--what are you talking about? The child molester? I thought this was a family restaurant. Uh, what's the child molester? It's the burger of the day. No, it's not. For a limited time only. Till you came back upstairs. Did someone actually order this? Yeah. Who? Him. Huh. He looks like a child molester. Louise, don't serve him. Let gene bring it. Uh, bob-- Why do I have to get m*lest*d? Because he's not going to molest you. Why? Because you're heavy. Bob-- yeah, hold on. Heavy kids can get m*lest*d! Yeah, who wouldn't want to molest this face? That's enough. It's not that. Bob-- I mean, gene, 'cause you're older. Tina's the oldest. Make her do it. Yeah, but tina's not good with the customers. Bob-- I'm good with the customers. No. No. Mmm, not really. I'm great with the customers. Mmm. Mm-mmm. She's autistic, she can't help it. Yeah, I'm autistic. Bob-- just a sec. No, you're not autistic, tina. How many toothpicks on the ground? Don't play this game again. Come on. How many toothpicks? No. It just involves me cleaning up toothpicks. A hundred? Bob! No. A hundred? It's three! There's three! Ok, ok, how many now? Bob! Three. Both: No! Ugh, you're the worst kind of autistic. You can't even count. Bob! You want to know why we're here? Because I'll tell you, it's not for a routine inspection. It's not? No. We're investigating a very disturbing rumor. There's a rumor you make your burgers With human remains from the crematorium next door! Hmm. I wonder how a rumor like that gets started. It's made with human remains From the crematorium next door. [all gasping] Who knows? Kids say crazy stuff. Here's what's gonna happen. We'll test your meat. If it contains human flesh Anything above the 4% allowable by the fda, Then your restaurant will be closed, And you, sir, will be going to jail. Oh, a party for me! Oh. Hugo? Linda? What are you doing here? I'm the health inspector. I just transferred here. [gasps] What are you doing here? This is our restaurant. We own it. You're married to him? How do you two know each other? I thought you ran off with bob, The hot sh*t restaurateur . I did. Oh, god. You did? I'm on it. Yeah, I don't think so! I can't believe-- I can't-- I-- I can't believe you left me for him! You left someone for me? Ugh! He doesn't even know? We were--we were briefly engaged. [all gasping] I still remember the day I heard you were getting married. Oh, my god. Is today your anniversary? Yes! How do you remember that? It's 9-3. 9 is divisible by 3. That doesn't make sense! A lot of numbers are divisible by 3. Well, happy anniversary. Human flesh?! Wait, wait, wait, wait. This is one of our biggest weekends. You can't put that up. Nobody will eat here. Prominently displayed. Well, then just do your tests, pal, because it's beef. Sorry! The lab's closed till Monday. You'll get your test results then. Consider yourself health inspectored! [screaming] I--I'd try it. There's no wait. Hello, how are you? Come in and have a burger. A perfectly normal burger. Best burger in town. [screaming] Did your father say anything About an anniversary present? Kids: No. Nothing? Like maybe hiding a necklace In a hamburger, Or hiding some earrings down the drain, Or something romantic like that? That's romantic? Yeah! Yeah. Did you check the toilet or in the garbage? Ahh. Gene, get off. You're choking me. Whee! You're choking me! [screaming] So is hugo going to put dad in jail Because you dumped him? No. Hugo is going to put your father in jail Because your sister Told her class that we serve human flesh. Now why would you do something like that, honey? Why? I'll tell you why, mom! Anita vasquez's uncle is a matador in Spain. She was showing everybody his cape. I had to up the ante, And what do I have to show for show and tell? I got nothing, mom! Calm down. There's nothing here to show! Louise... What?! Tina, stop. [screaming] Mom, you can get hugo to take down the sign. How am I supposed to do that? He's madly in love with you. Work it, woman. Yeah. [groans]   [hugo crying] ["never gonna give you up" playing on cell phone] Hello? Linda?! Bob: It's our big weekend. I mean, this grill should be covered with burgers right now. Who's that for? Mort.

I think I can talk him out of it, All of this. And when you say "talk him out of it," what does that mean? Is hugo going to be our new dad? Oh, please. Just checking. Maybe I should help you set the mood. Put out some candles. Ooh, candles! Ugh, unbelievable. Bob's burgers delivery service! Shh, shh, shh, shh! Quick! Why'd you ever get engaged to that guy, anyway? Ahh, I was young. And my parents liked him Because he always did the dishes. Yeah, I bet. Ha! Also, he-- He used to... What? He, uh, he happened to be an excellent kisser. What--an excellent kisser? Yeah. He was very soft, And he didn't have a lot of moisture. Like some people. Like some people? You think I'm a bad kisser? No... Oh, yeah, well, how about this? Oh--oh. Are you sweating? Uh, no.

"I came in search of human remains, "and I found a piece of human flesh I thought I'd never see again--my heart." Mm-hmm. Very nice! Uh, hugo, you know bob's not a cannibal, right? I don't know that. Don't do this. I'm sorry I hurt you-- Linda! I can save you from all this! Wow. A candy coffin. Customized caskets and urns, that's our specialty. That's mr. Caffrey Of the caffrey toffee company. It's on the lift 'cause they're coming To pick 'em up this afternoon. I need more condiments. Don't touch anything and don't press any buttons. Oh, my god! It's bob anniversary present, he remembered! Aww. This is so exciting. It's a dead body! Maybe the present's underneath. You're on a sinking ship, lady. And you better get off before the ship sinks! Hello, the media? [all shouting] [clapping] Good job, everybody. An angry mob, That's just what we wanted outside our restaurant. They're over there, in their little van, Inspecting themselves. [indistinct] Do you think I should change where I part my hair? Uh, let me see. Uh, yes? Can you open the window a little more? I'm not going to as*ault you. Don't touch me! Sorry. That just came over me. Listen, I came out to ask you to talk to this crowd. I mean, you made an angry mob here. Huh. Hey, what's all this stuff? You got a whole chemistry lab back there. Can't you do the test here, Instead of ruining my weekend? Don't tell me how to do my job. I don't tell you how to grow your corpses. Come here. Aah! No! Let go of me! Good luck with the angry mob, bob! Uh, how close am I to that car? You want me to help you get out of your spot? Yeah! I can't see his bumper? Am I close? No, you got room. Keep coming. Keep coming. Stop. How am I doing in front? It's tight. Keep comin'. All right, cut the wheel. Cut the wheel! I am, I am, I'm cutting it. You gotta cut hard right when you-- Just get out, I'll do it. Oh, my god. Bob's confronting the crowd. I'm going out there. You kids stay inside. Hey, people! This is crazy. We're being smeared by an unstable health inspector For personal reasons. We know you people, and you know us. You, you're the shoe repair guy. Nope. Locksmith. I mean the locksmith, the locksmith. I had keys made by you. So? That was...Great, right? Hmm. Fair. All: Boo! No, no, no booing. No booing mort. You know him, too. He's one of us. This guy has been here forever. Ever since I got run out of bog harbor. What? Why'd you get run out of bog harbor? For selling human flesh to the restaurants. [all gasping] Ha ha, I'm kidding, people! Come on. [all chuckling] Hey, the subject of d*ath makes us all uncomfortable, Except mort. But what about how we treat the living? 'cause sometimes we end up treating those bodies Better than we treat these bodies. We break each other's hearts. We forget important dates. We write hurtful things on poster board. We mistreat the living and no one seems to care. But once that body's dead, It's, "hey, don't mistreat the dead body! "hey, don't eat the dead body!" That's the ultimate crime, right? m*rder, no big deal. Cannibal? Whoa! Is he defending cannibalism? No, I'm just saying-- cannibal! See, that's a new jersey-- damn cannibal! Folks, please, I'm trying--no. Cannibals! That's not what I mean! He's gonna eat us! [distorted yelling] Oh, thank god it didn't break. Dad, dad! Forget it. Never mind. Nada. No longer relevant. He's right, isn't he? We can test this meat right here In the mobile lab, can't we? We liquefy it, add the enzyme. If it's yella, salmonella, If it's chartreuse, it's a deuce, And if it's blue, it's your aunt sue. I know, ron! I know the rhyme! Don't you think I know the rhyme?! It doesn't matter. Don't you see, he's guilty. If it's not human flesh, it's something else. It's dirty hand towels. It's--it's something else! Stealing your woman? Nuhh! Ugh. Shut up, shut up, shut up! [sobbing] Oh, ok, that's it, that's it. Let it out. Let it out. [bob sighs] You're a failure. You failed. You fail at everything. You fail at marriage. You fail at family. Your kids are failures. And you're fat. You're not attractive. You never were. Well, you were a little bit, when you were a teenager. But then you got fat. What is he saying out there? He's talking to the restaurant, mom. Bobby, stop talking to the restaurant and come inside. Leave me alone! Bob, come inside. Come on. Bob, come on. Bobby. What's the use?! Dad? This is louise, your daughter. Yes, louise. What? I'm sorry that I told everyone That we make burgers from human remains. [sighs] ok, louise. Thank you. Dad, it's gene. Yes, gene, go ahead. Dad? Yes! I think we have a bad connection. I'll call you back. Oh, my god. I want to talk to him, too. I can hear you. It's just glass. Oh. [sniffs] Now my rash smells like bacon. And it doesn't itch anymore. I think we're going to be ok. Ok, tina, thank you. Louise: Dad, is the restaurant going to close? [sighs] I don't know, louise. We're almost broke. The whole town thinks we're cannibals, And I forgot our anniversary. You'd have been better off with hugo, linda. Bob, please. No, it's true. I can't even satisfy you with my kisses. Sorry, kids. No problem. Thanks for the info. Oh, bobby! Now you listen to me. I would rather be married To a suspected cannibal with a dream like you Than a soft-lipped guy Who never had a dream in the first place. You would? No question. You're a hero to your kids and to me. Now come inside. Come inside And make us some food. We're hungry. I'm in. I'm comin' in. [kids chuckling] Open the door. Ha ha. Open the door. Seriously, open the door! Kids, let your father in the restaurant, please. Let me in! Still serving human flesh. No. Yes! No! We have kind of an adventurous eaters club. We like to try new things. Can you seat 25 people? Oh, uh...Well, we might have Some more human meat, but it's, uh, $50 a burger. That's a deal. Really--what? Really? Great. [chuckles] let's do it. Hello. Welcome. Human flesh right this way. Uh, hi. Uh, hugo wanted to give you this. It states clearly that there was no human flesh in-- Shh! Shh. Yes, yes. Thank you. Thanks. We were able to expedite the tests, And we found 100% grade a beef-- shh, shh! Ron! I'm just sorry-- Shut up! Shut up. Ok. Hi. Welcome. Linda, I can't believe how much money we just made. This turned into a great weekend. Oh, bob, it's gorgeous. Hmm. We seem to have stopped. Ahh. Bobby! You've been practicing. Yeah. I went online, got some tips. They have kissing tips online? I learned a few moves. Check this one out. This one is your anniversary gift. [both giggling] Oh, bobby! Go, bob! Ugh, unbelievable. Aww, sick! Mom's really handsy. You're a couple of sluts! I think it's nice. Hey! Get this thing movin'! I'm getting scarred for life up here!
[plays back chewing] Gene. [adds reverb] Gene. Gene. [burps] what? Stop. Bob, no more newspaper, please. My parents are gonna be here any minute. I know. You know how I know they're coming? Because you go into a crazy cleaning frenzy every time. It's like the way animals freak out before an earthquake. That's nice. That's not true. She's spooked. Louise, you're gettin' cereal everywhere. I'm having a seizure! Put a wallet in my mouth! It passed. Look at this place. It's a disaster. You haven't even fixed the leak yet. Come on. Linda, the leak is contained. Bobby! What? You barely notice those. Aah! I'm ok. Trust me, Bobby. My mother will notice that our ceiling is leaking. [sighs] Yeah, you're right. She will, repeatedly and loudly. Just fix it, please. Be my All-American fix-it man, Bobby. Fine. I'll go up to the attic and fix the leak. But I also need you and the kids to work out Whose room my folks are sleepin' in, Because I have to go check the bathroom for stray hairs. No one sheds like this family. It's like a bunch of chewbaccas. So where are grandma and grandpa gonna sleep? Gene's room smells like farts. That makes sense. Great. Well, we'll put 'em in there, then. Maybe they'll leave sooner when they smell farts. Yeah. Gene can sleep with me in my room As long as he doesn't mind my night terrors. Huh? Remember, you let me watch "night of the living dead" when I was 8, So now I wake up every night standing in the middle of my room, Scratching the air, and kicking. Oh, good. Wait. You still get those? Yeah. They're weirder now. Oh, boy. I think my subconscious fears and my budding sexuality Are getting all mixed up. Ok, I--Tina, I don't want to hear it. So I think I'm being attacked by zombies, And I start screaming, "do you wanna make out?" And I make out with it. Hmm. I might just bunk with Gram and Gramps. Ok, enough. Gene, Louise, you sleep in Tina's room. Tina, you're quarantined. You sleep alone. We'll strap you down or something. Leave my lips free. Hey. Hey! Gene, just 'cause grandma and grandpa are comin', Doesn't mean you're gonna get out of doin' homework. How far are you on that history report? So far, I just got the title-- "history: A blast from the past." Ok. After we get my parents settled, Your father's gonna help you with that. Right, bob? Have it on my desk by 5:00. I am not writing your report for you. Hey! Ok, everybody, I have an announcement to make. I am on a ladder. Stop shaking it. I feel like I shouldn't have to say that. Dad, why do you get so mad when grandma Gloria And grandpa al come over to visit? Do you hate them? I don't hate them. Just grandma. Or I don't hate her, just the sound she makes And her voice and the things she says. Agh! Al! [all gasp] [clears throat] [sighs] Wanna hear my impression of her? Yes. Al! Linda: I'm not hearing this, right? Sorry. I mean, she's your Gram Gram. We love her. [whispering] We hate her. I fixed the leak! Good! Don't stay up there too long, 'cause I wanna sorta have a nice visit Before we open the restaurant! Uh, I mean, almost done! Huh? Wow. This is amazing. Eh, whose room am I behind?! Tina: Mine. Hi, Tina. Are you in the wall or in my horse poster? Please say, "horse poster." I'm a horse. [neighs] Oh, wait. I can go sideways, too. Are you in another dimension? Do you see a lion or a witch or a wardrobe? A what? A lion, a witch, or a wardrobe! Why are you saying that, Gene? It's a book. Oh, right, right. A kid's book. Yeah. Yeah, by salman rushdie. It's not by salman rushdie. Of course it is. It isn't. Yes, it is. I'm not gonna talk to you anymore, Gene. I'm in a wall. Go look it up, though. I just did. It's salman rushdie. [doorbell rings] Linda: They're here! Bob, come out of the wall, please! Yeah. Hello! Al! Oh, my god. Don't leave our bags out there on the street. Are you crazy?

You're never gonna believe this. What is it? What? I'm stuck! [fanfare plays] [sniffs] Shouldn't have farted. Gloria: Who's trapped in the wall? Bob. Bob: Me. Bob can't fit in the wall. He's overweight. Mom. What? He can't hear me. Yes, I can. I'm right here. I'd like to order a hamburger. No, al! He can't have a hamburger. He can have a turkey burger. There's no such thing as a turkey burger. Go read your "maxim." Dad gets "maxim"? No. He found it in the recycling at the condo. Who's on the cover? The girls of "coyote ugly." I don't think they're even alive anymore. Lin, we need to open the restaurant. Hey, I bet I can get down there. What are you talking about? You can go down? Kids, you meet me down there, ok? You're gonna be my eyes and my hands. Ok. We're down there. No, you're not. You haven't moved! I'm turning on the grill! Beep boop. Whoosh! That's not the sound the grill makes.

Are you very, very busy today? Uh, no. You're in a tight spot, huh, Bobby? A little bit, Teddy. Ehh. I've heard of buildings like this, you know, With false walls. Uh-huh. It's a prohibition thing.

Y-you're coming for a home visit when? Right there. Chop. Don't do it. I'm staying in here. He's loopy. Chop. I'm never coming out! Yeah, we see this all the time. I'll chop a hole, but it's probably not gonna do it. You'll have to put some food out. What's going on? They probably got complaints about the smell And came to get the body out of the wall. You mean it's still in there? Well, parts of him. Oh, my god. It's a real crisis, Mr. Frond! Yeah. It's a crisis! Yeah! Crisis! We're all in crisis! All right! Ok! Don't you take my daddy out of the wall! Bob, I'm sitting here With the counselor from school, Who thinks you're dead, So this would be a great time to grow up and help out. Bob: A counselor? What is this, camp? Heh heh heh. I'm funny in the wall. I--ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Your husband is not dead? No, just aggravating. Ok, why would Louise let me think that he was dead?

Much better. Bad modeling, poor boundaries-- Well, really, no boundaries. I'm gonna have to make some calls. Wait, Mr. Frond, now that I have a clear head, I want to apologize to everybody. Hiding in the walls was selfish and dumb. And, Linda, I'm sorry I called you Nagatha Christie. It was in the heat of the moment, And it was really dumb. Aww. Thank you, Bobby. I mean, I can do better, Like spiro nagnew. Heh. All right, quit while you're ahead. Naggedy ann? Secretary of nagriculture? Ha! Now, that one's funny. That one's funny. I like--ha ha ha! I'm not a-- I'm not a nag. That's funny, though. I like it. Social services? Now, hold on there, pal. Hey--eh! Are you married? You have kids? No a-and no. Listen to me. My daughter is the best mother in the world, And this one, he is nuts, but guess what. Having a family makes you go nuts. So if you don't have kids, I don't think you know enough To be calling in anyone. In fact, I don't think you come out Looking so good here yourself. I wonder if you even got permission from the school To come over here today. He didn't. He took us away from learning! We were in the car with Mr. Frond, And he didn't make us wear seat belts. What?! [stammers] How about you put your phone and your little notebook Back in your pocket there and leave this family alone! Heh. Ok. All right. All right. All right. All right. Gloria, thank you. Come back soon, you two. Bye, Gram. Bye, Gramps. See you in my dreams. Well, I have a room to refart. Dad, can I have my night light back now? No. Give it to me. Stop it. Give it to me. Stop it. Give it. Stop it. It's my night light. No. Stop. This is embarrassing to me. No! You're a grown man! I'm keeping it!
Ok, kids, thank you for joining me here In the walk-in. Thank you all. You said we had to, so... Shush. Brr! I should have brought my cardigan. I have an announcement about the restaurant. Here in this box is the beef That will make our-- Gene, drumroll, please. [imitating rock 'n' roll drum solo] Ok, enough. Gene. [slows and stops drums solo] Here in this box is the beef That will make our 100,000th burger. Wow. Can I touch it? I wanna touch it, too. I wanna feel it between my toes. Mmm. I wanna put a stick of dynamite in it And blow it up! No. What is wrong with all of you? No one's touching this meat but me. I have an announcement, too. My bra is chafing me. That's not a real announcement. Oh! I have one. I love... House music. There! I said it! [imitating house beat] And I'm going to get my g*n license, Finally. Oh, congratulations. Can't believe they're making you wait 3 days. Stop stealing my thunder! I found the banner! It's from our old printer. You just have to tear off the holes on the side. We were supposed to hit 100,000 ages ago. Heh. We were way off. Yeah. Big time. Ha hah! Can I just-- stop it! Tina: There it is. Get it! Dive! Oh, my god. [both moan] [sizzles] Are you number 100,000? [high-pitched] No. [normal] Are you mad at me? [high-pitched] No. [normal] Oh, burger, you're cute. [high-pitched] You're cute, too. [normal] Heh. I'm not. Whoa. Linda! I think the news is here! I wonder if they heard about our 100,000th burger! What?! Hi. How are you? Uh, what can I do for you? Are you Bob? Uh, yeah. I am. I'm Randy Watkins, The documentary filmmaker. Ok. Uh... We're making a film about the beef industry. I heard you were about to hit Your 100,000th burger, And I wanted to shake your hand. Oh. Yeah. Um... Because you, sir, have blood on your hands. Eww. Is this ketchup? It's the blood of 100,000 slaughtered cows. You ketchuped me. We're here to force you to face your victims. Meet your meat. What the hell? Her name is Moolissa. She's due to be "Processed" in 5 days, Bob, Unless you choose to spare her life. Wh-why? That's right. You will decide her fate. It's a cow... ntdown. We'll see what your conscience tells you When you're looking your burger right in the eye. Ow! This is ridiculous. It's not a crime to make burgers. There's no blood on our hands! What's all the yelling about? Louise: Turns out dad's been putting m*rder*d cows in our hamburgers. And you made us a part of it! You make me sick. Kids, please. Oh, look. A cow. Hello, Blondie. Oops. I got some meat on you. Dead cow on live cow. Gross. Heh heh. Ohh. God. Uh, not a good time, Linda. Heh heh. Ooh. Randy, stop. Stop filming. You know, We're not gonna be in your cow documentary anymore. Well, you don't really have a choice, Bob, 'cause I stop at nothing to expose injustice to animals. Is that wig glued on? Yeah. It's-- it's the only way it would stay put. It's to, uh, humanize her. It's cute. Mmm. I've seen cuter. Honestly, she's a 4. Randy, I--I don't know where to begin. You know, this isn't even a female cow. Beef happens to come from steers, which are male cows. Then, uh, how do you explain that udder? Whoa. What an udder. Bob: Get away from there, Tina. That's, uh, not an udder. Oh, it's not? Don't listen to him, Randy. You go ahead and milk that cow. Milk it good. Oh, we did. You shouldn't have. Milk doesn't come out of that. Somethin' came out of it in that bucket over there. You mean this bucket of urine? I know urine, and that's urine. Gene, put that down. No! Well, it certainly smells like urine, But that's probably because she's sick. No, she's not sick. Sick of your practices, Bob! Ok. You know, we're gonna go inside and call animal control, And then you'll have to leave. [kids moan] Ok, so you've got all your permits, And you're renting this storefront? Yes. Oh, yeah. And, uh, this cow has had all its shots? Yes. Sure, sure, sure, sure. All right. Well, uh, great. My job is done. I'll see you guys later. Bye. Bye. Bye, animal man. What? Oh, will you sign A release to be in the movie? Uh, yeah. A movie. Yes. You're gonna be a star! Excuse me. Hello. Thank you. The person who called you. Thank you. You can't have a cow on the sidewalk. It's dangerous. Sir, sir, the only thing dangerous about this cow Is how adorable it is. Moo. Put your hand on this cow and touch it. What? I just know that that's gonna help you. Touch the cow. Kids: Touch the cow. Touch the cow. I'm walking away. Touch it. Oh, right. Run away, tough guy! Yeah! Go take a meat bath! Or whatever it is you people do! "Dial 'M' for mooder," interview one, take one. [clears throat]  Ma ma ma ma  Mi mi mi mi  Perfect. Do you think cows should be ground up for food? Personally, I don't really care, But my father, he loves grinding them up. Gives him a rush. Makes him feel alive. Daddy's a bad, bad man. Is this movie gonna have a score? You know, some music to tug at the heartstrings. I--I haven't thought about it yet. Well, check this out. [backbeat playing] [plays dog bark] Think about it. Louise, what does that look like to you? Cow poop. Good eye, Tina. Good eye. No. I mean it's in the shape of a smiley face, Like an emoticon. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You think the cow is texting you an emoticon With its butt. Very interesting. Maybe this cow is trying to communicate with us The only way it knows how, with its feces. Like Gram-Gram used to do. Mom, let's say you had a brilliant plan, but to execute it, You needed to write something using cow poop? How would you do it? Oh. Is this a brainteaser? Hmm. I would use a frosting bag. Do we have one? Yeah, in the pantry. Am I right? Is it a frosting bag? We'll see, mom. Ahh. [chuckles] [evil laughter] Yeah. Okey-dokey. Bye, kids. Have a good day. m*rder*r! [groans] Oh. Hi, Randy. Whoa. Wink with open smile. Is this for me? It has to be. What should I do? Should I text back? Comin' through. [squish] Oh, no. Ehh. Enh. Aww. That's really cute. It makes me hungry. Let's eat now. What's wrong with you people?! Yeah! What's wrong with you people?! Now let's talk about your music budget. Is it a million? We only need one megaphone out here. You know what you need? You need this! [backbeat playing] [plays dog bark] Think about it! Wow. We're mobbed. Thank you, documentary. Linda, the documentary is about me being an evil cow k*ller. Louise: m*rder*r! Oh, come on, Bob. There's no such thing as bad publicity. This could be huge for us. Like a s*x tape. Like a s*x tape. Uhh. It's the best free advertising we ever had. I know. It's almost sad. For who? I don't know. The cow. The cow's goin' out In a blaze of glory. Everybody wins, Bob. I guess you're right. I mean, looks kind of sweet out there-- Enjoying the day, meeting people. Hi, cow. I'm gonna eat you. Whoa. Can it hear us? [Linda munching] Easy. Like sands through the hourglass, There goes my teeth right into your back. That's my wife. Ah, Bobby, I'm friggin' starvin'. Who could eat that beautiful creature? Shame on you! Are you going to be eating a burger today? We wouldn't dream of eating an animal. We run a petting zoo by the interstate. It's called mother goose's discount petting zoo. Petting horses, goats, and sheep. Precious memories on the cheap. It's basically an animal sanctuary... That we make money off of. Exactly. [chuckles] Oh. Hey, Randy, thanks for the business. [sarcastic] Oh, hey, Bob, you're welcome. Well, I'm gonna go to bed soon. What are you gonna do? Oh, I'll probably go to bed, too, 'cause I'm a person. Bye. [sizzling] M-Moolissa, watch out! No! Bring in the accused. [crowd clamoring] Yeah, yeah. Louise, you're defending me? [gavel bangs] This so-called "Man" stands accused Of murdering nearly 100,000 hamburgers worth of cows. I call to the stand Moolissa. [crowd murmuring] Objection! That cow's faking his injuries! And I can prove it. Think fast. Overruled. Moolissa, is the man who k*lled you In the courtroom today? Bob: It's me! It's me. I just make hamburgers. I never wanted to be a cow k*ller. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [gasps]   [snores] Whoa. Heavy sleeper. Wha--what happened? What's the matter? What's the matter? Go back to bed. [sighs] I'm sorry. Go back to bed. [thunder crashes] [Moolissa mooing] Hey! Randy! Your cow's gonna freeze to d*ath out here! Randy! Bob: Shh. Easy. Easy. Back up. Back up. Back up. [gasps] Oh, my god. Heh. I know. It's a cow! You know what? You won't even know it's here. Uh, that was like that already. Definitely clean that. Oop. Step back. This is the best dream I've ever had! Everybody pee on the floor! Who's with me?! Ok, eat while it's hot. Well, well, well. Look who's too good for cereal now. He's trying to impress the cow. Don't be ridiculous. Someone knows how to treat A lady-slash- male steer. Bob, I am not comfortable with this situation. Lin, what was I supposed to do? I had that crazy dream. It was raining. Well, I had a crazy dream That there wouldn't be a cow's a-s-s In my face when I'm eating my breakfast. I know what that spells. Ass. Ass. Mom. Heh. Ass. Stop it. Say good-bye, everybody. It's going out On the street, where it belongs. Of course, ok? Of course. Right after breakfast. Cows can't go down stairs. What? What's that? Cows can't go down stairs. That's, like, a thing. I've heard that. It's like a fun fact. Bobby... Hmm. Cows can't go down stairs? That better not be true. [Bob grunting] Huh. What do you know? We know you'll push on a cow's butt For half an hour without asking for help. Gotta have that butt all to yourself. Randy: Hey, Bob! What's the deal, man? What'd you do to Moolissa? It's up here! Come get it out! Linda. Uh, it's not up here, Randy. My wife's crazy. Shh. If he knows I brought the cow in, He'll think he won. So what if he won? Get the cow out of the house now. Stop. You get it out of the house. I'm trying to-- come get-- Oh. Uh, this cow. This cow, yeah, is here. Aha! Dad, I ran that bubble bath For you and Moolissa like you wanted. Bubbles! I'm not taking a bath with Moolissa, Randy. 2 days left. 2 days to decide to send that cow to slaughter Or admit you're a hypocrite and a m*rder*r. Wow. What a movie. Bob, what a movie. It's not my movie, teddy. What, are they just Followin' you around with a camera? You're in it, you're the star, But it's not your movie. Heh. Good luck, guys. Will you sign a release? Sure.

Just relax and--pbbbt! It's all about the communication Pbbbt. Uh-oh. Hi, Moolissa. [gasps] Frowny face? All I've been is super nice to you, And this is the thanks I get? I loved you. I loved you like a horse, Which is my favorite animal. You know what? Let's just stop Before we both say something we'll regret, Like that horses are better than cows. I regret that. But it's true. Where's the cow? I believe you mean, "Where's the steer? " Yeah. Don't forget about that pen1s. Yeah. Moolissa? Moolissa? Ha! Cows can go down stairs. All you need is 4 wool socks, A mattress, and the will to make it happen. You didn't. Your girlfriend is tied up outside. Uh-oh. Nooooo Oooo... What's wrong with dad? Oooo... I think he hates leashes. Ooo! It's not my fault, Randy. She was stolen. I mean, it's no one's fault. Except for Linda's. I did what I had to do To protect my family and my carpet. Yeah, whatever. So who do we know That would steal a cow in a blonde wig? Maybe some perverts. Heh heh. We had a fight last night, me and Moolissa. I just wish I had a chance to make things right again. You wouldn't if you heard some of the things she was pooping about you. Hey, guys! Take a look at this! [fast-forwarding] ...On the cheap. [fast-forwarding] You fellas just leave her tied up Here at night all alone? Oh, yeah, yeah. She doesn't mind. We could just back a trailer right up here, honey, huh? We sure could, get ourselves a cow. Yeah. Get ourselves a cow. Yeah. Get ourselves a c-- [both laughing] What a dump. Yikes. Hey, there she is. Oh, dear god. [gasps] Oh, the cow that jumped over the moon. See, that's nice. Come on. Let's go get her. We should come back after dark. Why? It's more dramatic. That is stupid. No. No, no, no. I can see it now, the big rescue. We'll sh**t the whole thing in infrared. Oh, Randy, com-- in infrared? This is nuts. The kids should be in bed, Bob. It's infrared, lin. Show her. Oh. Yeah. Coo! Coo! Why are you doing that? I'm signaling. Everybody, serpentine. Gene: Yes! We're a unit. Dad, you should know If anything happens, I am in full attack mode right now. Me, too. I'm hungry for blood. And also candy. Uh, thanks, kids. Damn it. I missed the signal to stand up. Sorry, everybody. You let down the unit. I said I'm sorry. Bob, we're here. What do we do now? We, uh, uh, open the gate. That was easy. What do you think you're doing? Louise: Gene, attack! Aah! Aah! Ow! Your children are biting my legs! Bob: Randy, get Moolissa. Let's move. [gnawing] High-five, Bob. We did it. High-five, Randy. Nice job. I mean, we couldn't have done it without the kids biting that woman. She tasted like sawdust and goats. 3, 2, 1. Beep. [buzzer] Gene: Uh-oh. Bob, the cow-ntdown's over. It's time to decide Moolissa's fate. Seriously? Right now? We just rescued her. She's due at the slaughterhouse, Bob. What's it gonna be? m*rder*r! Louise, shush. [gasps] Randy, can you stop making your stupid movie for one minute And just be a human being? I don't know, Bob. Can you stop making your stupid burgers For one minute and be a human being? So now you're gonna guilt-trip me? That's what the whole movie is about. I thought we were friends now, Randy, 'cause we saved the cow together! Maybe activists- slash-documentarians Can't have friends, no matter how many cows they save! Well, that's just sad, Randy! I know! [moo] [tires skid] Oh, my god. That was close. I don't know what I would do if anything Happened to moo-- [groans] Ahh. I didn't hit her! I didn't hit her! I--I stopped! She's probably fine.

Don't you die on me. Don't you die. Say something! Louise, look. It's a heart, A heart-shaped poop. What the hell? I didn't do that. I'm keeping it. Bob, you all right? You look a little pale.

There's something I want you to do for me. Make burgers out of me. What?! No. No way. Yes way, Bob. Look, ever since I met you, Making burgers makes me feel like a horrible person. Bob, I'm a castrated steer. Yeah, I'm a married man. [both laugh] Yeah, I'm kid-- Same thing, right? Yeah. Think about it, though. I'm a cow, you know? We're not wild stallions or humpback whales, But we wanna feel special, too. I do, anyway. You turn me into something amazing. Wait. Isn't this my subconscious Telling me what I want to hear? Hey, no. You know what? Yes, it is, actually. Well, it's working. Keep talking. Kiss me. No. I can't do that. You can, and you want to. [sighs] ok. One quick one because I owe you. Uh, maybe not.

[electronic backbeat playing] Before Moolissa, I used to say it's just beef. I couldn't have been more wrong. [bark bark] Cows are living creatures With beautiful hair and soft brown eyes, Soft mouths... Whoo! And also they are beef. They're the full package. [moo] Does that make me a hypocrite to say that? Yes. No, it doesn't, Randy. Or if it does, I can live with that. I present our 100,000th burger. [applause] 100,000th burger! All right! Right. Undo the banner. Bob's burger, 100,000! All right!

Jordan Sturman moved away, and now I'll never play kickball with him again. Oh, you should k*ll yourself. Yeah! Gene and Louise, be nice. You're gonna go through adolescence, too, you know. Like that? Oh, sick! Is she contagious? You shut up, mom! Watch it. You can't hurt me. I'm already dead. Can I have your mustache, then? It's only one hair. It's the beginning of a great thing. It's a huge hair. I can't cut it. It's beautiful. Leave her alone. You're beautiful, Tina. Let me pull it out. Let me put my foot on your chest. Gene, get off. Enough. Come on, gene. Let's go have a childhood. My heart. My heart. Shh, sweetie. I'm on the phone. Ginger is very upset. Ha ha! Go on, ginger. What? Ha ha ha! No! Come on, Tina. Get up. You're on the grill. Why? Come on. Cheer up, you know? We're having fun. We are? Yeah. Plus, it's father-daughter time. Why don't gene and Louise have to have fun like this? Well, Tina, you're the oldest, ("Love is blue" plays) and you have added responsibilities here, like on Saturday mornings, for example, you're on the grill. I can't trust them on the grill. You know that. Fire comes out of it. Ha ha! I know. It's awful. All right. Bye. Ginger's cat died but in a really funny way. Ha ha ha! Oh... Louise: Tina, we just saw the most amazing thing ever. This might be the best day of my life, besides the day you kids were born. Words can't explain this. You just have to see it. Come with us. Come on, Tina! I can't. Dad won't let me leave work... I mean, fun. He won't let me leave fun father-daughter time. You fell for that? That's not a real thing. Come with us. Aw, Bob, let her go. All right, fine, but you're gonna miss when I scrape off the grill. That's the best part of the day, although today has been pretty slow, so there's not gonna be as much gunk to... oh. Everyone is gone. Oh. Ow. Oh! Aren't you supposed to lead someone who's blindfolded? It would ruin the surprise. Where are we going? At first, we thought it was a breakdancing class, and them we thought it was a special needs class. Now we think it might be a special needs breakdancing class. Also, it's brazilian... Slash hilarious. Sounds interest... Stupid? Oh, it's even more stupid than you could possibly imagine. Just wait till we get near it. They take off their shoes so when they open the door, the whole block smells like feet. Feet that have been cooked in feet. [Music playing] Yes! Still funny. Ha! Oh! Ooh. Ooh. Can you smell that? That's just what's coming through the walls. [Sniffs] That smells exotic, like ranch dressing. Tina: Whoa, he's beautiful. That's a man? Where are you going? I'm signing up for that class. What? Why? Oh! Don't open the door! The smell will k*ll us all! Let me go. Let go of me. No! No! Oh, the feet smell. The feet smell. Wait. What is it? It's Capoeira. Capo-what? Tina, are you really sure you want to do this? Yes, dad. Wait till you see it. Jairo is amazing. I have a DVD. Oh, by the way, I need $14.95 for the DVD. Wait. What? What's jairo? Hyah! Ola. My name is jairo. Welcome to the world of Capoeira. Capoeira is the most seductive form of self-defense. It combines peacefulness, fighting, and cardio in perfect harmony. Capoeira is breathtaking, but it is also breath-giving. You can advance through the stages by earning different colored cords at the troca de cordoes. Bob: Wow, I thought maybe you were doing it wrong, but that's actually what it looks like. They're bringing the tambourine back. That's a pandeiro, a brazilian frame drum. It's a tambourine. I'm gonna get mine. Those guys don't know how to shake it. I don't get it. I mean, what am I looking at here? What is it? Is it some kind of dancing. What is it? Jairo says it's not dancing. It's a deadly form of street fighting. Oh, yeah? Well, you don't need some male model to teach you how to fight. That's what dads are for. Come on. I'll show you some stuff. Box with your old man, huh? Uh! Uh! There you go. Just got to... there it is. Uh! Whoa, Tina. Good fight. Good fight. That was fun to watch. Jairo says if there's any Capoeira inside me, he'll find it with enough classes. Jairo knows a lot about life. Hmm. Jairo says he can hypnotize animals. Shh. But only if they want to be hypnotized... Tina, shh shh shh shh. Which they almost always do. Tina! Jairo says toothpaste insults your teeth. Tina, go to bed. Jairo only needs two hours of sleep a night because he regulates his heart. Tina, get out. Jairo sleeps with his eyes open. Tina! Jairo: Ok. Just follow my lead. Sa! Sha! Brazil! Sa! Sha! Brazil! Jairo: Class is over. We now have an hour of open practice time, which is completely optional unless you're serious about Capoeira. Mm. Mm! Mm! Mm! Ho! Yah! Oh, I'm definitely staying. Jairo: Ah! Ho! Hih! Sa! Tina is supposed to be here to cover the grill. It's after 4:30. She's at a kookaburra class. Dad, the grill is doing that thing again. Ach. What is your problem with fire? You know what? Go. Go away. Go down and collect trash and bring it to the dumpster. Does it have to be from around here, or can we go anywhere? Just go. Yay! Yeah! Trash!  Trash! Trash! Trash! Trash!  Yesterday I found a necklace. It's time for my afternoon meeting, you know, in the bathroom. Your 4:30 meeting? Yeah, my 4:30. So go. No. Tina made a commitment to be here at a certain time. I'm going down there to remind her that she has a job here. Wait. What about your meeting? Well, I'm postponing it today. Bob, you can't do that. I'm gonna set a time for 10:30 tonight. This is why I tell you, Bob, just have little meetings throughout the day instead of one big one, little poops. Oof! Oh! That is horrible. Wash your feet. I have an infection. Tina. Tine. Psst psst psst. Dad, what are you doing here? You're supposed to be back at work, Tina, to cover me for my 4:30 meeting. Dad... Oh, hello. Please remove your shoes. Oh, I don't want to take off my shoes. I'm just picking up my daughter Tina. Oh, you are Tina's father. Ola. My name is jairo, like "gyrate." Ola. Mine is Bob. Are you sure you don't want to stick around? I enjoy helping elderly men repair their aging bodies. Thanks, but I got a job I got to get back to, and so does Tina, plus I don't really dance. Although Capoeira incorporates elements of dance, it is a highly dangerous form of martial arts. Right. I'm sure it is. It seems like a great way to stay in shape, like jazzercise. Not like jazzercise. Whatever you say. Class, would you like to see a demonstration? Come on, Tina. Let's go right now. Sha! Hyah! Sha! Hyah! Ok, ok. I saw your movie. It's very cute. Hyah! Ponytail! Hey! You can't do that. You just hit me with your hair. Ponytail! Stop that! Hyah! Sa! Huh! Oh! Uh-oh. Dad, let's go. Come on. Give me a second here. What about your meeting? I just had my meeting. Right now? Mm-hmm. Uh... Don't. Don't. What do we do? Grab me that flag. No, dad. Tina, we're gonna get out of there, all right? Just let me think. Shh! All right. I got an idea. You go into the corner and yell. What? Go in the corner and start yelling like you're having a heart attack, and I'll run out. Ok. Go. Go. Fast. Wait. Come back.. I'm having a heart... what? Don't... shh! Don't do that. It's a dumb idea. Dad, I'm so embarrassed. Oh, oh, are you? I'm sorry because I'm not embarrassed at all because I just pooped my pants. I would do this every day if I could, Tina. Linda: No, no. He's in the shower now. Well, sometimes it's hard to feel clean after something like that happens. It's very embarrassing. Ok, kids. Your father is very tender right now, all right? Whatever you do, do not mention what happened today at Tina's class. Just act normal. So you pooped your pants. Linda, let's not talk about it. Wasn't a fair fight. He's younger, and he's cute and strong. Linda, this isn't helpful. Hey, when you got to go, you got to go. Linda, stop! Are you on the phone with ginger? No. I got to go. Ha ha ha! Sorry, Bobby. I'm not laughing at you. I was thinking about ginger's dead cat again. Louise: Dad, dad, dad. Yes, Louise? Dad, dad, hi. Yes? Hi. Did you know that it only takes two pounds of pressure to drive someone's nose bone into their brain? That's... what? Two pounds. That's it, dad. Why are you telling me this, Louise? Revenge.  Revengeourine revengeourine revengeourine    Bob: Cut it out, gene. All right. Listen, everybody. What happened today is in the past, and we're never gonna talk about it again ever. I'm just glad Tina is quitting the class, right, Tina? But my body needs it. Your body needs to work in the restaurant with your father. Ohh...Oh, fine. If you need me, I'll be down here on the floor dying. All right. Sounds good, honey. Ohh... You have to learn to groan right, Tina. Ohh... Hey, she groans fine. It sounds weird. So you groan, then, if you're so good at it. Agh. That's a groan? Yeah. Agh. I'll do it. Let me do it. Agh. Aagh... Aggggh... Ach... Ahh... Meow meow... Aggggh... Brr brr! Gg gg gg! Ohh... Ohh... Tina, enough already. Come on. Louise: Tina, it's your boyfriend. Oh, God. Ola. What do you want? I got a message that Tina was very upset and needed to be encouraged to come back to the art of Capoeira. A message? From who? You're welcome, and...You're welcome. Well, I'm sorry. Tina is busy. She's working the grill. It's ok. I'll wait. Hmm. Ah... Uh...Well... What's wrong? Well, I'm looking for your fresh-squeezed juice selection. Is it on another menu? Ahem. Oh. Sorry. Here. Yeah. Here it is. This is the same menu. Yeah, because we don't have fresh-squeezed juice. [Imitating foreign accent] Fresh-squeezed juice is stupid. That is not how I talk at all. Yes, it is. So it Capoeira. It's stupid, ok? Tina: Dad, stop. Jairo: Oh, hello, Tina. I didn't notice you. That's ok. Is everything all right with you, Tina? My dad won't let me train anymore. Tina... What? It's because you made him poop in his pants. Oh, my God. Tina! Bob, please. There is nothing to be embarrassed about. It is quite common for a wounded animal to make a bowel movement as he is defeated by a much stronger predator. Hey, it wasn't you. It was 4:30. Here, Bob. Let me show you some very convenient sphincter-tightening exercises. No, thank you. Tight. Relax. I don't want... Tight. Relax. Stop it! Tight. Don't do sphincter-tightening exercises in my restaurant. Ok. Fine. Thank you. Gene: I'll be feeling this in the morning. Hoo! Bob: Gene! Well, now my stomach is full of negative energy, so I've lost my appetite, which is just as well. It's time for me to go to class. Tina, you should come with me. Remember, the troca de cordoes is next week. The troca de cordoes? What's the troca de cordoes? I feel if Tina trains hard, she has the potential to receive a promotion to yellow cord. Tina, listen to me. You're not going anywhere. I'm your father. Yes, Tina... But I am your Capoeira instructor. Wait. I'm going to class with you. Tina, what are you doing? Dad, you don't understand. I understand you're grounded, effective right no. Bob, let her go. No. She's grounded, Lin. We all just need a minute to calm down. Hey, Tina, you walk out that door, and you're no longer my grill cook. Dad. Calm down. I'll go get her. You get out of here! You hear me? Never look back! You are dead to us. Sorry, dad. There's no getting through to that one. Thanks, Louise. That was very helpful. Big day. Mm-hmm. Big, big day. Hmm... The troca de cordios. I know. I know it's the troca de cordios. I told you, I'm not going. Ok. Fine. I'm just gonna say one more time, I think that you should come support your daughter. Linda, I just grounded her. You let her go. Bob, I'm sorry. Ok. Come on. It's just a phase. I know you're afraid your gonna lose your little girl. That's sweet, but what'd you think, she's gonna spend the rest of her life standing next to you grilling burgers? Ha ha! Ha ha! Ha ha! Ha ha! Ha ha! Ha ha! Ha ha! Ha ha! Ha ha! Ha ha! Ha ha! Ha ha! That's silly, spending the rest of her life standing next to me grilling burgers. Of course not. I mean, nothing wrong with it. I mean, it would be fun.  Tinarine, tinarine, cha cha cha, tinarine  Tina, Tina, Tina, Tina, tinarine!  We're ready. Ok. I'm coming. I'm sorry, Tina. I'm not going. I love this restaurant. You can't abandon the things you love just because of sexy dance fighting. If I were a hamburger, you'd come watch me fight. Good job, Bob. Gene, Louise, come on. We're going to Tina's karate concert. So you're not going to get revenge today? No, Louise. I'm not. Ok. Got it. Then I won't bring your credit card, which I cut into a ninja star. Oh, you cut my credit card? Into a ninja star.  Tambourine, tambourine  ninja star, credit card, tambourine  Family drama at Bob's burgers, huh? Bob. Bob. Bobby. What, Teddy? What's a troca de cordoes? It's a ceremony. It's like a graduation. Oh. Yeah, but this guy is a creep, and I got to stand my ground. She made a commitment to this restaurant, period. "Exchange of strands." What? I just looked up troca de cordoes. It's portuguese for "exchange of strands." Sounds momentous. This very day, she's becoming a woman, exchanging her strands. Wait. That's what it says? Yeah. That's what it says. It says she's becoming a woman? Well, yeah. Take a look. What you gonna do about it, Bob? Doesn't say becoming a woman. No. Read into it. It says, "exchange of strands." It's exchanging strands. Has nothing about her becoming a woman. What are you saying, Bob? What are you saying, Teddy? Just, if my daughter was becoming a woman, I would want to be there. She's not becoming a woman, Teddy. No, but if she was, I'm saying. She's not my daughter. You were the one who just said it again. Get out. Get out, Teddy. I want to pay my bill! Get out of my restaurant! I want to pay my bill. There's your bill... $4.16, pervert. $4... pervert? Pervert? Pervert. Who you calling pervert? It's written on the bill. Here's your $4.16, Bob. Best of luck. There's a million restaurants I can go to. Then go to them all, Teddy! I'm sorry, Teddy. I get carried away. No. I blew my stack. I'm sorry. It's just, she's growing up so fast. Also, I crapped my pants yesterday. Yeah. I know. I heard. Ha ha! Listen. I got to close up shop. I have somewhere to be. So you really do have to get out. Sha! Uh...Ah... Sha! Brazil. That's my son. Sha! Sha! Oh, God. Brazil! Sha! Sha! Sha! And I'm a... Brazil. Finished. Congratulations, Neil. You have earned your yellow cord. [Applause] Tina, you're next. All right! Go, Tina! You're doing great. Hyah! Sa! Hyah! Mm. Mm. So glad you came, Bobby. She looks like she's having a good time. Sa! Sha! Mm. Mm. Hyah! Brazil! Mm! Thank you. The test is complete. I'm sorry, Tina, but you have failed. Have a seat. The next student testing for her yellow corda is janelle. Hey, hey, hey, hey, wait, wait. Wait a minute. Wait. Please do not interrupt the ceremony, Bob. Just give her the stupid cord. Can't you see how much this means to her? I'm sorry, Bob, but she did not perform the 5 elementary motions, so she will not be receiving her yellow corda. What? She did better than Neil. That kid was a mess out there. What? Hey! Oh, you know it's true. Tina did all 5 of the elementary weird motions, I think. She did that one. She did that one a lot. Is this because I made you poop your pantalones? This isn't about me. It's about Tina. Oh, is that what you think? All right. That's it. I'm taking a corda. Ow! Don't touch. Ponytail! Stop that. Make me.  Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight  Nose bone! Nose bone into the brain and skin him and wear him like a costume. All right, Louise. All right. All right. Here we go. Bobby, don't do this. I have to stand up for Tina. But, Bob, look at the clock. It's 4:28. I know, Lin. I know, and if I poop, I poop. Oh, Bobby...  Jairo, jairo, jairo, jairo, jairo...  Sha! Heh heh heh. Hold on. I wasn't ready that time, so... Brazil! Ponytail! Ow! Keep your sphincter tight, Bobby. I'm ok, Lin. Use this, dad. Ow! Louise... Ponytail! Ow! Oh! Brazil! Uh! Huh! Hey, you want some more? Um... Hyah! Ow! Make him stop, mom. Brazil! Uh! Tina, voice-over: Dad was right. Jairo is just a jerk... a sexy, sensual, creepy, sexy jerk. Go, dad! Come on.  Dad, dad...  dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad...  Thanks, Tina. I got him right where I want him. Ow. Sha! Ow! Enough. Ow! Bob: Hey, nice form. Thanks. Sorry jairo knocked you down 25 to 30 times in front of everyone. Yeah. Sorry I couldn't get your yellow corda. It's ok. Thanks for getting beat up for me. Anyway, I'm kind of interested in russian kettleball strength training now. Don't make me watch this because I... I'll show mom. Yeah. Well, I have a surprise for you. You got a promotion. Really? I get a raise? No... But you get these yellow dish gloves. I present to you your yellow gloves. So much fun. Well, we better get going. Yeah. That dead seal down at the pier isn't gonna poke itself. Wait, wait. Hold on. You two are working today. What? We're not on the schedule today. Read. Learn how to read the schedule that you write. Tina, honey, we're giving you the day off. Go do something fun. Do you know where this dead seal is? What's that about? Its a dead seal, mom. It's... a washed-up seal. They go poke at it. And we're gonna slap it. It makes a great sound. Then I sample the slaps. Sounds like an orgy. I like dead seals, but I think I'm gonna stay here instead. I'm actually having fun at work today. Besides, it's our father-daughter time. Aww! Sucker! Gene, run. Run, run, run, run, run to the seal!
[Sizzling] Bachelorette party! All right! Going to the strip club. All right. Going to pickles. Boy, am I gonna need some quarters tonight. Ha ha! Quarters? Yeah. What are you gonna do with quarters, lin? I'll plop them in their g-strings. You'll plop quarters in their g-strings. Plop them right in. Flippity flop. At pickles. Pickles. Why do they call it pickles? They actually serve pickles. Hmm. No. I'm not kidding. They really have good pickles. You think they wouldn't, but they're delicious. You're going to dinner theater, aren't you? Ha ha ha! What? What do you mean? Why, that's crazy. Fine, Bob. You got me. I know you don't approve of dinner theater, so I fibbed. You know what? I'd rather you go to a strip club. Gene: What do you have against dinner theater, dad? Well, first of all, gene, it's neither dinner nor theater. It's like the imitation cheese of theater. Sounds fun. Imitation cheese is delicious. That's my boy. That's my star. Linda, you know what the real problem is? What? It's the result of dinner theater, what it does to you, makes you sing everything. Who was that?  Wrong number  Oh. Yeah. So what's for breakfast?  Eggs, eggs, eggs, bom bom  eggs, eggs, eggs, eggs  Oh, my God.  bom bomp  So, lin, it's... all right.  Not tonight, no  ok.  Not tonight, no  I get it.  And so you're gonna be doing that all week, right?  No  Yeah! Ha ha ha! Man:  we drink, we loot, we r*pe, we sh**t  Different man:  we sing, we dance, we twirl, we prance  All:  we're the pirates of panache  panache  Linda, tell me everything. Oh, mort, I'm telling you, to be in dinner theater... if I could do my life over again, oh, if I could just have one chance... you'd do that? Yeah. Linda, what are you talking about? You've got a great life. You work in a restaurant. You get to feed the world, right? Right. There was someone in here from Canada last week, remember, and we learned all about that country. It's great. I hate that country. You know, Linda, you've got the dinner part already. You know what that means. You're halfway to doing... Yeah? Your own... Say it. Yeah. Say it. What? What? Dinner theater. Your very own dinner theater. Dinner theater. Yes! Yeah! Yay! Why are we excited? Hamburger dinner theater? Oh, come on, Bobby? We work hard every day to make your dream come true. Why can't we do my dream, too? About how long do you think your dream will take, like an hour, hour and a half? You crazy? It's got to be at least a 3-week engagement. 3 weeks? How about 3 days? All right. We'll take it. Ha ha! This is gonna be wonderful. What's the show gonna be? Ah, m*rder. m*rder mystery. Ach. How about mass m*rder mystery? Ok. Sure. And a musical? Of course. Can it also be a love story? Aw, a mass m*rder mystery musical love story set in... n*zi* Germany. Oh, in Montreal. Enough with Canada! In a ketchup factory, a sexy ketchup factory? [Wheeze wheeze] I got it! In a morgue! I have props. Oh, come on. Yes. Yes. Mort, that's it. We'll call it "Dreamatorium. " Really?  Dreamatorium  it's a dreamatorium  Ugh.  bom bomp  Look at this set. Am I in a morgue? Oh, it feels like I am. I am just so happy we've all been bitten by the dinner theater bug. Now, gene, you're on sound effects, naturally. Gene's voice: Aah! Ominous. Chills. Oh. Remember, every character gets some intro and outro music. You got it. [Plays "Mysterioso pizzicato"] Don't. Don't score me. Mort, you're on visual effects. Fake blood... Or is it? Now, script. As you know, everyone who enters my morgue is mysteriously k*lled. Mort... body delivery guy, victim one; Gene... flower delivery guy, victim two; Tina... tree, victim 3; Louise... the Butler who everyone thinks is the k*ller. You're the red herring. Tina is a tree that gets k*lled? She wants to be a tree, she can be a tree. Tina has got stage fright. I have stage fright? Yeah, sweetie, ever since you were a little baby. Tina, say, "mommy." Mommy. Uh... Ma. No. Uh. I'll keep cutting. You say when. Uh... Uh. Uh. Woman on phone: 911. What's your emergency? Uh... Tina! Help! Uh... Hello? Tina! Fire! Uh... That explains a lot. Now, Bobby, there's a small part I'd like you to play... the tree surgeon who tries to save the tree but instead becomes victim number 4. I'd love to, but absolutely not. I'm already doing the dinner part of this dinner theater, lin, by myself, I might add. It's one line. No. What's the matter? Afraid you might get bitten? Bzz bzz bzz! Gotcha! Ha ha! Yeah. Ok. Good. Let's do a scene right now. Come on. Let's do an improv. An improv? Yeah, an improv. I... hi. What's your... hi. How are you? I'm just standing out here. So am I. It's cold out. Not really. Uh... I have a big coat on. See? You're good. You're good. That was good. I don't like it. I don't like it. Yes. That was a whole scene. It just becomes a play. I love that. That's the play we should do. We'll call it "big coat." Red leather, yellow leather. Red leather, yellow leather. Um, are you taking to me? I'm warming up my instrument! Unbelievable! I'm sor... uh... Hey, I'm sorry. It's preshow nerves. Come here. Hug for luck. You freaking idiot! You don't hug for luck in the theater! Uh... Shh shh shh. Shh shh. I'm sorry, baby. Shh shh. I didn't mean it, baby. You know how I get before a big show. You know how I get. Get off of me! You're smudging my makeup! You want me to go out there in front of these people with this makeup all smudged, you clumsy oaf! Sorry, baby. Come here. [Playing upbeat music] Good evening, ladies. Please enter and be tained. Teddy: I don't get it, Bob. Why are people buying tickets to your burger? Linda is putting on a dinner theater, so you're paying for the entertainment plus the burger. What if someone only wants to eat a hamburger? I guess you could just pay for the burger and turn your back to the stage. I could kind of watch like this, you know, with my peripheral vision. It'd be the honor system, Teddy. I mean, if you find yourself watching the show, you should probably buy a ticket, right? Oh, that's fair. That's more than fair. Shh, but, Teddy, you can't talk during the show. No, no, no. I get it. One time I was at the movies, right, Teddy! Shh! And this guy's phone goes off during... Teddy, they're starting. [Whispering] And this guy's phone goes off... Don't tell the story, Teddy. And he picks up the phone... Don't tell... shh! And everyone in the theater is like, "stop it"... Teddy, stop. Stop telling... and everyone is like, "who's the k*ller?" Shut your mouth. Right. No. That's what that guy did. Shut your mouth. Linda: Ahem! Everything dies...  But love  Good evening. This is the story of love, but there will be a m*rder*r, and it's up to you to guess who that m*rder*r is. Hint... it's not me... Because I'm just Gladys, a lonely morgue owner. You know, they say most people find love where they work. Well, look where I work. Corpse delivery for a lonely morgue owner.  That would be me  Mort: Waagh! I've been m*rder*d to d*ath. Aah! Aah! Aah! So no actual m*rder tonight, just a lot of fake blood and fake organs. Yeah. Right. Right. Fake. Yeah. We might have overdone it a little on the Gore. Well, no harm done. Except for the people being treated for shock. Yeah, and the people who demanded their money back. Eh. Well, the next performance is gonna be really great. Next performance? Wasn't tonight's debacle the end of dinner theater? I just need to tweak some stuff for tomorrow's show, maybe tone down the blood a smidge. What? I've been thinking. I want to get over this stage fright. I think I'd like to have a line. Aw, Bob, our tree is growing up and sprouting words. Let's write you a speech for tomorrow night's performance. Can I say, "no. Don't"? That's exactly what a tree would say. I'll have it memorized by tomorrow night. Lin, you lived out your dream on stage for a couple minutes, and since there were no charges filed, they can never take that away from you, right? Bob, my dream has not been...  satisfied  The show must go on, dad. Yeah. Did you give up after you made your first burger? It ain't over till it's over. No. You added garlic powder. Luck is 90% preparation and... gene, enough. Oh, two more shows. This tastes nothing like real blood. Flowers for a lonely morgue owner.  That's me  Oh, God! That feels like a sharp knife in my belly. Ohh! Aagh! Aagh! Arrgh! Psst, gene. Aagh! Agh! Agh! Gene. Gene. Yeah? Uh-huh? Are you done? No. I need you to serve this to table 3. Linda: Bob, shh! He's dying. Stop. I'm sorry. Come on... ahem. Come on, Butler. Let's go out into the garden. Uh... Tina. Tina, it's your big line. Uh... Go. No. Don't. The tree, it's been m*rder*d. Oh, Butler, who is committing all these murders? Beats me. Oh, there's my knife. Well, I sure don't know whodunit. Do you? Is the tree the m*rder*r, or is the flower delivery man the m*rder*r, or perhaps the suspicious Butler. [Applause] Well, you're all wrong.  The m*rder*r was me  ha ha!  What? You explicitly told us at the beginning of the show you weren't the m*rder*r. That's right. It's a twist. No. It's a lie. A lie is not a twist. Don't be nervous. You do this all the time. The cast will be signing autographs if anyone would like one. Everyone back in their seat! Now! This is a robbery. [Plays chord] A robbery. Now, that's a twist. This is not part of the show, people. This is a real robbery. Kids, get behind the counter. We can take this guy. I go high. You go low. Wait. What? Never mind. Never mind. Wait. You blew it. You blew it, Tina. All right. Stay where you are. Give me everything in the register. Yeah. Fine. Listen. There are kids here, so don't do anything stupid...Er than rob this place. Shut up, greaseball. Don't call me greaseball... Uh, mask face. [Laughter] It's not part of the show. Show? [Organ playing chords] Gene, stop. Just take it easy. Oh, I'll take it...Easy. Hmm, they added a robbery element to the show. That's clever. The ski mask is a little cheesy. I think it looks pretty good. Ok. That's all of it. You've got your money. Now be on your way. Give me a little music. Oh, come on. Just go.  Ooh da eh ooh  do your last line again  go    You've got your money. Now be on your way.  Maybe I'll leave, and maybe I'll stay  maybe it's the limelight  could be the singing  911 should be a-ringing  but I can't stop  and neither can I  [Applause] Sit down. Sit down! I'm kidding. Everyone up. Come on. It's not part of the show. Play me out. [Playing upbeat music] Can you break a 5? I'd love to tip out the cast. No! I can't break a 5, lady! I was just robbed! Did you not just see that? You were standing right here, idiot! Oh, you people commit. Get out! We feel terrible we didn't stop that robbery last night. Oh, that robbery was horrible. Ohh! Though I have to admit, it felt so good to hear the audience applaud. Are you guys talking about that show last night? I thought it was dazzling. Oh, yeah? You saw "dreamatorium"? Yeah. I caught the end of it. I thought the guy who played the robber really stole the show. Is that why you guys are here? No. They're here because the robber was a real robber and he stole 227 bucks. A little less than that. It'll be hard to catch this guy. Nobody got a good look at him. Put this down in your report. He was leading-man handsome. He was wearing a ski mask. Well, he had the presence of a young Burt Reynolds. And the pipes of an old Debbie Reynolds. Hey, the on-line reviews are in. Listen to this one. It's from hoosierdaddy1997. "The plot made zero sense, and the set looked like children made it..." Yeah. Children did make it... my children. "But the reason to go see "dreamatorium" "is the closing musical number. "The chemistry between the robber character and the lonely morgue operator was sparktastic." Did anyone mention the food? Uh...No. Great. So the robbery got rave reviews. Bob, we're a hit. No, Linda. We were hit. Good one. Yeah. That's good. Hey, thanks. I don't get it. We were hit. A hit is... am I wrong? ... Is a robbery, right? Right. A hit is a robbery. Well, technically, for the cops... technically, no. It's not... Forget it. Forget it. But in layman's terms... forget it, everybody. Nobody got hit. Everybody forget it. There we were, putting on the show of our lives, when in walked a man with a g*n in his hand, and he was looking for you know who. We will now take questions. Oh! Me. Oh! Oh! Large Tommy. Question for Tina. Were you scared? Um, uh... No. She wasn't. Oh! Oh! Normal-size Jenny. How big was the g*n, and did anyone get sh*t? That's a two-part question. I don't answer those. Aww. Tiny Peter. Does this mean you're in a gang now? That is correct. Our gang is called the broken glass kids. We'll cut you. Oh, wow. Ohh! Linda: Ach, I can wait for the show tonight. What, tonight? I thought maybe you'd consider canceling, but you're really committed to making me unhappy. The show won't be the same without the robber. What? You're all thinking it. I got to agree. That guy could really sing... And rob. Well, again, our apologies. We'll follow us as soon as we hear anything. So happy for you, though. Thanks. Ahh... Mort, you're right. What am I gonna do without the robber? You'll just have to...  Take it easy  Wait a minute. That voice. Oh, my God, it's you. You're the robber. Guilty. Last night was something, wasn't it? Oh, I know. We were electric together. So let's do it again tonight. Yes. I want to report a... what are you doing, Linda? I'm getting this guy arrested. No, but he wants to do the show again. He robbed us with a g*n. Hey, everyone relax. It wasn't even a real g*n... fake and currently in my other jacket locked in the trunk of my car. Bob, he wants to perform. This guy is the missing ingredient to my show. He's my garlic powder. Yes. The man who robbed my restaurant is here right now. He's about 5'8", maybe 150 pounds. I'm bad at guessing weight, though, so... yeah. I'll say. Yeah. 160? Oh, flatterer. All right. 170. Ooh! Aah! Call you back. You said the g*n was in your car. I lied. What about it being fake? Also a lie. See? A lie can be a twist. Since you did that, I'm gonna do this. Register. Oh, great. Again. Good luck tonight without me. We forgot to give this to you... a little "sorry we let the robber get away" bundt cake. You're doing it again. He just ran right past you. Hold that thought, Bob. The guy who robbed us just robbed us again. Hold on. Can you repeat that, dispatch? He's saying what I'm saying. The guy who robbed us, he just left. We got to go, Bob. The guy who robbed you was just spotted in the area. Don't catch him. Don't catch him. Don't catch him. Don't catch him. Ah, they got him. Bob: Jeez, that Julia packs a wallop. Ah, you couldn't just let me have my dream, could you? What? You mean, because I called the police? The guy committed armed robbery, lin, twice. But you committed m*rder, Bob. You blew my dream's head off. That's a little dramatic, lin. Yes, Bob, because I used to be an actor. Only two tickets left for "dreamatorium," the show over 3 people have been blogging about. Final performance, people. Do you think you're gonna say your line tonight? Probably not. You know, a good way to beat the stage fright... imagine the audience naked. I already do that. I imagine everyone naked. Everyone? All the time? Yeah. You don't do that? No. Oh. Well, try picturing the audience with clothes on, then. Like all their clothes? Well, maybe just a condom and a hat. Ok. Tonight's show is officially sold out, packed house. Are you feeling it, mom? Whoo! Are you feeling it, dad? Whoo! Eh, who cares? The audience is expecting to be dazzled, but thanks to your father, we have no star. Let's just go do the version everyone hated. Whodunit? Was the m*rder*r the corpse delivery guy, or was it the flower delivery guy, or was the m*rder*r the shifty Butler? [Applause] Wrong. The m*rder*r was me. Thank you. Good night. Hold on. I saw the show last night. Trust me, it's about to get good. That's our show, everyone. Thanks for coming out. What about the you-know-who surprise performer? Yeah. Well, the show is what it is, so... good night. I'll tell you what it is. It's garbage. Linda: Ok. All right, then. Drive safe. Bob: Nobody move! This is a robbery! I said, sit back down, lady, or I'll sh**t! Aw, Bobby, you're in the show. Garbage. I don't want your money. I just want the money of the big sh*t who owns this place. Ooh, way to commit, honey. Boy, I thought we did better today. Oh, well... ahem. All right. Here it goes.  So I'm singing words to a song  I'm making up right now  'cause it's the singing that matters  and not the song  so it's up to me...  to...  sing...  in...  key  Ow! Ow!  Key  ey  ey  That was great. Yeah. Just go... what? It's a little high. Well, I nailed it. You were a little high. So you go higher. I think... everyone is gone. Yeah. I think we can stop. We cleared them out. No. Don't. I did it. Tina, take a bow, girl. ["C'mon, get happy" playing]
(Audience murmuring) Shh! Bob! Hey! Whoo! (Whistles) Bob! Hey, I think you missed a spot! Oh, never mind. That's just your mustache! (Laughing) Ka-boom! Ha-ha. Ha-ha, Jimmy! Good one. Uh, at least I could grow one. You can't! Gene? Louise? How about a "ka-boom"? You can do better than that, dad. Yeah, step it up. Okay, you do better. Give me something. How about, I don't know... Nice shoes, Jimmy. Do they make them for men, too? Ha! That's, uh... that's good. Hey, Ji... Oh. They're gone. God, I hate Jimmy Pesto with his crappy food and all his... customers. Oh, forget about your silly rivalry for one minute. Bob, listen, come here. Tina's birthday's coming up, and I think we should do something special since she's turning 13. This is the year she becomes a woman. Yeah, I don't want to hear this. Bob, she deserves a special party this year. If what it says in her diary is true, then I'd say she needs it. A lot. It's true. Wait. You read her diary? Yeah. What I can stomach. I just skim it to make sure she's not on drugs. What... what does it say? It says, "I'm not on drugs." It's pretty rough. But she thinks things will really turn around this year. Yeah, she dubbed it the "year of Tina." Why is everyone reading her diary? It's well-written. She's better on the page than in person. And what if the Nazis get us, and it's all we have of our family? Okay, fine. We'll make this birthday extra-special. All right. Tina, sweetie, come here. Yeah? Listen, baby, we'd like you to have and extra-special 13th birthday party. So take your time, and think about what would make the perfect party. I'd like it to be a boy-girl party. Mm-hmm. Mm. With mingling. I want to close the restaurant and invite my whole class over. No. And I want there to be a dj, and dancing, and a smoke machine, mmm-mm. And about two hours into the party, I want there to be a moment where I see Jimmy Jr. Across the room hmm. And we're pulled toward each other. Mmm-mm. We meet under the disco ball, mm. And we kiss until our bodies and souls become one. Oh, God. And it's my first kiss. Mm. And it's perfect, and I remember it forever. Freak. Scary. Wow. You've really put some thought into it. That, uh, sounds expensive. And I could do without the kissing Pesto's kid part. Oh. It's okay, I guess I wasn't meant to have a good life. Bob, a word? Now? Not now. Now. All right. You want to kiss Jimmy Pesto Jr.? Yes. A lot. Many times. I can help you. I'll be your kissing coordinator. It's my birthday present to you. Yeah, I think I know how to kiss. Ow! Do ya? You think you know how to kiss? You know how to lock lips, huh? Do ya? Ow! You think you know what it feels like to kiss a man, Tina?! If you don't know what you're doing out there, you could get yourself k*lled. Or worse! Ow, ow! STDS, Tina, have you heard of them? Have you heard of herpes? Have you? Yes. Yes. Do you know what herpes feels like on your mouth? Yes. What? What is it? What? Like, um, cuts on your mouth. That sounds right. Sla... I'm gonna slap gene. Ow! Closing down the restaurant, getting a smoke machine, and a dj? That's gonna add up. We have nothing extra this month, lin. Well, we got to do what we got to do. Look at her. Bob: She's so awkward. She's a good girl. Okay. I'll talk to Fischoeder about getting an extension on the rent. (Horn blowing) It's foggy. Yes, it is. Are you there? I am. (Exhales sharply) Why are we here in the fog? I-I wanted to meet you, and then you told me to meet you here. Oh, that's right. It was a good idea. I love the fog. Listen, Mr. Fischoeder, I know we talked about never doing this again, but if you can just give us two extra weeks this month on the rent... I'm going to have to stop you right there, Bob. Were-were you going to follow that up with anything? No. Oh. Oh, I love the way the fog feels under my cape. Uh, right. I'll get going. Bob, listen. What do you think of this? What if I don't give you an extension on your rent, but I do give you the opportunity to earn some extra money in one of my side businesses? That sounds... Sketchy. Oh, it is, Bob. Oh. But you get to wear this hat. Oh! So, for the next week, I'll be driving a taxicab to pay for Tina's party. And I'll be wearing this hat. Cool! Cool! Cool hat or job? Job. Hat. Thank you, dad. This party is gonna sizzle. (Imitates sizzling) Stop it. Wait, wait. Bob, Bobby. Yes? When are you going to have time to drive a cab? Well, I'll work the full day at the restaurant, lin, then I'll go drive the cab from 10:00 P.M. To 6:00 A.M. Aww, Bob. All right, all right. Wait. Why do you have to wear a hat? Just let this be fun for me. Dad, you won't regret this. When I kiss Jimmy Jr. Under the disco ball, it'll be like we're all kissing Jimmy Jr. Under the disco ball. I call first. Really? Well, if I'm gonna kiss him, I don't want to go after you guys. I'll go last. I'm fine with that. We're not kissing Jimmy Jr. Yes, we are! That's ten pieces of gum, Tina. Chew! Chew! A kiss is like a fight with mouths. And... time. Spit. I'm going to destroy this kiss. (Moaning, grunts) Ow! Not yet. There's my Johnny two-jobs. Making money for the dream birthday party. (Groans) Okay. Off into the night I go. Bobby, be safe out there. And make chitchat. You'll get more tips. Yeah, and keep the meter running. Watch out for pukers. And stay away from route one. It's bumper-to-bumper all the way to the interstate. Tina, how did you know that? I like traffic updates. Why? I like when they say "bumper-to-bumper." "Bumper-to-bumper"? (Sighs) Wow. Yeah. Uh, bye. (Grunts) Stupid beaded seat cover. Ooh, okay. I get it. Fm. Nice. Hey, guess what? You're my first fare. Oh, no! No. Oh. (Vomiting continues) (Gagging) Uh, where to, ladies? Fourth and ocean, doll. Thanks for stopping. Most cabbies are too prudish to pick us up. (Chuckles) And, uh, that's because you are...? Fabulous! (All laughing) That's true. Well... You're clearly fabulous. Yeah. Yes. Hey, eyes on the road, mister. Yeah, stop staring at us. This ain't no library. Don't fall in love, Mr. cabdriver. You can't afford us. Hey, who's picking up who here? (Chuckling) Hey. Don't worry, ladies. I'm-I'm kidding. I'm, uh, I'm a married man. So am I. (Bob laughing) Bob: Oh. Now, Tina, anyone can tie a cherry stem with their tongue. Let's see what you can do with this banana peel. Get-get it in there. (Groans) Bobby! Good morning. You're home. Yeah. Guess who learned a lot about transvestites last night. I was only on that web site for, like, two seconds. What? No. I was talking about me. I picked up a group of tr*nsv*stite hookers who showed me a side of this town I never knew existed. And, gene, you're banned from the computer for two days. After what I saw, I'm-I'm fine with that. (Muffled): What's a tr*nsv*stite hooker? Bob, I'm not sure this is appropriate breakfast conversation. (Yawning): I guess you're right. Maybe I should just try and go to sleep. Uh... (Snoring) Gene, honey, I think he's sleeping. I have to go to school. Shh, shh. Just hold still. Ew. Is this drool or sweat? It's both. Your father is a very moist sleeper. (Groans) Aw, look at my two boys. (Gags) Nice. Oh, a bow. Let's put that on dad's head. There's your tr*nsv*stite. Get the camera. I'm having a birthday party this Saturday. It's co-ed. Because I'm becoming a woman. Co-ed? My hands just got clammy. Hey, Jimmy Jr. Hi, Tina. This is an invitation to my birthday party. Hey, I notice you haven't RSVP'd to my party yet. Um, I need to ask my dad for permission. Can I let you know later? Sure, okay. Butt.  Across 110th street  pimps trying to catch a woman that's weak  across 110th street  pushers won't let the junkie go free  across 110th street...    Oh, how you holding up, Bob? Good. I mean, I'm tired. And, um, I might be a pimp. You're gonna need a bigger hat. Well, you're still father of the year. Hmm. Tina's party's gonna be amazing. I got a disco ball and streamers. It's gonna be like Buckingham Palace. Yeah, yeah. Studio 54. (Laughing) Those are two very different examples. Well, you get the idea. You know. It's a party. So, is Tina happy? Uh, she'll be happier once Jimmy Jr. RSVPs. She's over at Pesto's right now to see if he'll come. I told her to show some skin. (Tina sobbing) So, how'd it go? Jimmy Jr. isn't coming to my birthday party even though he wants to because his dad won't let him. All because our dads hate each other. Oh. Sorry, Tina. I'll never know how soft Jimmy Jr.'s lips are. My guess is, they're pretty soft. (Groans) Like, a... Like a Kitty cat's tummy. Gene, stop. Without Jimmy Jr., I don't want to have a party. Hey. Your father's been working very hard for this party, young lady. It's going to happen. Right, Bob? (Snoring) I'll refrost it. It's still good. Mmm. Oh, it's delicious. (Muttering) Tina, honey, your father's been working his you-know-what off, driving a cab to pay for this. Yeah, and we've rented the smoke machine, so this party is definitely happening. You've been working your you-know-what off? I've been working my ass off! Night and day training! Louise, take it easy. Do you know what she was like when I started working with her? She was a sick joke! Now look at her! Gene: Incoming. Bob, you gotta go talk some sense into Jimmy Pesto. This isn't fair. Fine. Jimmy: Uh, hey, Bob. You look like crap. (Laughing) Nice. Yeah, that was funny. Look, Jimmy, my daughter Tina said that Jimmy Jr. isn't allowed to go to her birthday party. Whatever issues we have shouldn't matter. Just please let Jimmy Jr. go. Okay. Okay. You know it's going to cost you, right? Oh, God. Yeah, you see, Bob, I'm a collector of rare and exotic trophies. Well, that's pathetic. And you have something I want to add to my collection. Your mustache. Your bushy, robust, filthy eyesore of a moustache. What are you talking about? I want you to shave your mustache, and bring it over in a baggie, and I'll pin it on the wall. What? Why? As a trophy. Trophies. Well, I'm not giving you my mustache. Well, I'm not giving you Jimmy Jr. then. This is crazy, just let him go to my daughter's party. If you want a bag of hair so bad, why don't you just pick it out of the food you serve here? Ka-boom! How dare you. No 'stache, no bash. So, what'd he say, honey? Are these lips gonna see any playing time? Yeah, is Jimmy Jr. Coming to my party? No, Tina. I'm sorry, he's not. (Groans) What happened? You two couldn't work it out? No! We couldn't work it out, Linda. He said the only way he'll let Jimmy Jr. go is if I shave my mustache and give it to him. So Jimmy Jr. can come to my party? What? No, Tina. But if all you have to do is shave your mustache then he can come. Yeah, it sounds to me like you just said that Jimmy Jr. can come. That's what I heard. Done deal. I'm not shaving my mustache. It's my mustache! Hey, no, watch it. You know, Bobby, you're just as handsome without the mustache. Kind of. Uh, so that's what we should show our kids, lin-- that it's okay to negotiate with terrorists? I'd drive a cab every night for the rest of my life for my kids, but I'm not letting Jimmy Pesto humiliate me. You're the most selfish father in the world. Oh, Bob. Good night! You can't shave it, Bob. It's glorious. Oh, I miss having a mustache. Pff. Miss it? Honey, news flash... I can see it from here. You can see it from space. Stop it, cha-cha. I will thumb your eyeballs out of your skull. Ay! Hey, come on. Glitter, your... I happen to like the way your upper lip looks. Thank you, prince Valiant. Your shift's almost over, right, papi? Yea... uh, yeah it is. Why don't you join us for a beer? Yeah. Yeah. We'll throw back a few beers and smoke some crack. Crack? Just the beer, then? What is that? Ooh, your breath! I know. Bobby, listen. Hmm? All right, I talked to Tina, I told her how hard you've been working, and she agreed to come to the party tonight. For a few minutes. It's something. What party? Bob, you're delirious. Shh. You are. You're drunk. I may or may not have tried crack. Okay. Last night. I don't think I did. But if I did, I liked it. Okay, Bobby, listen, go take a nap, and I'll watch the restaurant, please. Take off your clothes. Bobby! I got to go to bed. Bobby? I don't want to do this. Stop it. Get your hands off me, sick idiot. Such a freak. Pull it together. (Groaning) I'm like an animal! Keep your voice down. I'm like king Kong! Unbelievable. I need to go to bed. Good night. Go get me special pillow. Hurry, hurry, hurry. Hey, sleepy bear. What time is it? How much longer till the party? It started a half hour ago. What? Ow! Oh. You let me sleep all day? Why didn't you wake me up? I tried. That was not the first pickle I dropped on your face. Oh. The boys hate dancing, and the girls won't ask the boys. It's a Mexican stalemate out there. Come on, boys. You're the peanut butter. Girls, you're the jelly. Let's make some sandwiches! Oh, God, why is mort doing magic? It's his gift to Tina. Uh-oh. I mean, ta-da! Bob: Whoa. Tina, you look... great. (Sighs) Maybe I can cheer her up. Louise, smoke me. (Whooping) Tina, dance with mommy. Uh, uh, uh, uh. It's a party. All right! Did someone say party? They don't go to my school. I'm sorry, ladies. We're closed for a private party. We were invited by Bob. Bob? You invited tr*nsv*stite prostitutes to our daughter's birthday party? No. Maybe. I... This week has been kind of a blur. All of you are coming to my daughter's party. We're gonna have so much fun. And bring whoever you want. (Cheering) I might have thrown it out there. Is this the sweet 13 party? Dad, you brought all your nighttime friends, but you won't shave your mustache to get me Jimmy Jr.? (Sighs) Where do I put my coat? Oh, hey, marshmallow. So, marshmallow, how'd you get your name? 'Cause if you show me a sweet potato pie, I am on top of it. I knew it! Tina, I know you're upset because Jimmy Jr.'s not here, and that there are more transvestites than you imagined, but... Unless you're Jimmy Jr., and you're here to kiss my lips, I don't want to talk to you. Come on, girl. It's your party! You might as well enjoy it. It's like I always say. When life gives you lemons... Tuck em'! Uh, I think what my girlfriend here is trying to say is, when it's time for you to blossom into a woman, you can't let anything stop you. Not a party, not a boy, and not a town full of doctors who refuse to remove your pen1s. And you have a very good father, baby. Never forget that. It's true. Not many fathers would make the sacrifices your father made to throw you this party. Working two jobs. The things he saw. The things he smelled. He deserves an award. Bob, what'd you do? You lost your nose cozy. Oh, Bob. You made yourself ugly to save Tina's party. Yes, Linda, this is why I didn't want to do it. But you know, it's worth it if it means Tina will be a happy teenager. Just stop staring. Stop! Don't do this. I... just did it. You don't need to. I don't want you to. You know how mustaches work, right? Well, don't give it to Jimmy Pesto. What about Jimmy Jr.? Jimmy Jr. isn't gonna make this party perfect. You already have. Really? I'm sorry I didn't appreciate everything you've done for me. I didn't appreciate it as a girl, but I do appreciate it as a woman. It would have been nice to hear you say that a minute ago. b*st*rd. Come and join the party, Bob. That's Jimmy Pesto, cha-cha. The guy I was telling you about. Wait. That's Jimmy Pesto?! I know that guy. We all know that guy. But we know him as baby num num. Baby num num? Wait. Pesto is one of your dates? He wishes. We run in the same circles. He's a regular over at the desire dungeon. He's what's known as a diaper-lover. You know what that is? It's nasty. (Chuckling) Jimmy Pesto is a diaper-lover? Ha, ha, ha. Hello, Bob. Well, I see I'm getting my trophy after all. Bup, bup, bup, bup. Not so fast, baby num num. (Gasps) Baby... How do you know about that? (Laughs) Hey, baby. Pesto: Oh. Hi! No. (Laughs) We just wanted to see if "wittle" baby num num... Shh. Come on. Quiet. Wanted to change his mind about letting Jimmy Jr. Go to Tina's party. Or maybe he wants the whole "westaurant" to know about... Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on. Hey! We got... Fresh pie! ... How he likes to put on... Listen, would you...? ...Diapers and poop in them.   (Gasps) I don't believe it. Thanks, dad. You're the best pimp I'm ever gonna have. I've been waiting to hear those words all my life, Tina. Happy Birthday. Bobby, come help me with the candles. Gene: This one goes out to the birthday girl. Pardon me. Birthday woman.  If you were here  I like your shirt. Are those snaps? Yes. Snap. One more. Snap. Both: Want to dance? Both: Yes. It's go time, Tina. I want his kids to have hickeys. (Fireworks popping)  But would you suspect  my emotion wandering, yeah?  I just kissed my first boy. Me, too. Oh, boo hoo. Mmm! Mmm. Hurry up and grow that thing back. I know. It's bad. Now! Concentrate! Push it out. I'm trying, lin. Oh, let me cover it with my finger. That's okay. I'm gonna glue this to my chest so I can wear v-necks. Glue it to your back! Oh, glue it to your palm.  
I'm back. What's all this? Ugh. We're renting out rooms in our apartment for the long weekend. We're gonna be a Bed & Breakfast. So exciting. I love Bed & Breakfast. They're so quaint. Aren't they? Random strangers shedding skin cells all over the house. Ugh, I'm against this Bed & Breakfast as much as you can be against something, and still, let it happen. Like when my ex-wife wanted to have a three-way with out neighbour, Ray. Teddy, Teddy. I don't think you should be talking about... Wait, you had a three-way with Ray, the guy who wears the sales suit down on the pier? Yeah. I mean I wasn't involved, I just watched. But ... yeah. I had a three-way in science class yesterday. Tammy's lab partner was absent so she joined in with me and Joey. It was fun. Okay, enough. Oilies, salties, extra-expensive toilet paper... I love that soft stuff. I thought we were doing this to make extra-money. Isn't all this eating into our profits? Don't worry, Bob. It's gonna be money and online reviews and when I die and I go to heaven. God's gonna say "Hey, aren't you the lady who rented the B&B I heard about? And I'm gonna say, "Yes, God..." "What can I get you?" Here, hold this. Mm, smell. Come on, smell it. You're shoving things in my nose. Smell this one now. You always do this, Lin. Whenever you entertain, you put way too much effort into it and drive yourself crazy. What are you talking about? I'm a wonderful hostess. No, Linda. You go overboard and then if people aren't appreciative enough, you snap. That's not true. I'm a gifted hostess and I'm ready to go pro. It is really soft. Put it back on the roll, please. But, mom, what if we just put Tina by the toilet? Yeah. I don't mind. Almost check-in time. Tina, Gene, are your rooms guest-ready? Yeah. Subjective. Remember when you made fun of me for moving into a closet? Well now you suckers have to give up your room and I don't. A guest! Javi...is an entomologist. Javed. My name is Javed. What? Alright. What kind of doctor is an entomologist again? Glands, butt? Ha, I'm not a butt doctor. I study insects, specifically the mating habit of the myfungal beetle. Oh. So what brings you here? Myfungal beetles feed on fungus, and this town has a very, very high potency of fungus. Uh, that's actually our town motto. Fungus town! Tina, why don't you show Javeeed... His room... Javed. Jav-ed? Javed. You'll be in the equestrian suite! Huh? Okay. That's great... he brought a bug in a jar into our house. (Whispers): Don't be r*c1st! I decorated it myself. You... Like horses a lot. You like jars. Oh, these are specimen jars... I intend to mate the queen with a male and preserve her eggs. You mean you're gonna watch beetles have s*x with each other? Mm-hmm. Cool. What's that for? Ooh, this is a synthetic pheromone. It's similar to what the queen emits when she wants to attract males. (Sniffs) Does it work on human boys? Oh, no. Well, maybe. Ah... (Coughing) May I store these in the bathroom? Sure. Everyone would love that. (Doorbell rings) More guests! Welcome! You must be ed and Nora Samuels! Yes. Hello. Hi. Come on, come in. I'll give you the tour. Okay, this is the salon. This is where we're gonna have the meet-and-greet, and you're just in time! Uh... Actually, we'd just like to go to our room, if that's okay? Right. We'd just like to get settled. (Laughs) What? Why? Stay here for the meet-and-greet. Maybe we'll come back out in a bit. No, stay. It's gonna be fun. Tina, get Javeed! I think he's napping. Wake him up! So, let's go around and we'll, um, we'll play a little game. Let's say what our most embarrassing moment was. Who wants to go? I'll go. One time I coughed at communion, and the wafer flew right out of my mouth and it landed on my boob! (Laughs) Who wants to go next? Javed? I'll take a pass. Get me on the next one. What about when dad got a perm? It wasn't a perm; It was a body wave. You looked like Barbra Streisand in the main event. You looked like Barbra Streisand's pubes. I did. How about how dad says gracias in Mexican restaurants? That's embarrassing. Remember the time you asked me to check your prostate and you made a poopie? Linda! Oh, remember when dad tried to go jogging? (Others laughing) (Laughter becomes hysterical) Oh, come on! What about when dad cried at the end of about Schmidt? Gene, why are you in your underwear? I was eating. What, you want me to get butter all over my clothes? Yeah. Now we just take him out back and hose him off. You're a doctor... is this a mole? I'm not a doctor. And that's a raisin. Oh... edible mole. (Laughs) All right, let's let someone else go. Samuels, how about you, what's your most embarrassing moment? I don't know. This? Yeah, definitely this. Hm. (Clears throat) Are we done? Yes, I guess we are done, Nora. (Whispers): Are you sure there aren't any rooms available anywhere else? (Whispers): No, everything's booked... I checked. Ooh, hello. (Chuckles) Hm. I'm cold. My nipples are so pointy! Ding-dong! It's for you. Mm-mm. Mm-mm. (Singsongy) Mm-hmm... Mm-mm. It might be a package... You should answer it. (Singing lively melody) Yecch! Lin, stop stewing and go to sleep. I can't help it, Bob! Our guests are such party poopers. All of 'em! No one has any b&b spirit at all! (Groans) Okay, just go to sleep, all right? You'll feel better in the morning. Fine! Gene, gene, your foot is down the back of my underwear. It's warm down there... My feet are cold. Yes, but it's my ass. Mm. Dad, are you still awake? Yes, Tina. I was just talking to Gene, right? A second ago? Do you think horses get songs stuck in their heads? Oh, my God. I don't know. Tina, go to sleep. Dad, do you want any chicken? Don't tell anyone... There's just enough for the two of us. Just go to sleep, all of you. I'm glad our guests are comfortable, Linda, 'cause this is great! Oh! Our guests! They'll appreciate me. I'll just have to try harder next time. (Grunting) Hey! (Whispers): I've got a backup. Bob: I've never been so happy to be at work. Yeah, you opened early today, huh, Bob? Well, there was a line to get into the bathroom up in the apartment, so I came down here to do my morning routine in the slop sink. (Humming a tune) (Humming a tune) Whoo! (Chuckles) Whoo! Bob, do we have any toothpicks down here? Yeah, over there. Pretty ones? What do you mean, pretty ones, Lin? The nice ones. How's the b&b going, Linda? Oh, it's great! Why? What'd you hear? What? Nothing. I bet it's magical up there. I picture it like england. It is, Teddy, it is. But do they appreciate it? Holed up in their rooms like dirty little gophers? Why come to a b&b if you're not gonna participate, you know? Oh, they're so ungrateful! I wish I was staying at your b&b. I'd sit in the parlor, and maybe I'd have a little wine, play some board games... Yes! Wine! Games! Teddy, you should stay here. What? You should. You're the dream guest. Really? You're the one I'm looking for? Do you have any vacancies? Yes! Louise's room! Whoa, whoa, whoa, Linda, Louise's room? She'd m*rder us. She's a big girl... She'll get over it. Linda, she won't get over it... When you vacuumed in there, she wouldn't talk to you for a week. Plus, it's not even a room; It's, like, a closet. That sounds perfect for me... I don't need a lot of room. I'll just bring, like, one outfit. Oh, I love it! I'll get my stuff. This is gonna be great! Well, have f telling Louise you're kicking her out of her room, Lin. Wear a helmet. (Humming a tune)  Ah, ha, ha...  What are you doing? Oh, hi, Louise. I was just... Oh, hi, mom. Hello. You're holding my stuff. Hello, my little lady. Hello, mom. What are you doing with my stuff? I was just welcoming our newest bed-and-breakfast guest into your room. Into my room? Say hello to Teddy! (Gasps) Hi, Louise. You got wonderful stuff in here. I love, love, love it! What? Except for this little guy; he's kind of giving me the creeps. (Quietly): This isn't happening! Mother, this isn't happening, right? Has the world gone crazy?! (Chuckles) Okay, come on, Louise. Let's leave our guest alone. You mean your guest, 'cause I did not invite Teddy to come into my room and move my stuff around! That's right. Come on. See you in a little... bit at the wine-and- cheese mixer, Teddy. Sounds good, Linda. And I'll see you in hell, Teddy. I'm sorry, Teddy. I will see you in hell! Where are the Samuels? The cheese is getting sweaty. They're in their room. I think they're jumping on the bed. I heard the box spring going crazy. Sounds like they're "busy." They should be busy eating cheese and sipping wine. What do you mean, they're busy? Like, they got homework? No. They're... it's... Busy jumping, they can't take a jumping break? Ah, Javay! You came back for the wine and cheese! You got to catch up. Chug! Chug! Chug! Whoa, look at all those males. Yes, Tina! One of these lucky bugs will mate with the queen, and then she will bite off his head. So romantic. Cheese? No, thank you. Eat it. Mm-mm. Aw, have some. Mm-mm, mm-mm. Open your mouth. Open the mouth. Mm, mm. Just try it. (Whimpers) You're gonna love it. You're gonna love it. It's really good. Gene, you're over your limit! (Retches) (Chuckles) Well, I... Hate to miss wine and cheese, but it's time for these little fellas to meet their mates. (Nervous chuckle) Bye-bye. Wait. I want to watch. Well, I'll tell you, Linda, I'm having the time of my life. You're not gonna hear me whining about it. Hey, "whine." (Laughing loudly) (Laughing) Everyone should be here for this! They don't know what they're missing! (All laughing) (Laughing): I heard the... joke from the... hallway. Do you like that, Louise? Yeah. Oh, it was...Was really funny! (Laughter dying away) Get out of my room. I'm your guest in your room... Did you talk to your mommy? It's not my mommy's room; it's my room. No, I know, and I paid $75, and I'm just going to stay in your room for a couple of nights. Louise, put some cheese in your mouth. Mmm. Mmm, isn't that delicious? Yeah, it really goes down easy, doesn't it, Teddy? Ow. (Chuckles) Just so you know, Teddy, you have one hour, then I get real. If I were a pheromone, where would I be? Aha! (Crazed laughing) (Coughing) (Hacking) (Groaning) Good night, Javee! Oh! Uh.. Good night. Crazy lady. She's a nut. Am I right? Oh, you're bad! Good night, Teddy! Good night, Linda! Sleep tight! Sleep tighter, Lin. Don't let the bed bugs bite! I won't. Hey, my pillow smells funny. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Good night, Samuels! Oh, woo! I'm sorry! I'm sorry. Hey! Oh, my God! Oh, God! Could you please close the door? Yeah. Oh, my God. Okay. Sorry. Sorry. No. With you on the other side of it. Okay. All right. All right. Leave! (Gasps) Why is Mr. Samuels wearing handcuffs? They are... They are escape artists. (Gasps) They are?! Yes. Isn't that interesting? Okay, time for bed. Let's go. All right, Louise, since you're new here, I'll show you the ropes. That corner of the bed is for eating. This right here is the exercise area. This is where I thrash. (Groaning) Yeah. I'll stand, thank you very much. (Snoring) (Groaning)   (People snoring) Here we go. Have you talked to your mommy? Why don't you talk to your mommy, Teddy? About your new roommates. Where is everybody? Careful, Bob. I reused the cheese from yesterday. Some of the omelettes have toothpicks in them. Ow. Ow. Ah. Oh, good morning, Javee! I hope you and your bugs are hungry. My appetite is gone, along with several of my specimen jars. They contained my most virile males. Oh, no. Ah, little insects with wings. How far could they go? Hey, guys. (All yelling) What? Do I have bed head? Oh, good God, Teddy. My beetles! Aah! What? Teddy, you've got beetles all over your face. Is that right? I haven't looked in the mirror yet. These males are in an extremely amorous state. You mean, right now they're trying to mate with Teddy's face? Javed: Yes. Aw. Oh, God, Ted. Does it hurt? Nope. Nope. Don't worry about it. Teddy, you should probably get to the hospital. You okay to drive? No, I don't need a hospital. I'll be fine. This is still a magical weekend. Aw. You know? He's the perfect guest. What's for breakfast? Eggs! Ugh! Nothing gets to this guy. You! I don't know how, but you did this. (Sniffing) I know how she did it. She used my pheromones on him. Okay, well, uh, Linda, everyone, have fun in the b and b. I'll be downstairs in the restaurant. Bye. Bye, dad. Bye, dad. No! You deal with her! She's out of control! Okay. Uh, give her her room back. No! Well, that's all I got. Bye. Louise! You're grounded. Go to your room. Gladly. That's all I ever wanted. No, I mean my room. Go to my room. You can't make me. Oh, yes, I can, miss Missy. I guess you can. I've never seen these beetles so aroused. I have that affect on beetles. (Laughs) I haven't had this much action in a while. Are they gonna call me tomorrow? Probably not, right? That's okay. Teddy. Making jokes, covered with bugs. You are a man! Damn you! Does anything get to you? Teddy: There's really only one thing. Gene & Tina: Yeah? Teddy: Costumed characters. You know, like the ones in amusement parks. Really? Why? It's the eyes, gene. Their cold, dead eyes. ...Watching you while they make love to your wife. While they what?! I mean... When they... uh... Go to birthday parties. Gene: All right. Thank you, Teddy. Oh, thank you, mom's purse. Well, thank you, phone. Yes, I will make a call. (Whistling) Oh, I gotcha. Oh, you're sizzling. I love your sound. Oh, hello. You have costumed characters, right? Oh, that's great. Ah, I'll take the hippo, the fox. Here's a cookie. Here's a cookie. A baby bear. And here's a cookie. And this will be credit card. (Knocking) Brought you some cookies! What's going on here? Ah, we have to go home. What are you talking about? You can't leave. You're on vacation. Sit down, enjoy the cookies, unpack your pointy bra and your whip and whip him. He's a naughty boy. I'm a naughty boy. Get to it! Did you just lock the door? She just locked the door. I... I don't know what's going on. You can come out when it's time for the ice cream social! You, too! Hey, there's my perfect guest. Hey, Linda. I got good news. I'm upgrading you to platinum status! Oh! Platinum status. That sounds fancy. It is! You hungry? You want some room service? No. Eh, I guess I can eat. I... what do you want? Uh... bacon burger? What? Bacon burger. Bacon... First-first word. Bacon. One syllable. No. Two syllables. Two syllables. Oink, oink, oink, oink, oink, oink, oink, oink! A...... pig. Dinosaur. Bacon! Bacon burger. Kevin bacon. Second word. Burger. Break pads? (Mooing) Dinosaur. Jurassic park! (Mooing) Charades! You can't guess charades. Yes, you can. Oh. Is it charades? (Mooing) Cow. Burger! Burger. Bacon burger! All right. (Cheering) Yes. Bacon burger! All right. I can do that. (Doorbell rings) Uh, doorbell. I'll get it. Oh, footloose. Can I... can I help you? Is there a Teddy here? Teddy, you've got visitors. Oh, thank you. We're the fuzzy buddies! Are you Teddy? (Gasping) What's going on here?! (Yelling) No! Someone's excited to see the fuzzy buddies. (Yelling) (Grunting) Don't... What? Whoa. You're a big bo... oh! (Teddy grunting) Oh, my God! Teddy. (Teddy crying) (Crying) It's almost the ice cream social. Linda, what is going on up here? You're losing control of your b and b. What are you talking about? Everything is going perfectly. Right. Right, Lin, everything's fine. Bob, do you have my bacon burger? Oh, yeah, the bacon burger. Here. Oh. Bob, can you help me? I can't chew. You need me to feed you? Yeah. Chew it up for him, like a mama bird. Linda, no! He's platinum status! You're crazy, Linda! It's all right, guys. I got it. Perfect guest. So let me get this straight. Teddy beat up a bunch of giant animals. You locked Louise in our room, and then you locked the guests in their rooms? They were gonna leave before the big ice cream social at 3:00. Lin, just give me the key, all right? I'm gonna let them out. No. Yes. No. Look at yourself. Look at what you've turned into! Oh, all right. All I wanted was a charming bed and breakfast, that's all. Now what am I gonna say to God when I go to heaven? Uh. (Gasps) Uh-oh. I lost the key! Oh, my God, what have I done? All right, all right, listen. You know Louise picks locks. Louise hates me. No, she doesn't hate you, Lin. I'm sure she's broken out of our room already. Oh. I'm gonna go deal with Teddy. Why don't you try her room? Okay. Hi, honey. It's mommy. Oh, hello, mother. Please do come in. Louise, I'm sorry I rented your room to Teddy and then locked you in our bedroom. I accept your apology, mom. Who among us hasn't gone a little overboard from time to time? Aw, thanks, sweetie. And you're gonna apologize to Teddy. Okay. And there's something else I need from you. (Sighs) I would just cut it up right now. Oh. No, not that. Will you please help me get Javed and the Samuels out of their rooms? I locked them in and I... I kind of lost the key. There might be something I can do. Linda: Javed, I'm sorry I locked you in your room. You're free to go if you wish. You locked me in my room? No. She's completely bonkers, isn't she? Look at me when I'm talking to you! They're gone. How did they get out of a locked room? It was their greatest escape. Look what they left behind. Look. My tongue is trapped. Now it's escaped. Now it's trapped. Now it's escaped. Hey, look! They're still climbing down. You two all right? You need any help with your bags? No. Uh, actually we're stuck. Please help us. I suppose we could get a ladder. How much did you like my b and b? A lot. Are you gonna recommend us to your friends? Yes! Are you gonna leave me your e-mail address? Ed & Nora: Yes! Get 'em the ladder. Uh, thanks for coming. Sorry. Sorry again. Ah, here's something for your trouble. Two dollars. Thanks a lot. I don't know what to tip in this situation. Yeah. Not two dollars. Oh, hey, Teddy. Ah, you all right? I think I worked through my issues, Bob. Me and the owl !Re gonna go get a drink. I'm pretty sure there's a woman inside. That's a guy, Teddy. Oh, that's a woman. The owl was a guy. It's a woman. The fox was a girl. Oh. Did the fox leave already? Yes. Oh. Linda, you are a delightful hostess. Aw, thanks, Teddy! See you at lunch, Bob. Well, that was all right. It was pretty good. I give us a b. (Groans) B plus. (Groans) A b and b plus! (Chuckles) My face is sweaty. Gene, take that off. Never! Oh! (Groaning) Oh! Ow! Ow! Aah!
(burger sizzling) (Glass breaking) Wow, I thought last year's art crawl was terrible, but they really outdid themselves this year, huh? Yeah. Ugh, bad. Very bad. Mm-hmm. Oh, look at that. Really bad. (Groans) Really, really bad. Ugh! Louise: Ugh! I think they're... good. Dad, why does art crawl suck so much? Well, it's just a very loose definition of art, Louise. And don't say suck. Don't say suck, please. You're right, though. It does suck. I don't want you kids to think this is what art is. We should go to a museum. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa. Yeah, maybe not. Yeah, we should... We should not go to a museum. Let's not overdo it. Let's just walk around and make fun of this stuff. Yeah. Okay. Why don't we just go back to the restaurant? Because your aunt Gayle is there hanging up her art, which we're not allowed to make fun of at all. Well, why can't we make fun of aunt Gayle's paintings? She's family. Yeah. That means never holding back anything, right, pit stains? Am I showing? Let's just say your shirt looks like my underwear right now. Yeah. Well, look, no one tells Gayle anything she can't handle. That's your mom's rule, all right? You treat her like a mental patient. Well, I mean, she probably should be one, right? Yeah, I heard she ate her lipstick once because she wanted to feel red inside. And she made a dress out of live shrimp and wore it to mass. Oh, and she shaved her cat. Bob: Come on, Louise. You know none of that is true. Except for the cat shaving. And maybe the shrimp and the lipstick. Are you kidding me? My kid could paint that. Tina: Wow. It costs $200. Someone bought that mess?! How rude! Harold! (Snoring) Harold?! What? There are some poorly supervised children amongst the art. Get rid of them! All right. Let's go. Keep moving. Excuse me. Are you a...? Are you a bouncer? Are you gonna bounce my kids? No, no. Just keep it moving, chubs. Chubs? You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here. (Coughs) Hey, easy, pal, all right? Don't touch. Come on, dad. This guy's not worth it. Ah, listen to your kids, fatsy. Fatsy? Come on. Come on, dad. Louise... Dad, look me... Give me your eyes, dad. Give me your eyes. Mm-hmm. Take a deep breath. You are lucky, pal. It's not worth it, dad. If you hit him, your hand would smell like ointment and pee. You smell like ointment and pee. You smell like ointment and pee. You smell like ointment and pee. You smell like ointment and pee. You... Well, that was awkward. What is that place? Louise: You don't know reflections? They sell art, not just during art crawl, but year-round. Reflections. It sounds like a strip club, the way you say it. Reflections. Mmm. So, brace yourselves for aunt Gayle's art show. Mom said aunt Gayle told her they're just adorable animals. Oh, yeah? Well, that doesn't sound so bad. (Nervous laugh) Hi, hon! How was art crawl? Hey. Huh? Everything's going great here. We're having fun. Oh, wow. Lin... Gayle's here! We hung-hung her paintings! Look at this one! Look at that one! Linda, can you just let me see...? Oh, my God! Gene: Yeah! Anuses! Oh, God. Oh, my God, lin. It's a few days, Bobby. Linda, there are animal anuses all over our walls. Just think of 'em as cute little rumps. Lin, they're anuses. I'm trying to think of worse paintings to hang in a restaurant. Um... nope, I can't think of any. Bad monkey! Kids, stop that. No. I'm spanking the monkey! No way, dad. This is the best thing that has ever happened to us. Horse butt. Oh, hello, sir. Don't look at the pictures of the anus... Yup, he already did. Okay. You see that, lin? No one wants to eat with one of those staring at them. Come on, you can't seriously think that this is a good idea. Well, they're not for me, but we promised Gayle she could display her art for the art crawl. We can't take it back now. She's fragile. We have to support her. She's not that fragile, lin. (Fork clinks) Oh! (Panting) What happened? What happened? (Panting) Gayle, Gayle honey, look, look, it's a fork. What? Look, it's a fork. Oh, it's a fork. Ha. Oh, you're k*ll*ing me. (Laughs) She's k*ll*ing me. Okay, so she's fragile. And that means we have to be the anus restaurant? Yes, it means that. Oh, we can make t-shirts! It'll say: "Milk, milk, lemonade. Around the corner art is made." Bob! Do you love 'em? Or do you just love 'em? Um, how did you...? Why... why would you paint... this? The inspiration came to me on a mountaintop. What should I paint? Huh?  Every night in my dreams I see you  I feel you...  Huh. He loves 'em! All right, listen up. All the suckers come out for art crawl. And they all want to pay money for crap. So paint some crap, and we can sell it. Wait. You're not painting? No, I'm management. You two paint the stuff, I'll do the rest. I'll be wheeling and dealing. I'll be getting my percent. Okay, let's see what you got so far. Time's up. Paint brushes down. What the hell is this? I told you to paint commercial touristy crap. I'm sorry I'm not a sellout. I can only paint what I feel. And I can only paint the truth! The robots are coming! (Imitates laser g*ns firing) Hide! Ah, this is great. You guys want to be real artists, huh? Okay, that's an angle. I can sell that. But if you're going artsy, then you're going all the way. Someone's cutting off an ear. I need both of mine. I wear glasses. Welp, what's your excuse? Don't got one. Have at it. Teddy, what's wrong? You haven't touched your food. I don't, Bob. It's just the, uh... The anuses? Yeah. Yeah, you know. Yeah, they're, uh... I know. Oh, they're like Mona Lisa's eyes. They follow you wherever you go. Ooh, you're right. Well, I like 'em! You like 'em? Ugh. Yeah. What's the problem? The anus is the window of the butt. It's true. I guess she's just painting what we're all thinking. Well, okay, but, mort, would you hang them up in your funeral home? 'Course not. That would be terrible for business. I'm not an idiot. Count to three, but do it on "two." I'll keep it on ice until art crawl's over. Thanks, t. Here goes. Now listen, gene. I'm gonna have trouble cutting through the cartilage at first. Mm-hmm. (Groaning) While I'm doing it, just think about your art. Okay! All right. Ready? Ninja robot. Ninja robot. Ninja robot. One... two... (Grunts) Hey, kids. Oh, hey, dad. I had to get away from those anuses for a while. You mean mort and Teddy? No. No. Your... Gayle's paintings. What are you kids doing? What knife?! What do you mean, what knife? Why are you holding a knife? Why am I holding a knife? She's turning me into a real artist. No, she's not. Put the knife down, Louise. I want to be an artist! Like Leonardo Dicaprio. That's right. That's Da Vinci, gene. No! The only way I can sell this garbage is if I make them legit! Hey, wait a second. I have an idea. You know who loves the stuff you kids draw? You? No. Your mother. This crap is like catnip to her. She can't resist it. Bring 'em inside. All right, we need to get these up before they get back. Your mom will be so excited to see this stuff, she won't even notice that I took Gayle's paintings down. Pretty manipulative, dad. I see where I get it. Thank you. You should see my taxes. Uh, what's this supposed to be? A ninja robot fighting a vampire tape recorder at stonehenge. Who's that in the background? That's my friend Ken. Why is he like that? He's an albino. Oh. Yeah. I've never met Ken. Is he real or imaginary? He's real, and he does improvised hip-hop. Okay, how old is he? He's 28. You can't have a 28-year-old, albino friend. Yes, I can! All right, I can't deal with this right now. Tina, what do you got? It's our dentist. Dr. Yap? Why is he nude? Wait, has he been nude with you, Tina?! I exercised some artistic license. Uh, I... We're switching dentists. No! I can't deal with that right now. But... Let's get 'em up. (Door bells tinkle) (Sighs) Linda, Gayle. How was lunch? Very interesting. I think...  the waiter might have been hitting on me.  Yes. He was very attentive. And he asked you a lot of questions about food. What was that all about? Uh, Bob? Where are my paintings? What? Wha...? Oh, I had to take a few down to make room for the kids' stuff. Bobby! Aw. The kids' stuff! Yeah. It's like our wall is a giant refrigerator. I love it. Huh. Gee, Bob, if I didn't know any better, I'd think... You didn't like my paintings. What, no? I... Aw. No, no, no. I know when I'm being lied to, Bob. It's like when I look at myself in the mirror and say, "it's going to be okay." Fine, look, Gayle, I'm gonna level with you. No. No, Bob. No. No leveling. No. Here we go. Gayle, the thing about your paintings... Bobby! Ah... Oh, look, senior visitors! Yay! (Laughing): Oh. Well, look who it is. Great. The art store people. Oh! Reflections. I love that store! I love your yarn. What can we get for you? I'm not here as a patron. I'm here as Edith Cranwinkle, chairperson of the art crawl. I rushed right over here because there are murmurs, whispers and murmurs around town, that you're displaying... (Whispers) Certain offensive orifices during the art crawl. Offices? Orifices! Ahh-ha! Not anymore. I took them all down. Oh, what a relief. I'm glad you agree with my decision. Your decision? What decision? That you can't display that type of art here. Wait. I can't? Absolutely not! It's obscene. Obscene. Oh, really? Yes. I won't allow it. (Laughs) Excuse me? You won't allow it? That's right, Tubsy. You heard her. Who are you two to tell me what I can or can't hang on my wall? I am chairperson of the art crawl. Well, I'm the chairperson of this restaurant. And you know what? They're gonna go back up. How dare you! Aw, Bobby! Gene, Louise, go get the paintings. Here they are! (Both gasping) Step into the butt closet! I will not! You should try it. I will not! What's it going to take to get you into this rhino anus today? You are in direct violation of my wife, Bob. Oh, I am, am I? Well, how about this? Horse anus. Oh! Oh! Look at it. No! Oh. Chicken anus. No! Take a closer look. Fox anus. Harold! Gayle, I'm commissioning a new series of anus paintings. Two words... bigger and more. Oh! Out! Aah! I cast you out. (Edith yelling) Harold: Oh, my gosh. Keep 'em coming, Gayle! Gayle: Almost done! Oh, my, I feel like I could fall into this one! Bob, I thought you didn't want to become the anus restaurant. Well, I've embraced it. We are the anus restaurant, lin. A-nus! A-nus! Kids. Bob & kids: A-nus! A-nus! A-nus! That's right! Go tell your friends! Or don't. Either way. It's your choice. Hey, you asked for this, lin. I'm just doing what you wanted me to do, support your sister. Oh, what a crock of crap! This is about you and your pride and that Edith. And you just want to provoke her. Damn right, I do. This one big enough for you, Edith?! (Crazed laughing)   (Laughter grows louder) (Yells) Fresh from their triumphant debut at Bob's burgers! That's right, gallery-quality paintings at sidewalk prices. Art lover, check this out! Hey, that's Dr. yap. He's my dentist. That's a good likeness in the face, but, uh... The proportions are off. No, I... the proportions are right. Well, I'm getting adult braces. So? So I should know! Dr. yap has short, strong legs, and his torso is... Well, I'm off to do some more roller-skating! You know what? I've done all I can for you hacks. You refuse to paint touristy art, dad won't let me cut off gene's ear... we're through! We are through! I'm dropping you as my clients, and I'm dropping you as my siblings! Go take some art classes, you wannabes! Hey, Andy, Ollie. Hm? Huh? You, too, red. Huh? Come here. You ever heard of the game, "you guys paint whatever I say and then I sell it"? Does the winner get a hug from Ollie? Ah, Andy, you can have one of those any old time. Now? Ooh! Ooh, ooh, ooh! Mmm... All right, stop hugging! Let's paint! Let's paint shells and sunsets and crap! Yay! Yay! Yay! Attention everyone! This installation is not approved by the art crawl association. It's obscene, and should be taken down immediately! Well, I'll tell you this... it doesn't need to be approved by the art crawl association, because this is now a permanent installation. (Gasps) Permanent? You'll regret this, Bob! Oh, is that a threat? Oh, when I threaten you, you'll know it! Yeah, when she threatens you, you'll know it! Okay, was that a threat? You bet it was! Is that supposed to scare me? Defi... (Hacking) (Continues coughing) Yes. (Hacking) You want some water? He would never drink your water! I really need s... (Hacking) He's fine! (Phlegmy grunt) You're fine. (Hoarsely): I could use some water. You're fine. Bob, water. No! He'd rather die than drink your water! I wouldn't! Yes, he would! I'll drink it! No, water, Harold! Please! Never! (Screams)   Edith! Bob: Unbelievable. This is nuts. I can't believe Edith would do this. (Gayle gasps) My artwork! It's ruined! They painted underpants on my beautiful anuses! Gayle, Gayle, no need to go off the deep end, okay? You should be flattered, right? All the great artists get censored. They do not. Yes, yes! All of 'em do. Every... all the good ones. Oh, God, what a whirlwind we've been on. I feel like let's just put this all behind us and move on. I'm going down there. What? Where? To see Edith. Bobby, don't do anything crazy. I'm not crazy, they're crazy! And they're not gonna get away with it! Glue that shell in the middle, Andy! What are you doing?! My hand is cramping up! I ate too much glue! Andy, Ollie, come here. Listen, I'm pushing you because you've got talent, babies. And I'm gonna take care of you, oh, you better believe it. But first you've got to make some money for mommy. Okay, babies? You, too, red. What's your name, sweetheart? Devin McJim... Shut up! It doesn't matter! Stop talking! Start working! Work! Shells go in the middle! Louise: Here you go. One-of-a-kind original. Help support these poor, deformed orphans. 20 bucks. (Strained grunting) Whoa. Dad's pissed. That's a take five. For me! Not you! (Strained grunting) Oh, look, everyone, the town pornographer. Can it, Edith. I'm here to get an apology. For what, standing up for artistic integrity and common decency? There's nothing decent about what you did. First you tried to tell me what to put on my walls, then you vandalized it. Have you no shame? I have no idea what you're talking about. And neither does he. What? Hit her, dad! I'm not gonna hit her, Louise. Hit her, dad! Gene? Tina? What are you two doing here? Learning to paint. We're honing our craft. Okay, well, good luck trying to Polish a turd. Wait, I thought you hated my kids. My artwork shop is open to all who respect art. So I'll have to ask you to leave. Then ask me. Please leave. Not before I get an apology. Not on your life! Have it your way, art lady! Hey. Poke her in the eye with the brush. Oh, I've got a better idea, Louise. Ha-ha-ha! Take that! (Gasps) Dad, what is that? It's an anus. Others: Oh... What else would it be? What has this been all about? You call that an anus? It looks just like a black dot! What kind of anus is that? Oh! Well, then, Harold, it looks like I'll need to practice a little more. I'll say. How about one right here! Edith: Oh! And what about here! Ow! This one might need an anus! Edith: Aah! How about this lighthouse! Bob: It has an anus now! (Gasping) Looking good, dad. Thanks, teen. Rip that lighthouse a new one, dad! I feel so alive! This is what God must feel like. Kids, tell your mother not to wait up! Use the brown! Use the brown! Louise: You should've seen it, mom. Dad went nuts! Aw, Bobby, what'd you do? I got justice, lin. Dad painted an anus on a lighthouse. (Laughs) Yeah. And on a Mountain and on a sunset and on a sailboat... And on Dr. yap. And Ken. Yeah, I'm sorry I painted on your paintings, kids. They were in the line of fire. You painted anuses on paintings? Where's Gayle? I got to tell her how I stood up for her. She's in the basement trying to get the underwear off her paintings. You shouldn't have done it, Bob. Are you kidding, lin? It's the best thing I've ever done in my life. Ow. See, that's how you put on handcuffs. They don't look tight enough to me. Why are these on me? Because you anally defaced her property. But she started it... look what she did. Edith: Oh. I like the new direction and wish I could take credit. But like I said, I had nothing to do with it. Yeah, we'll see about that. I'm pressing charges. We're gonna take this to court! Wait, now you're charging her? This is confusing. Is dad going to jail? I'll wait for you. Word of advice, dad: Don't tell your cell mate what you're in for. I hope our new dad is a blond. I can't take it anymore! Edith didn't paint the underwear! I did it! (Others gasping) What? You painted all those underpants, Linda? Oh, I couldn't help it. Those anuses were haunting me in my sleep. (Bouncy classical music playing)    Linda: Anus! Anus! Anus! No...! You were the one who said we had to support your sister. I did support her, until I figured out a way to destroy her art while preserving her feelings and blaming someone else. I thought those looked familiar. Gene: Oh, yeah! Mom! You painted your own underwear! What? How do you know what my underwear looks like? How don't I know? She wears it around the house, flaunting it, like she's all that. I do not! Okay, Bobby, let's go to jail. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Can't I... Edith, can't I just pay for the paintings? Well, the retail value of what you destroyed was over a thousand dollars! We'll give you $200. We haven't sold a burger all week, lin. We don't have that kind of money. I got this one, dad. Are we good here? Fine! We'll take it. Me and you can settle up later. Where the hell'd you get all that money from? Shh. Don't ask, don't ask. It's art crawl. But... Shh! Shh, shh, shh, shh, shut your mouth. It's art crawl. What... but I... Shh! Shut your mouth. But the m... Shut your mouth. I... I said shut your mouth. It's art crawl. Come on, Harold, let's get out of this ass parlor. It stinks! O-okay. You know, Linda, none of this would have happened if you'd just been honest with your sister. It's true, mom. I've been honest with these two since the day gene got fat. I remember the ice cream sandwich that did it. I regret nothing! And Tina... bad breath every day. Not if you like fish. See how tough they are? We've been desensitized. I'm so numb. All right, from now on, I'm going to be honest with my sister. She deserves to know the truth. Gayle: I did it! I did it! I fixed all the paintings! I added pants and huge, pendulous breasts. Oh, I'm so excited! I think it's my best work ever. What do you think? I'm not hearing anything. Oh, my God. Gayle, it's beautiful. They're great. They look great. Great. Great! They're great! Fantastic! Yes, they are... Yeah, look at that! Very, very... I knew it! I knew they were great! Here, you hang these, and I'm gonna go back down and finish the rest of 'em. Oh, I couldn't do it. I wouldn't have done it. There's exceptions to the honesty policy. Yeah, yeah, I mean, lin, you did the right thing. Oh, thank you for supporting me. I want to hug each and every one of you! Come here, all of you! Come on! All right. (Pained grunting) Oh, I love my family! I love you! Let me out of your love jail! Ow! (Linda grunting) (Crickets chirping) Do you think she's coming back? I don't know. I'm so cold. Cut me open and crawl inside me. One of us should live. Okay. Louise: Mama's comin' back, and mama better see some paintings! (Scream)
Okay. Burn unit, commence. You go first. Oh, I play soccer, 'cause I forgot I have hands. Burn! I'm on the news, because I have a huge head. Burn! Louise: I can't outrun a lawnmower 'cause my dress is so tight. Oh! I'm dead. Burn. (Stirring Western music plays) Whoa. It's Banjo. Oh, I'm a cowboy, and I got... Wait, wait, wait. Suspend burn unit. This is a great movie. It's a Spaguetti Western, the best one, underappreciated. He plays a Banjo. Yeah, I can see that. And they made a whole bunch of these. Dad. Do we have anything bigger than this? Oh, Gene, what'd you do? Nothing, yet. Just planning ahead. (g*nf*re on television) What are you guys watching? Nothing. Go back to bed. The burn unit is just me and dad. (g*nf*re) Whoa! Did he just sh**t bullets out of his Banjo? Yes. Damn! Oh, you like that, Gene? 'Cause we're changing the channel. No, no. Let's watch it. This is pretty much the beginning. What? What?! Gene, sit here. (Grunts) It's like pushing a couch off the couch! Yah! Here. Hold my plunger. Louise: Yah! Gene: Ow! Linda: Oh! We are just so thrilled that you chose us to cater the event. (Quietly): Mom, mom... fill me up. I just hope we can live up to last year's event. Mom. That Colleen Caviello, mom... She really outdid herself. And never lets anyone forget about it. Just fill up the little mug. Ouch. Right. Right, right. Okay, Mr. Frond. Good-bye. Good-bye. So what are we catering? That sounded promising. Oh, it's a real big deal, Bobby. It's a fund-raiser for Tina's conflict resolution club. Colleen Caviello made the food last year. This year she can go... Blow a balloon. Yay! You're catering our fund-raiser. That's great. How much does it pay? Nothing. Nothing? It's a benefit, Bobby. It's a spaghetti dinner. But we don't make spaghetti. This is school fund-raising, Bob... it's a pasta game. You make spaghetti, or you go home. Besides, it's for a good cause. Oh, yeah... to one-up Colleen Caviello. That's a, that's a great cause. You weren't there, Bob! You don't know how awful it was. (Slow, distorted): This is delicious. (Slow, distorted): Oh my God, I love this ziti. (Slow, distorted laughter) (Distorted laughter continues) (Slow, distorted): They love my ziti. And that was the worst day of my life. Anyway, this isn't about Colleen, this is about Tina. We're raising money to buy a bulletproof trash can so gang members can finally throw out their g*ns. Aw. And we're teaching conflict resolution skills you can use in your own lives. That's right, Tina. And Mr. Frond is running the whole thing. Ugh, Mr. Frond? He's a tall drink of... Annoying. That may be true, but you're gonna drink that drink, mister. I don't want to. I have worked too hard to get us this event, so you'll be nice to Frond, and you'll make spaghetti and meatballs! No... no... Yes... yes! Fine, but I'm gonna half-ass it. Yay. Dad, check it out. Little princess guitar. Gene, that's mine! You never use it. I'm like Banjo. What's the bad guy's name? Ceviche. Ceviche, yeah. He reminds me of this kid at school... Choo-Choo. Choo-Choo? Yeah. He's kind of my Nemesis. If I'm telling a joke, he'll say the punch line before I do. A vampire walks into a bar and says I'll have a... I'll have a blood lite. Huh? What do you call a Spanish guy with a rubber toe? Roberto! Rober... (Groans) What kind of bees make milk? Boo-bees! Boo-bees! (Angry grunting) So, I'm gonna use this guitar to stand up to Choo-Choo like Banjo. That's, uh... That's great, Gene. But I think your face is wrong. My face is wrong?! Yeah, you should do the Banjo icy stare. Like this? (Chuckles) No. Not like that. (Growling) No, no, no. Don't growl. That... Like this? Hmm. Maybe try that. Is Choo-Choo scared of stroke victims? Terrified. Hey, Gene, Gene. How do you plead? I'm innocent. Your fingerprints were all over the m*rder weapon. I don't have fingers. Your honor! I don't have time for this. What?! You don't have time for food court? Where are you going? Hey. Wanna hear a good one? (Groans) What's green and sings? Go ahead. Do it. El... Ah. (Plays note) Elvis P... Elvis Par... Ah! (Plays note) Forget it. I'll tell you what's green and sings... Elvis Parsley. (Laughing) You don't say the punch lines to other people's jokes anymore. You got that, Poo-Poo? (Plays note, kid guffaws) What the hell? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, everyone. Thank you. Anyway... Gene, look. They're about to announce the verdict. Guilty. No! Take him away. Gene, where are you going? What's up with Gene? I don't know, Lasagna. (Sighs) I don't know. You know, cooking spaghetti isn't even cooking. It's just, like, boiling water. Hey, Bobby, can I come to this thing? Uh, I don't think so. Why not? Some of these moms are divorced, right? They meet me, I meet their kids. Maybe throw the ball around. Not inside, but... uh, we agreed no more school events for you, Teddy. Hey, dad. Guess what? What? I acted like Banjo and took Choo-Choo down. (Plays chord) Everyone laughed. Well, one kid laughed. Peter Pescadero. He has a learning disability. Yeah, but he knows what's funny. (Plays note) Now that you stood up for yourself... Oh, congratulations, Gene... Can we stop talking about it? Okay, tonight, I propose, dad, that after everyone else goes to bed... Gene... We fire up the burn unit and we watch Canine Criminals, and then that stretching show, and then maybe a little Beetlejuice in Español Beetlejugo. Beetlejugo. Beetlejugo. Ay, ay, ay, ay! I would, except a certain best dad in the world went out and got this! It's the complete Banjo box set! All 12 DVDs and over 28 hours of extras. Yeah! 28 hours?! Dad, can I... see that fork for a minute? Um... here. Thank you. And I just want to... (Grunting) Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! (Screaming): No! Best part right here, Gene. There's only gonna be two shots, me sh**ting you, and then me drinking this sh*t of whiskey. (sh*t fires on TV) Wow. Oh, what a line. Go ahead, watch your stupid movie. There are other people for me to hang out with around here. Tina, get up. Let's hang out. Okay. Maybe we can practice conflict resolution. Say something mean to me so I can not react. Anything I want? Yeah. Ha-ha! Well, uh, your room looks like it was decorated by a perverted jockey. When you say that, what I feel is that you're trying to hurt my feelings. Oh, my God. Why do you talk so (slowly): Slow? When you say that, what I feel is that you're trying to hurt... Oh man, Tina. This is really, really boring. Okay, well... Hey, mom, you want to hang out? Oh, I'd love that! Oh, mother-daughter bonding time. Just like me and my mother. Ooh! Makeover! Hmm... Okay, my little cowpokes. Time for school. You can watch the rest tonight. Mom! How could you? How could I what? How could you encourage this? Oh, Louise, don't be a pill. A little father-son bonding is going on here and that's a good thing. These two don't always do it so well. Tambourine solo! Sheesh. All right, this is how you throw a spiral. You ready? Here comes a bullet. Hmm. Oh, stupid ball! It's 'cause there's no laces. I'm hungry. All right, we're done. Go inside. I want peanut butter! It turns out we bond better over movies that I like to watch, that I make Gene watch. Yeah. Oh, that's... That's adorable. I'm going to school. Good. Great. Why don't you learn something and become a lawyer. Abs: The conflict resolution program sweeping our school. You all know my system, and at the spaghetti dinner, so will your parents or legal guardians, um, Becky, 'cause your mom's in jail. Tina, Jocelyn, Jimmy junior... let's rehearse. Becky, you just watch. Tina here just found out that her best friend Jocelyn told Jimmy junior that Tina, is "whack." And... acting. Tina, Jocelyn told me you are whack. Jocelyn, you skank. I hate you. Whatever. It's true. You are whack. (Both grunting stiffly) And... freeze! Well, that resolved nothing. Let's rewind, shall we? (Imitating rewinding tape) Let's work out our abs. A! Access your feelings! When you gossiped about me to Jimmy junior, it hurt my feelings. B: Be apologetic! Sorry. S: Slap it! Well done. Do it just like that at the dinner. Oh, enjoy your lunch, everyone. If you ever gossip about me to Jimmy junior outside of a conflict resolution skit, I'll punch you in the face. It was just a skit, Tina. I will punch you. Again and again, and again and again... My God, what a psycho. And again and again... And again and again and... Well, the important thing is, I shared this movie with Gene and it helped him stand up for himself at school. Eh, I beat up a lot of kids like Gene when I was his age. Not that I was a bully... just kids like Gene, you know? That get beat up. Bob, how are the meatballs comin'? Because they need to be perfect. Hey, it's just like your burgers, only spherical! Hey! Hey, what? They're not for you. They're for me to show off in front of the other moms at the fund-raiser. Bobby, make one extra-big for Colleen Caviello to choke on. Okay. All right, looks like I'm sitting with you today. Here's the pecking order: Me, then either of you. Which sticker do you like better, my purple ladybug or Susie's red one? And good-bye. Hey there, Spew-Spew. Funny seeing you here. In the cafeteria during lunch? Yeah. (Plays note) Why do you keep doing that? Keep doing what? (Plays note) You're weird! Weird? I think you mean anti-hero. Look at the hat. It's mom's sun hat, you dork. You like finishing my jokes. Well, finish my food. Gene, you are being a class act jerk. This is all about jokes from your stupid joke book. You've insulted Jokes for Blokes for the last time. (Grunts) Oh, don't you even think about it, Gene. Food fight! (Kids grunting)   (Slow, distorted): No...! And these two, Bob, were throwing at each other. I hate you. I hate you. They seem to be in conflict. I'm sure we can, uh, work through it. I'd like you to take a look at my abs. Um, no thank you. Show him your abs, Mr. Frond. We'd all like to see your abs. Okay. I really don't. And your ding-dong. Gene. Gene, why don't you access how it makes you feel that Louise is angry with you. Fine. (Plays note) That's all I'm gonna say. Well, this is all I'm gonna say. Hi-yah! (Grunting) Let go of my... H-hey. L-Louise, Louise, Louise. You're not using your abs. Um, this is dumb. (Chuckles): Bo... Bob. Yes. When you say "this is dumb," it makes me feel like pinching you in the eye. (Laughs): Why did you do that? So we can resolve this and set a good example for your children. Okay. I will now kick you in the shin. (Chuckles) Okay. Okay. All right. (Plays note) Hey! Don't throw repressed memory Emily! She won't remember this. Well, this is really working out, Mr. Frond. Your system is amazing. Ho. No, no, no, no, no. We're gonna go. You know what I forgot to say? Detention! Detention! And you, I am gonna cut you! I am gonna cut you out of the conflict resolution spaghetti dinner! Wha... oh, come on, you can't... Too late! The conflict resolution spaghetti dinner will now be a conflict resolution fast. Well, that didn't go so well. Mm-mm. Yeah, he seemed angry. Frothy. And kind of bloated, right? Mm. Maybe he's dehydrated. (Groans) Your mother's gonna k*ll me. Frond: So glad we had a chance to talk this out! (Grunting, punch thuds) Emily, I'm sorry! Detention?! And we're banned from catering the peace club dinner! Bobby! I'm sorry, Lin, I... I can't even tell you how many favors I had to call in to cater that thing. How many? Two! Tina, you're supposed to be watching the restaurant. I'm too upset to serve food. W-what'd you do? Did you lock up? Yes. Were there customers inside? I don't know. No one's gonna come to the fund-raiser now. Good job, Bobby! It's not my fault, Lin. It was Mr. Frond's fault. And Louise's. And Gene's! And most of all, that stupid movie. Hey! Hey, don't blame the movie. All right. Leave bingo out of this! Shut up! (All arguing) All of you! I'm locking these movies in my jewelry drawer. Aw, come on. Unfair! 'Bout time. You're overreacting, Lin. The hell I am! I'm in charge of a spaghetti dinner that's not gonna have any spaghetti! If we all just worked on our abs... Not now with that crap, Tina! I can't believe I got detention. I can't believe I got detention. If I were you, I would teach Gene a lesson he'll never forget. I had a perfect record. And then you tainted it. Taint. Looks like you got Choo-Choo right where you want him. Just give him that icy stare with some little princess and finish him. You want a little of this? (Shuddering fearfully) Oh. Oh, yeah, he wants it. Now give him the icy stare. (Growls) Put him in his place. You're dead! Quiet! (Over headphones):  s*xual, s*xual  (Grunting along to funk music) Okay, well, I'm gonna go get Gene and Louise from detention. Great! Bring some meatballs. Got plenty of meatballs. All dressed up and nowhere to go. Mmm. Meatball. Mmm. All right. (Chewing noisily) I'm gonna leave. Gene, this happens now! Uh, how are we doing this? Staring contest? (Howls) Joke-off? Kick his ass, Choo-Choo! Why are their shirts off? Oh, boy. I didn't want to do this. I haven't even pressed the blue button yet. I don't even know what sound... (Howling, screaming) Fight! Fight! Fight...! Stop. There's not gonna be a fight. Oh, thank God. Let me go! This train is off the tracks. Choo-Choo! Oh, I get the name now. I always thought it was 'cause of how he chewed. 'Cause he chews like a train. Hey, calm down. Let's go home, Gene. You touching my kid? Sorry. What? I said, you touching my kid? Oh, he was attacking my kid. Oh, yeah? Good. What is going on with the shirts? I'm gonna beat your ass so bad I can skip the gym tonight. Dad, this is bad. Boys: Fight! Fight! Thank you, Louise. Fight! Fight...! I have it under control. This happens now! Choo-Choo: k*ll him! (Yelling) Run! I can't. I've got this friggin' guitar around my neck! Louise: Ha! (Both yelling) Bob: Oh, Gene, push down. I'm trying. All right. (Grunts) Louise: Ow. All right, just so we're clear, we're not hiding from those guys. We're respectfully declining their invitation for a fight, okay? Right. No, thank you. I would absolutely get into a fight under the right circumstances, if... (Sniffs) What's that smell? Oh, Gene! Gene! I'm sorry! Hey, shh, shh. I hear them. (Gasps) They're coming. Real...? You-you hear them? Gotcha. Louise, enough. You've been stirring the pot for three days, and acting like a baby. Now you owe your brother an apology for getting him in trouble. Me?! Both of you owe me an apology. Both of us? Why? Because we wanted to watch Banjo? Because you stopped hanging out with me. What? Shh. Use your slide voices. First, the burn unit stopped hanging out. Then, the lunch bunch stopped hanging out. God, we have lame names. Who the hell am I gonna hang around, if not you two? Mom and Tina... the menstruation nation? Ugh! That's a really bad name. You're all I've got. Louise, I'm sorry. Me, too. Don't cry. Ha! Got you. You thought I was really crying. Gross. (Farts) Gene, stop. Oh, my God. I can't help it. It's anxiety. And turkey jerky. (Sniffs) It's so incredible. Your farts smell like mine. Really? Oh, great. Are you guys bonding again? I'm sorry, but that's a huge discovery. A fart is like a fingerprint, and we have the same fingerprints. High-five. Ugh! Put your hand up. All right. I swear my farts smell like your farts, dad. I don't think so, Louise. Oh, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. (Farts quietly) Huh? (Sniffs) No. That smells like your mom's. No! Oh, your mom. What are we gonna do about mom and Tina? They could live in here with us! I think I know a better way. I'm starving. How embarrassing. Guess people will be talking about my baked ziti for another year. (Mocking): Guess people will be talking about my baked ziti for another year. Oh, Linda, I didn't see you. Hi, Coll. How are you? (Amplified over P.A.): Uh... Thank you. Tonight, with your help, we raised over $100. It was $110. I warned you, skank! (Grunting) Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Girls, please. It's not time for the skit. This isn't a skit. It's... This is real life. Last year, the only fighting was to get seconds on my ziti! Okay, that's it, Colleen. Let me tell you about that ziti. That sauce was store-bought, and you know it. (Gasping) Ladies, please! I thought I told you, Bob. You and your spaghetti aren't welcome here. But I want to say something. No, thank you. I've had enough of your hurt speech. Would it make a difference if I... Worked on my abs? Oh. I want to... a... What was a again? Anus. Amyl nitrate. Access... I want to access my feelings. Frond: Mm. Okay, okay, okay, okay, enough, enough, enough, enough. Everyone's about to k*ll each other here. Let's... let's eat! Linda: All right! Meatballs! Meatballs! Get your meatballs here. And spaghetti. Here, Colleen, why don't you put these balls in your face? Louise: Food fight! Bob & Linda: No, no, no...!
All right, listen, you kids are gonna be on your best behavior, right now. The landlord, Mr. Fischoeder's, coming over to talk about the lease, and we don't know if he's gonna renew. He'll renew. Well, we haven't always paid our rent on time. We never pay our rent on time. Thanks, lin. Uh. All right, listen. Your mother and I are gonna go make him some food. That's gonna save us; Our food, and our service. You kids start cleaning now. Pick that up. And, Gene, you go outside and try and drum up some business. I'll play my triangle! Ding-da-da-ding, da-da-ding, da-da-ding, da-da-ding... No! You don't understand my music! Shush. And here's the other important thing: When Fischoeder gets here, you will not... I repeat, not... stare at him like he's some kind of spectacle. I don't-I don't ever stare at him. I-I don't stare at him. I don't know what you're talking about. Um... Yes, Mr. Fischoeder is an eccentric. Yes, he wears a white suit. And an eye patch. And he drives a golf cart everywhere. Louise: He is one white cat away from being a super-villain. All right, but he owns this building, everybody. He owns the amusement park, and just about everything else in town, so you're not going to stare at him when he gets here. (Children whistle and hum) Here we go! Bob, Linda, your children are refusing to acknowledge me. Ah, kids, stop doing that. Acknowledge Mr. Fischoeder, right now. Are you a superhero? Can I feel your hair? Stop! Stop! Go clean something, now. All of you. So, uh, Mr. Fischoeder, you know, after all these years, I've realized, you've never eaten my food. Mm-hmm. And I want to present to you one of my favorite specialty burgers. Oh, no offense, Bob, but I have a policy that I don't dine at any of my tenants' establishments. Oh. But I saw you eating at juicy Sushi. That's different. That place is incredible! Have you had their starfish? It melts in your mouth. No? Nobody? You? No. Anywho... Quiet in here. Like this a lot, Bob? Yeah, well, I mean, it's 12:30. Sorta the lunch lull. The lunch lull. That's what we call it. Huh. Wow. Jimmy Pesto's lunch lull is really busy. Bob: Well, Jimmy Pesto's is a pizza place If you're into that kind of thing... pizza. (Laughing): Stupid. I like pizza. Pizza?! Where's pizza?! Shush. Anyway, when people want a burger... A good American burger... They have nowhere else to go, but... Sorry. Sorry to interrupt. Let me be honest with you. I enjoy you, Bob. Your mustache, -it's fascinating. Thank you. Do you mind if I...? You're touching it. Yeah. I... That's... Yeah, you're... That's really something. Thank you. Thank you. Mmm... Hmm... hmm... Listen, Jimmy Pesto has tendered an offer on this space. Jimmy Pesto?! He wants to move over here? Yes, he wants to move his gift shop over here. Gift shop?! This would be an amazing gift shop! (Gasp) I could do all my Christmas shopping here! Yes! No, no, no, no, no, no. Please, I-I think if you tried my burger, you'd see that... Bob, you're always late with the rent. And Jimmy pays early. Wait, wait, wait, Mr. Fischoeder, please. Be-before you make a decision, just taste my burger. Just taste it. (Sighs) Fine. Another trip to the gym. Jimmy Pesto may be a good businessman, (choking) But I think you'll find that, unlike his microwaved junk, my food is... Mr. Fischoeder? Mr. Fischoeder? He-he's choking. He's chok... How do I do it?! What do I do? You just push! Push! Push on his belly! Hit him in the crotch! No, Gene! Don't hit him in the crotch. Yes! Hit him in the crotch! I'll hold his hair. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Linda, please. Oh, my God! Wow! He's turning blue! Gene: Put his hand in warm water! He can't die! He cannot die in here! Let's move him outside. No, everybody, hands around him! Group heimlich! One... Family: ...Two, three! (Family screams) Bob: There it is! Holy crap! (Sighs) Give him some room, kids. Give him room! Oh... ow... So, um... Ow... Did you, uh, did you like it? (Sighs) Your rent is due Friday night. And if you're late, I'm giving your lease to Jimmy Pesto. Do you want me to pack this to go? You're gonna need fries with that. (Bob sighs) Linda: So Mr. Fischoeder is okay... But we've got to pay the rent in full by tomorrow night. Paying the rent in full! What's next? Paying your other bills? Don't worry. We'll figure something out. Right, Bobby? Jimmy... Freaking... Pesto. Linda: Oh, Bob. You know, Pesto's not his real name; It's Poplopovich. Of course it is. The guy's a complete phony. What is this obsession with him? I'm not obsessed with him. Yeah, you are. You're both obsessed. It's like you guys are stalking each other. (No voice) I could care less about the guy. I think you should both grow up, at least for the kids' sake. Let me see. Let me see. Ugh. The kids. Why does Tina have to like Jimmy Pesto Jr.? Of all the 13-year-old boys in the world... Eh, she likes them, too. It's kind of romantic, though... two families at war, a budding romance... It's like West Side story! Ugh! (Humming dramatic melody) Rumble! (Hums dramatically) Stop. You know Louise is friends with the twins, now, too... Pesto's little boys... Andy and Ollie. No, no, no. I'm calling a ban on all the Pesto kids. Our kids are going to cease contact. Let's be best friends forever. Okay. Let's cut our hands and press them together and become blood brothers! Okay! (Grunts) No, spit brothers! Spit in your hand and then shake. Let's do both! Sorry, I'm saving my spit and blood for my honeymoon. Let's rub our eyes together. You can get my pink eye! Okay! Twins (in unison): Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ooh... So hard to be friends these days. Hey, is that your brother Jimmy, touching himself all over? Ollie: Yeah, he's really into slow dancing now. Louise: He knows it's supposed to be with other people, right? It is? Ugh, look at Tina. Kissed the guy, and she still can't get his attention. She should try pigs in a blanket. That always gets my attention. (Dreamy sigh) Bob: Ugh. What's he up to now? What!? Oh, my God! "Now serving burgers. " Burgers...! That's it. It's time for a showdown. All right.  We're going to a rumble  I'm gonna confront him.  gonna confront him  Confront him right in the face.  yeah, right in his handsome face.  What? What? You said "handsome face." You did. It's a... "Right in his handsome face. " I know what I said. You think he's handsome? God, yes. No, I'm saying it with anger, like, "you handsome face!" So he's... He's so handsome you wanna-you wanna punch him. He looks like tom Selleck. When I die, I want you to cremate me and throw my ashes in tom Selleck's face. (Laughing): That's a crazy request. I get it. All right, let's go. Kids, watch the restaurant. Oh, lord. So many people... Kids, watch the restaurant. Tina, watch the restaurant. Restaurant, we both know you can handle this. Call me if you need me. Love you. Jimmy said he'll be right out. You wanna try a Pesto-colada? No. Yeah, sure. Lin. What? Free drink. Yuck. Look at that. "Pasta la vista, baby"? "Frank and Zelda, oldies with goodies"? Ugh. Louise: Some confrontation. I want some action. I need some action. (Gasps) There's Jimmy Jr. (Sighs) Busing tables has never looked so sensual. Yet so menial. Tina: Yeah. Here's Jimmy. Now some fur's gonna fly. Bob of Bob's burgers. Jimmy so-called Pesto of Jimmy Pesto's. Let's skip the niceties, shall we? Pesto-colada for the lady... On the house. Thank you. Except for that nicety. (Clicks his tongue) What are you doing, Jimmy? What? Selling burgers, coming after my lease... What are you doing, Jimmy (Loudly): Poplopovich? Whoa... Yeah, your name is not what it says on the... Linda: Mmm. Mmm. Lin. Mmm, ah. (Laughs) Stop. Ah. It's good. (Groans) Bob, I run a business, all right? I don't know what you're doing, with your fancy ingredients. (Falsetto voice): "I'm Bob, and I like kale." Trev (Laughing): Kale! There's nothing wrong with kale. Why don't you call it snob's burgers? Snob's burgers, ha! You think anything that isn't frozen or rotten is fancy, Jimmy. Okay, Mr. fancy face, let's see who's got customers?  Ah, da-di-di-di...  Ah, I got some. Let's see who doesn't. Oh, you. Bob: Ha. I've got... I've got customers, Jimmy. They're not there right now. They have a life. Oh, yeah? Well, good luck making rent by tomorrow night. Well, good luck trying to steal my customers with your best-o burger. They'll never... Oh, my God! Bob! Unbelievable. We just came to watch the ball game. I had the urge to sing some journey! Come on, Linda, we're leaving! Go, go. Go, go, go, go. (Loud slurping) Hmm! You're not going to get our lease, Jimmy! He's going to get our lease. No, Bobby! Forget about Jimmy Pesto. All we need is one really good day of business, and then we can pay our rent and keep the place, huh? Huh...? I guess you're right. If we could pack the house tomorrow... Sure! A packed house. We can do that. Let's have a family brainstorm, right now. Gene, come on! Uh, live entertainment featuring a mix of techno... Yeah, yeah? And dad's favorite... The triangle!  Ding-ding-ding ding-ding ding ding-ding-ding.  Oh, yeah.    No. Tina, go! Slow dancing! Grind, grind... No. Grind... Tina, stop. What are you do... stop that. Louise, what do you got? When I was young and naive, I would have said "arson," but I'm gonna go with "voodoo." Hmm. I like arson. No. Seriously, dad... voodoo. I have a book. No, I have a book! No. I'll go get it. I got it. Make some flyers... For half-off, and good for tomorrow night only. You know, that might bring some people in. Yeah, yeah. Okay, I found it. Forget voodoo. We're doing flyers. What? Who's candy-ass idea was that? I'm out of the room for five seconds! Ah, we're on a roll. Let's brainstorm something else. Uh... Christmas card... No, no, no, we're done brainstorming... we got it. Oh. How 'bout we shave our heads for the Christmas card? Spell our names wrong. Shave our legs. Totally soft, silky family. I like it. I have a book! Nobody forget what they just said. I'm... I'm gonna go get some paper. Mmm. Eh, it's pretty good. (Chuckles) It's pretty good. It's not good! It's not good! Jimmy: Goin' in the garbage! If I can get a lock of Jimmy Pesto's hair, I'm pretty sure I can control his mind. Really? I don't know. I'm just skimming. All I know is it works on fools and imbeciles. Oh, me, me. Can you help me dance Jimmy Jr. Back into remembering we're going out? Yes, I can. I just need a lock of your hair. Okay. Can you help me get a gig in the music business? Hair. So long, old friend. Hair: Wait, can't we talk about this?! So if you stick the penny into the potato, you've just made a battery out of a potato. I've just made a voodoo doll out of a potato. Both: Oh! Who is it? My sister Tina. She wants me to make your brother slow-dance with her and remember that they're going out. Can you get a lock of your brother's hair? Yup. Agh! And you said I was crazy for carrying this around. Now who's laughing? (Laughs) Me! Both: Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Hi, kids. How was school? All: Good. Mom, Andy and Ollie are helping me with a school project. I'm gonna need 15 potatoes, a lock of hair from you and dad. Also rum and cigars, if you have any. Wait. What's this for? English. You two have homework? A little. Not doing it. Good 'cause you're going down to the pier to hand out flyers. (Grunting) Tina: We're back. Did you pass 'em all out? Yup. We saved the family. Jimmy Pesto even took one. So did Jimmy one wing. He's a seagull I met. What the hell? "Tonight only, our competitor's flyers "good for half-off your burger, plus a free t-shirt"? Oh, my God. Linda: Aw, Mort's bringing his mother to dinner. No. No. No! Those are my customers! This is a war now. This is a war. Listen, it's the theme from braveheart! Ding-ding-ding-ding, ding, ding... No! Wait, wait. This is the best part: Di... Dad, what are you doing? Mmm-mm. Mmm-mm. Shh! Gene, Tina, this may be our last chance to save the restaurant. Your father needs full concentration right now. He's attempting to make the most difficult burger known to man. I've only seen him do it once successfully. And now he has to do it in a mini sampler size. What is it? He calls it "the meatsiah." It's beef tartare inside a burger medium-well inside a burger Wellington. Is dad gonna die? Maybe, honey, maybe. Oh, he has to be happy with that one. So how is this gonna save the restaurant? Am I gonna put on the burger suit and hand these out in front? Oh, no. We're going straight to the source with these. You're gonna be handing these out in Jimmy Pesto's restaurant. Whoa. That's right, whoa. These samples are gonna get us our rent money tonight, so we can keep this place. How are free samples gonna get us money? They'll try the samples, and they'll love 'em, but they'll want more. More! They'll be craving these burgers, itching to get their fix! Like hero1n. That's right son, like hero1n! Yes! But this family's gonna have to execute perfectly to pull this off... where's Louise? Louise (Dramatically): This one shall have his first gig. This one shall slow dance upon that one. And Mr. Jimmy Pesto's fate is yet undetermined, because I still need to get some of his hair. I'm gonna go get it right now. Wanna come? We want to stay here. Forever. We wanna stay here forever and ever. We want to be buried here! Buried here! Okay, I'll bury you when I get back. Jimmy: You're taking hair donations? That's right. Hm, for people with mustache cancer? Yeah, it's a serious disease. Hey, aren't you Bob's kid? (Chuckles) No! No, no. Dad, Frank and Zelda both got the scampi, and now they're in the bathroom puking. Oh, for God's sake. Where am I gonna get another piano player at this hour? We could put on some boyz ii men and I could slow dance. Hey, pepper, no! For the thousandth time, no! It's my passion, dad! Passion! (Scoffs) I know a guy. (Ringing) Hello, Bob's burgers. You tell dad where you were going? Mm, he's working on his burger bites. Hey, there's a drum set. Back me up! Sorry, it'll just be another minute. We're really backed up in there. Gene got his wish! The voodoo is working! How you doin'? Nice shirt. Oh, my God! Gene's first public performance! Bob: These are almost done. Is everybody ready? Aw! And my Tina's dancin'. My little clam's coming out of her shell! I'm just gonna slip out for one sec! Bob: Okay, here we go. Time to go win back the restaurant! Linda? Kids? Oh, my God. Gene was supposed to wear the costume. Well, you know what? I'll do this myself. This next number's a slow jam. It's called "three sides don't make a square." Ding, ding, ding... Yup. Thank you. (Chuckles) What happened, did you snap? Did Mr. fancy face take a trip to the sexy store? No. It's a little small on you. A little tight in the pickles, huh? What's on the tray? These are burger bites, Jimmy. The best in the world. I'm gonna show your customers what real food is. Here, try a real burger, sir. Hey. Yeah, well... Eh-eh. I'm gonna go this way then. Nah-nah-nah. Yeah. Well, then I'm... Whoa! Dah-dah. Don't poke me. Aah! Real burgers. Right across the street. Hey, hey. Just move. (Mocking): Eh, just move. Shut... what? I didn't do it. Yeah, I did it. (Both gibber mockingly) Oh, no. Is that dad? And you people! Traitors! Traitor family! It's Gene's first public performance! You could had me at the ground floor, dad. Now I play the big rooms. You gotta let the kids have a little fun. We have fun, Linda! We have lots of fun! What's he wearin'? My buns. With a few extra buns hanging out the back. (Rimshot) Oh! Hey, dad, I'm playing drums! (Sarcastically): Oh, I'm so happy you're playing drums, Louise! And you know what? You should keep your freaky kids locked up in your own place. What did you say about my kids? Hit him in his handsome groin! (Grunting) Wait. Watch it. You.... I'm gonna. Ow! Hey. Wait. Wait. (Both grunting) Get him, dad. Come on! Come on! Don't worry, dad! Anything? Anything? I got the samples, Bobby. Aw, crap. That looks silly. Come for the rent? Yes, I've come for the rent. Bob! No, no, let 'em fight. Looks like a betting crowd. Who wants three-to-one against the burger? Right here! Yeah, let me see. Let me see. Wanna, here... oh! Very nice, thank you. All right, it's a draw. Who had "they end up hugging each other"? Me. That's ten to you. Thank you. Now Bob, Jimmy, let's all go over to Jimmy's new gift shop... I mean... sorry... Bob's place... and settle this over some nice alcohol, hmm? Bob... Do you have the rent? (Sighs) No. Not all of it. Okay then. Here we go. Oh, God. Give me your hands. Uh... sure. Do you cry easily? Um... sometimes. Well, let's get it over with. Bob, I will not be renewing... (Sniffs) Oh, what is that amazing smell? Who's hungry?! What are those? Only the holy grail of hamburgers... the meatsiah! Hmm... Are these... choke-resistant? They're bite-sized! Oh, good. Mmm... mmm! Mmmmm! Huh? I have never... Eaten a burger... Half... (Choking) Hit him in the crotch! Oh, no, no. I'm just kidding. As good as this. This is great! Yeah! Oh, it's, it's complicated it's-it's mystical, it's-it's barbaric... Thank you. Mmm. Mr. Fischoeder, I wanted to... I'm talking, Jimmy. I want to... I'm talking. Bob, you might be the worst tenant I've ever had, and I rent space to a raccoon sanctuary. I know. They're next-door. I've been meaning to talk to you about.... Shh. It's okay. Right. I get it now. You were trying to tell me the other day, but I wouldn't listen because I was choking to d*ath. Mr. Fischoeder, I just have... Jimmy, please! Please! I was thinking about my life, you see, and how I didn't want it to end in your pathetic little restaurant on your sad, filthy floor. Hey! But now I see it. You're not a businessman. You don't care about customers and money! Ha! No, I do. I do. No, no, you are an artist... a beef artist. A be-fartist! A poet! Who writes with meat and buns and pickles. Like a greasy, heterosexual Walt Whitman. Uh... thank you. Okay. Well, Mr. Fischoeder, I... Jimmy! No, it's fair... Jimmy! ...To talk. Please. Which brings me to your lea... Just 'cause I'm not greasy... Shut up! Which brings me to your lease. Let's extend it! All right, Bobby! But I gotta make it month-to-month. Eh. Oh... Um... all right. We'll take it. And I have to raise your rent a little. Hmm. Okay. That's... yes. Eh. Both: Daddy! Andy, Ollie, what are you doing here? Both: Voodoo! What? Both: Voodoo! Yeah, and we switched underpants! (Whispers): Ollie, that was a secret! I couldn't hold it in anymore! Wait. These are your kids? And you thought my kids were freaky? Come on, boys, we're leaving. No! We wanna stay! Yeah, it's fun here! Yeah, Jimmy. It's fun here. Ehh... Shush. All right! Let's celebrate! Yes! Gene? Ah, do us the honor. A little music? (Gasps) You believe in me. Time to tickle the iron. A ding, a dong, a ding-dong-ding. Slow jam. (Sighs) Come on, Jimmy Jr., let's get back to work. No, dad! I'm gonna dance with Tracy! Tina. Tina! Yup, voodoo works. I'm a God! Teddy: Am I doing this right? Mort, do I look sexy? My pants aren't falling down, are they, Mort? When I dance, sometimes my pants fall down.
That was my butt. What are you looking at? Smart money's on boogers. It's not a booger. Let the man think for himself! I don't think it's a booger. Who asked you?! It's getting bigger. It knows what we're thinking. Huh. It is definitely growing. I just hope it's not that green mold. It's called green mold. You see it in a lot of beach towns, and filthy, disgusting, poorly managed restaurants. Hey! So, they had to send you, Hugo? There's no one else that does this? I just got mold-certified. In a month, I'll be cleared for vermin, too. Oh, congratulations. Okay, gene, if you eat this mold I'll give you five... Whoa. Mmm. Gorgonzola. So what do I got to do? Use bleach on it or something? (Chuckles) Use bleach on it? Oh, I'll just put bleach on it. No, of course not, Bob. I hate you. This is big. You have to close. The whole building will have to be tented for 48 hours. Great. There goes our weekend revenue. Ooh, two days off! Bobby, we could use it. I guess it has been a while since we've had a break. Yeah. Ten years. What? That's... can't be right. Ten years. You're really living the dream, Linda. Aren't you done, Hugo? Sure, Bob, I'm done. Mold! Dangerous k*ller mold! Floating d*ath spores! Everyone move! Gene, how are you feeling? Kind of nauseous. A little light-headed. Pretty good. Glad I ate it. You say that about everything. Yeah. Green mold, huh? Yeah. You ever dealt with this stuff, ? Oh, sure. We get all kinds of moldy bodies at the home. Not on the bodies. I mean on the walls or... And you should see the shut-ins. Stop. One guy's back looked like a putting green! Oh, dear lord. Hey, you got to get out of the apartment while the mold guys work, right? Yeah. We're going to go to a motel. And we're going to tear into that mini bar! Yeah, we're going to go on a bender. No, we're not. Yes, we are. I'm going to drink some baileys and unwind. Hey, guys, stay with me. No. I mean... I appreciate the offer, but I... Listen to me. I live alone in an enormous apartment. That happens to be above a funeral home. Hmm. So, come on, stay with me. Ah, thanks, ! Yeah! Yeah, yeah! Linda, seriously, you want to stay in a funeral home? Why not? Yes, yes! It'll be fun. Is it spooky? You mean, do I have a medicine cabinet full of corpse moisturizers? Ooh! Yes. Do they make my skin soft as a baby? You decide. (Gasps) It's not greasy, either. Tina, touch. (Groans) Come on, go get your toothbrushes. Yeah-yeah-yes- yes-yes--yes!  Weekend at 's  we're gonna have a weekend at 's  eh, eh, eh  weekend at 's  we're gonna have a weekend at 's.  Follow me to your rooms. Urn... another urn... That's an award I won for "best urn." Okay, kids, don't climb on anything. Don't touch anything. If you do touch something, don't touch me afterwards. And don't play with dead bodies. Do you think he's gonna have skulls? What do you think he eats soup out of? Hey, do you think he's gonna have a drawer full of gum that he takes out of corpse pockets? 'Cause if he does, I want some. Shh. Here we go. (All gasping) Hey, I'm not horrified at all. Aw. Bob: Wow. I didn't know you were rich. Kids, off the furniture. Well, I get a lot of stuff cheap. Everything in here had someone die on it. Kids! Off the furniture! Your room's right down the hall. All right, kids, let's go. No, leave the kids. This weekend, I'm Uncle . You seriously want to watch my kids? (Various radio station signals) : Uh... (Chuckles) Yes. The whole weekend. This should be a vacation for you two. Oh, we can make it the honeymoon we never had. Sure. You know, I got the bed you're sleeping in because a man died in it. Making love. Huh? Good God. Mm-hmm. It's a haunted honeymoon. Woo-oo. Kids: Woo-oo! (Grunts) Linda: Two whole days off from the restaurant. Oh! I know. What are we gonna do with ourselves? Well, I know what I'm gonna do. First, I'm gonna take these off. (Zipper unzipping) Oh! These bad boys. Bobby. Hmm? You gonna slip into something more comfortable? And I'm gonna get these on. Oh, are those your, uh...? My lazy pants? Yes. Well, I guess they come off easy. And, uh, now I will get this guy out. Ah, uh-huh, uh-huh. And let the vacation begin. What the hell is that? It's my model. Since when do you do models? It's a hobby of mine, Lin. From back when I could still have hobbies. I just relax, turn my brain off and enjoy the thrill of the build. The bus from speed? Yeah, the bus from speed. I didn't even know you liked that movie so much. I never saw it. I don't like to see the movie until I finish the model. Hmm. Makes it more fun. Wouldn't it be more fun if we did something together, like, uh... Like couples manicures? Or couples waxing? You could get a man-zillian. That stuff is for people who are dating, Linda. We... we do other couples stuff. We couples-live together. And that's even better. You know what? I'm gonna go. Okay, good. Yeah. I mean, okay. Going to be all by myself. On my honeymoon, I might add. It's not our honeymoon, Linda. Hey, look! It comes with a little Keanu! Hi, guy. (High-pitched): Hi, Bob. Missed you, buddy. Oh, for Pete's sakes, you big freak. Bet you never knew washing out rubber tubing could be such a blast, huh, kids? Well, I had a feeling. Who wants to help me glue a toupee on an old man's cadaver? Yay! This is like camp. (Groans) Tina, what's bothering you? The wig or the cadaver? The cadaver. Wigs can be scary. You know what? Why don't you kids go ahead and take five? Explore the morgue. But stay away from my computer. Not because of p*rn. This computer? Come on, now. What's this? No... Tina: "A dating web site for icians." , you got a message. Yeah. Well, this lady and I have been messaging. I sent her a "wink." She sent me back a "kissy face." Kissy face? That's a big deal. You need to take this relationship into the real world, . Yeah, reality, . "Meatspace." Get into it. Nah. I'm not ready. Ah, you're right, . You're wh-what, 50? Wait till you're ready. 50?! I'm 35 years old! Huh? If you believe my dating profile. (All laughing) And... send. What? What'd you do? Wash you hairpiece, . You're going on a date. Oh, Keanu. (High-pitched): Give me long sleeves. Okay... why? You look great in a t. (High-pitched): I don't know. I just switch it up. Okay. No, no, no, make me one of those tuxedo t-shirts. Do that. That'll be funny. Well, that's stupid. I don't like those. Ah, I see you're still playing with your dolls. Mm-hmm. I just got back from a salsa boot camp. I was the lonely little salsa-ita. All by myself. (High-pitched): Eh, she's back. Hey, just be cool. Louise: Mom, dad, come quick! Oh, my God! What? What is it? What's wrong? Oh, nothing. This is just silly. asked a girl on a date. A date? It was the kids' idea. Yup. I proposed a romantic rendezvous for 8:00 P.M. tonight at the elegant Jimmy Pesto's. What? Jimmy Pesto's? What? I only know two restaurants. And they have cloth napkins. Don't rub it in. Calm down. Hey, she replied. Already? Too soon. Am I right? It's not a good sign. ", it's a date. See you at 8:00." She's a rhymer. Go, . I mean, it could be fun, two icians... Hey, what if you and Linda come, too? No. No... Yeah. A double date. Oh, but who would watch the kids? Right. Yeah. Tina can babysit. I can? Oh, come on. We're a little old to be babysat. Isn't that an outdated concept? No. Need I remind you what happened last time she was quote-unquote in charge? Free swim! Special delivery. (Coughs) Hobo dinner! Oh, pshh. We'll just be right across the street. Tina can call us on the emergency cell phone if she needs to. All right. You bought the ticket, you take the ride. Come on, Linda. We shouldn't go to this. It will be bad. Bob, we are going out tonight. All right, fine, fine. Yay! But just for a couple hours. And I'm wearing my lazy pants. Okay. And I'm gonna drink. A lot. Yay! Double date! All right! Linda (Laughing): Oh! I love it. I feel like we're in Jamaica! Ooh! Jamaican honeymoon. You be just in time for pasta-farian night with garlic dread-sticks, man... Stop! Groove with me to... Uh-uh! All right... No. You're such a jerk. Tina: I'm a born babysitter. Tina brings the fun. Now... sparkle. Hi, gene. Would you like to play a game? Maybe sing a song? Uh, Tina? Will you join me in the corner for a little powwow? Okay. You're dying out there, kid. Yeah. Everybody hates you. I know. I'm blowing it. Should I call for help on the emergency phone? Hold on. Maybe you should think outside the box. Okay. How many times in our life will we get a chance to wander unsupervised in a morgue? Yeah, won't that be scary? Tina, you don't babysit from here. You babysit from here. My boob? Yes. Your boob. Really? Yeah. What's your boob telling you, Tina? I don't know. (Muffled voice): Explore the morgue. Explore the morgue? That a girl! (Gene screaming) Sorry, just hungry. Bobby, they're playing our song. What? Our song isn't "ziti tonight." Oh, I think that's her! ? (Laughs) I recognize you from the picture on your web site. I'm Samantha. Well, it's quite a pleasure to meet you, Samantha. This is my friend Bob and his lovely wife Linda. Hi. Hi. We're on our honeymoon. Oh. Congratulations. Thank you. It's not our honeymoon. Well... technically. Not technically. First time to Jamaica. Oh, my God. Sorry for the smell. Long day slaving over the old embalming table. Well, let me just say that I've been embalming you with my eyes since the moment you walked in. (Laughing): ! (Chuckles) Ugh. Hush. It's their special language. Waiter! Do you have anything bigger? Come on, everybody! (Singing badly):  try our dessert  you gotta have a cannoli    Ooh, cannolis! Let's move. Oh, how thoughtless of me. Tina, I'm sure you want to go first. To protect us and stuff. Yeah, Tina. Earn that sweet babysitter cash. Wait, wait. First, how about a hug? Hmm? Aw. Come here, gene. Mmm. (Grunts) You're a good boy. Uh, weird. Hmm. All right, let's wrap this up. Okay. I'm ready. I'll go first. Like a lamb to the slaughter. Oh guys! I, uh... I forgot who sang "funkytown." I have to go look it up or it's going to bug me all night. You're not going anywhere. Aah! Keep walking, Tina. (Sighs) Are there bodies in those coffins? With all this green mold around town, better hope not. What do you mean? You're joking, right? Only that green mold turns bodies into the living dead. Uh... Tina, you're a zombiephile. You should know this! I'm not a zombiephile. I have a complicated relationship with zombies. They're dangerous, but I love their swagger. "Funkytown" is by lips incorporated. I just remembered. The morgue. Well, here goes nothing. Tina: Uh... (Laughing) Every time they say something horrible, take a drink. Bob, stop. I'm doing it. So, what's the weirdest thing you've ever found in a human body? Here we go. You first. Light bulb. A football. A far side calendar. Really? Huh. But most of the time, what I find is lots and lots of... Both: Tumors. (Both laughing) Aw. Already finishing each other's... Oh, my God, no. Linda. Senten... Stop. Sentence... Sentences. (Hinges creaking) How long does it take to open a door? Okay. Tina & Gene: Aah! Smells a little moldy. And corpse-y. Bad combo. I don't think we should be here. Yeah, let's go back upstairs. You're totally right, guys. (Groaning, rattling) It's locked. Tina: Louise, no! (Screams) (Phone vibrating) (Laughs) Silly us. It was only a phone. (Both sigh) Hello? Who is it? Some stranger. Hello? (Scary voice): Have you checked the children? Mom? (Sighs) (Scary voice): No. I'm a zombie. Oh. (Scary voice): No, I'm... I am also a m*rder*r! (Screaming) (Laughs) You go girl! You go, girl! Yeah, mon! Hey, I gotcha. Come on, dance with mommy. Come on! You drunk enough to be any fun yet? Yeah, I guess. Bob. Linda. Hugo, my man!   Linda, I can't do it anymore. Come on. No! I'm going home, Lin. To 's. Don't you ignore my lasso. Whoa, doggie. You got me. (Chuckles) Not you, Hugo! Fair enough. Fine, Bob. We don't need you here anyway, you big, sour blanket. Who wants to see what I learned today in salsa class? Uh, guess I can go finish speed bus. Then I can watch the movie. Hope it's as good as the model. (High-pitched): It is. Keanu... (Children yell) Kids! Kids! K-Keanu, where are they? Downstairs? (High-pitched): Yeah, probably. Thanks. Oh, I hate stairs. (High-pitched): We've been drinking, huh? You got that right, buddy. Oh, I feel like I could pass out. Anybody in there? Hmm. What is that, satin? Oh, man, that is calling our name, Keanu. (High-pitched): Get in there! Will do, buddy. (Groaning) Somebody close my bed. I'll get it. Unlock the door, Louise! We know you have the key. Nope. I ate it. We'll have to wait till it comes out. You never poop! We're doomed! Yep. (Snoring) What the hell? (Snoring) It's coming from the next room. She's messing with us again. No. I swear. I did this, but I am not doing that. (Snoring) I won't get fooled again. I am the babysitter. (Snorting) (All scream) (Snorting, wheezing) (Screaming loudly) (Yelling) (Pounding) Kids, stop doing that. It's me. Bob (Muffled): Stop hitting the coffin. Oh! Duct tape! Louise: Hit it! Smash it! I don't want to die!   (Muffled shouting) Let me out! Let me out! Now what? Now... We cremate it. Cremate?! No! No cremating dad! Bob (Muffled): It was a drunk nap! It's trying to sweet-talk us. That's classic zombie. All (Loudly): La la la la la la la... Open the casket! Kids: La la la la la la la... Kids: La la la la la la la... Kids, it's your father. For the love of God, kids: La la la la la la la... Bob: Let me out! Oh, God. I'm going to die alone. And I'm in my lazy pants. Linda hates these pants. Damn it, they're coming off! For you, Lin! Now what? Now we turn it on. How? Just pull all the levers. A lot. But they look like robot wieners. I know! Okay! (All grunting) It's not so bad. Keep pulling the robot wieners. Whoo-hoo! I love reggae. Don't listen to anyone who says you can't have a perfectly good honeymoon by yourself. (Laughing nervously) Hey, hey. I'm not done. I'm not done. Let me tell you something. I haven't known Samantha very long. But a woman knows when another woman is aroused. Whoo! (Both chuckling awkwardly) Tina: Turn that thingy while I pull this thingy. You don't know how! Let me! I'm in charge. Bob: All right, here it goes. Superhuman strength, you can do it! Oh, what happened? Tina: Dad? Dad? Uh-oh. Oh, my God! I'm going to die in here! Dad, I've got you. Bob: Oh, burning. Coffin on fire. (Gasping) Yes. Air. Kids, come here! Tina's in charge! Mmm. (Giggles) (Both giggle, then scream) Oh. Now you come off. What happened here? My shop's a wreck! . Lady ician. How's the date going? Good. Good! Are you okay, Bob? I've faced d*ath, . I know things now. I know. You don't just build the model of life. You... You watch the movie of life. You... You get in the mood and... Make some ician babies, you two! . Your name. Kids are amazing! Even if they try to burn you alive in a coffin, and they will do that. Kids: Yeah. But it's good. Because you see your whole life pass before you as you're burning. And every pair of pants you've ever worn. And you'll see the love of your life dancing salsa in Jamaica by herself. . And you. What is your name?! Samantha. Yes! That's beautiful! Are you two in love or what? Hopefully. Can I hear you say "yeah"? Kids: Yeah. Yes, we are. Yes, Bob. Yeah! That's great! Then, feel it! Right? Feel it! Love! I feel it! I feel it! Say "love"! Kids: Love! Love. Would you watch my kids for ten minutes? Sure. Good, I gotta go. (Door shuts) Nice embalming table. Is it disinfected? Uh... Tina, do you think maybe you could... Say no more. Gene, Louise, now! Ow, my ear! No, no, no! : No! No! No! (Screaming) : Wrong door. Bob: Hello, baby. Linda: Bob! Ah, disgusting! I can see your downstairs dreadlocks. Go ahead and look, Jimmy. No, mon. Yeah, mon. Oh, Bobby, you big goof. I took off my lazy pants. Did you notice, Lin? Yes, I did. Hugo: God! Care to couples-dance with me? On our haunted Jamaican honeymoon? (Laughs) That's green mold! Right there on Jimmy's wall. What? Do you see it, Lin? Right there. Linda (Laughing): Yes. Oh, crap. She's right. (Laughs) We win! We win! Ah, just put some bleach on it. What?!
TV weatherman: Ocean Avenue is gearing up for this year's Lobsterfest, and that mean ol' tropical storm we've been watching is movin' out to sea, which means perfect weekend weather! Ugh! Damn it! So if you think you hear thunder, it's just my stomach growling. (Laughing) Ha! I love Lobster. This guy is unbelievable. Stop pimping for Lobsterfest! And start primping for Lobsterfest. Mmm... (Making goofy sounds) Looking primpy. No, no primping for anything! Why are you so grumpy? Come on. You know why. It's no fun being a burger man in a seafood town. I hate Lobsters and their stupid fest. Plus, I'm allergic. No, you're not. Yeah. I'm allergic. Remember our first date? Yeah, I remember our first date. You were a nervous wreck.   I was having an allergic reac... never mind. Hey, what are you guys looking at over there? Um, nothing. Just pictures of people... Doing it. Oh. Hey, wait a minute. That's not p*rn. You brought a Lobsterfest brochure into this house? Can we please go this year? Absolutely not. Ugh! But there's so much fun stuff happening. Unveiling of the world's largest butter vat, for instance. The coronation of the Lobster queen and her court of lovely Lobster maidens. Entertainment by John van horton & the music extrusion. Mm. I do love those guys. As a matter of fact, gene, you were conceived to a jvh song. And I plan to return the favor. (Bell tinkling) Oh, great. I mean, hi, Hugo. You know, I couldn't help but notice, Bob, uh, yours is the only window on the street without a Lobsterfest poster in it. Yeah. Why might that be? Well, because Lobsterfest is stupid! What? I'll handle this, Ron. Put the sign up. It's the law. It's the law? Martial law. I'm grand marshal of the fest this year! Hugo, such a fancy sash. You look like sissy spacek in Carrie. Ha. Oh, thank you. But, Hugo, as a health inspector, you must know how disgusting Lobsters are, right? They're bottom feeders that eat garbage all day. Huh, they like garbage? Then they must eat here! (Laughs) In your face, Bob. And now in your window! Come on, Ron. Let's make like a Lobster and get the shell out of here. All right. (Bell tinkling) Hey, my two best customers! Two burgers coming up. No burgers for me, Bob. I'm saving my appetite for Lobsterfest. None for me either, Bobby. I just come by to show you my new Lobster cracker. Check it out-- titanium with butter-resistant grips. It's the one the astronauts used. Teddy, you think the astronauts brought a Lobster cracker to space? Yeah. That's what it says on the box. Look. "The one the astronauts used in space!" I spent $49 on this. Hey, I bet you kids are old enough to crack your own claws this year, right? We don't celebrate Lobsterfest. What?! We're like Jews on Christmas. Or Jews for Jesus on hanukkah. Or me at a lesbian bar. Last night. Watched a hockey game at a lesbian bar, Bob. It was like I was invisible. Uh... And who knows the name of the delicious paste that collects here in the pancreas? Tomalley! Correct. (Clears throat) Excuse me, miss labonz? Yes, Louise. My family doesn't observe Lobsterfest. I should be excused from class, and/or given an a. Thank you. Good night. Louise, I don't normally use this argument, but if everyone else is doing it, you should, too. (Thunder crackles, rumbles) Huh. Attention, students. The tropical storm has changed course and has been upgraded to a hurricane. It could hit town at any moment. Don't worry. We have an emergency plan. It's called "talking it through." Now, who here thinks the hurricane was caused by something bad they did? What about you, Nicholas? That thing you told me? In confidence? Say it. I rub my genitals on the couch. Mm-hmm. We're all gonna die because of you! (Screaming) It's weather only a Lobster could love, but sadly, there will be no Lobsterfest. This reporter is getting his bib off. Ha, ha! Stupid, failure weatherman, and your failed Lobsterfest. Where's your ugly red sea bug God now?! All right, hold hands. Come on, down to the basement. Bob, we have to close. A hurricane is coming! I know. Isn't it great? Lobsterfest is cancelled! So this town is gonna be crawling with empty bellies ready to eat Bob's burgers, baby! Bob, you're crazy. I think you're crazy! 'Cause it's crazy not to sell burgers during a hurricane! Bob's burgers is open for business! (Thunder rumbling) Oh. (Electricity buzzing) Is that all you got, storm? Wind chimes! Aah! (Angry muttering) Bob, I'm not sure staying open is safe. Suppose the hurricane tears right through here. I'll chance it! Look who I found trying to stay dry in the bounce house. The entire royal court of Lobster maidens. Oh, you poor things! Welcome, your highnesseses. Uh, you are henceforth known as the royal cows. Bob! Ah, well, something like that. (Laughs) I'll go throw on some burgers. Hot coffee coming up! I'd really rather get my lips around that beer tap. Hi, guys. Hey, Gretchen! Hi! Oh, Lobster maiden! Teddy, this is Gretchen. She cuts my hair. How you doing? Hey, are you still working nights at the cop bar? Nah, there was a groping incident. (Gasps) I apologized, but they fired me anyway. (Laughs) Oh, she's too much. Really is. Hey, you open? Mm-hmm. You got food? Yup. Beer? Absolutely! Atmosphere? Yeah... nnnn... eh... Ah, good enough. Whoa, Bobby. I think this might develop into a party type situation! You kids stay down in the basement. I already picked a corner for the bathroom. That one, where I went. And I picked that corner. Hey, we've got two bathrooms! Mom, I'm coming up! Linda: Just stay down there. They're gonna need you to help repopulate the earth when this is all over. Ew! You want us to mate with each other?! Linda: No, you'll mate with the other kids in other basements. Keep talking. All right! Jvh unplugged! Look at all that wet gray hair. Oh, Bobby, look at Hugo. Oh, and poor wet Ron. Yeah. Isn't it hilarious? Bobby. All right, I'll let 'em in. I just want to give 'em a pressed ham first. Stop it! Come on, let me. All right. Sorry for using all of your napkins. I want to thank you for bringing us in, Bob. It was totally Linda's idea. She is so damn considerate! You have everything, and I have nothing. God, so alone! Mm. (Slurps) Lobsterfest was all I had. And now that's gone, too. Look at me. I'm a joke! Yeah, that's too bad. Hey, Bobby, some of the Lobster maidens are open to the idea of a wet gown contest. Want to put up a prize? Uh, how about a towel? Ha! Oh, my God. That's so funny. (Laughing) Gretchen, have you, uh, met Hugo? He was gonna be grand marshal at, uh, Lobsterfest. Ooh. Nice sash. Ever take it off? Well, actually, on Monday, I have to dry-clean it and give it back. Uh, Hugo, Gretchen is into authority figures. Cops, firemen, even mailmen, if they have an important route. Oh, my gosh. So am I! What, you're into mailmen? Well, if they have an important route. I think what Bob's saying is, she likes a man with a badge. You have a badge. Hey, Gretchen! Huh? Hey, Hugo's also a health inspector. That's like being a food sheriff. This is my badge. Mm. Kind of small. You got a g*n? Uh, no. Actually, I'm not, uh... Mm. ...Licensed to carry a firearm. I do have a food safety thermometer, and it's very sharp. Pull it out, Hugo. Yeah, pull it out, Hugo. (Laughing): Whoa! Watch out. Here it is. Ooh. "Unsafe range." I like my pork a little pink.   (Humming) Gene: Tina, what are you doing? I'm working on my mating list for when we have to repopulate the world. Let me see. Gay. Gay. Mythical creature. Gay mythical creature. Mm. Good luck. Guys, we're wasting time here. We got to sneak out. Sneak out? But there's a hurricane. That's my point. We should be out there, in the wind and rain, looting! Looting?! So how do we do this looting thing exactly? It's easy. You grab anything that's not nailed down. Anything? Like this brick? It's yours. Free brick! Free quarter. Free phone numbers. Free seaweed. Gene, free plywood. Whee! Hey, Bob, the cash register won't open, and you're serving burgers so fast, I don't even know who to get an iou from. Relax, Linda. I'll take care of it. Ugh. Hey, hey, hey, hey, listen up, listen up. You're all my friends. And friends don't charge friends. The burgers are free, people! Everything is gonna be free! Bob, I thought the point of staying open during a hurricane was to make money! This is way more important than money, lin! Lobsterfest is dead. Bobsterfest k*lled it! Crowd: Long live Bobsterfest! (Whooping) Looting is hard. Ah, I think I'm getting loot glutes. This stuff sucks. Let's go home. Hello. What have we here? Maybe he's lost. Check his collar. Get him, gene! (Grunts) Looks like this little guy got into some office supplies. Yeah, those rubber bands don't look comfortable. You should take 'em off. Aah! This is our one chance to see (Gene yelling) What everyone else is talking about. What do you mean? Gene: Aah! We're gonna eat Lobster tonight! But that goes against everything we were raised to believe in! Aah! It doesn't go against everything. (Chuckles) Okay, but it's a start. Aah! Now's our chance to taste the forbidden fruit that has been kept from us our whole lives. Are you with me? Yeah! Okay. And one man's generosity has turned Lobsterfest into bobsterfest. We're trying to get a word with Bob himself here. I love you, Scott bags! Yeah, there's a cable on that. You can't go all the way over there. You come with me! Yeah, okay. You come with me! Can I... can I get my mic back, please? You come up and get it. Give me the mic! Crowd (Chanting): Bob! Bob! Bob...! Whoa! Oh, wow! This feels weird! Hey, bro. Did I hook you up or what, Hugo? (Whooping) Hey, where are we going now? Over here? Who decides which way we go? There's Linda, my wife! Hey, Linda, you look mad. Let's go the other way. Turn around. Bye, Linda. How you feeling, Bob? (Groans) What? Oh, my God. Lin! The restaurant's destroyed. The hurricane swept right through here-- we got hit! Actually, the hurricane missed us, Bob. It's beautiful out. (Birds chirping) You were the hurricane, schmuck! (Groaning) Hey, Gretchen. (Sighs) Do you have some sweat pants I can put on? Uh... Linda. I don't feel well. I can't even look at you. I don't feel well. I did this? You and the mob you incited with free beer and burgers. Oh, who bent my little spindle thing? That's what you notice?! Okay, lin, it looks bad now, but we made a lot of new friends last night. Once word spreads that Bob needs help, this place will be jammed again. The biggest problem is gonna be finding a job for everybody who wants one. Gee, I'm worried about this; I really love it.     Louise: Okay, technical problems from last night have been resolved. Hair dryer plus waffle iron plus toaster equals boiling water. So how do we k*ll this guy before we boil him? We could teach the Lobster to drive and wait until it gets into an accident. Or we could hire an assassin. No, idiots, you boil Lobsters alive. What?! That doesn't sound right. Yep. Until he's dead. And then we boil him some more. Here we go. Wait, this does not feel right. Doing it in a dark room with toilet paper around my neck? I thought my first time eating Lobster would be special. Deejay: And now please join Mr. and Mrs. Jimmy junior as they eat their first Lobster! Mmm, mmm... I thought my first time eating Lobster would be different, too. (Crowd cheering) People (Chanting): Gene! Gene! They're waiting for you in the hot tub, gene. Excellent! Whee! (Grunting) And the next day do it again-- same songs, different Lobsters. What's the matter with you two? Come on, Louise, is this really how you imagined your first time? Yes. (Sighs) Okay, not quite. Man: Louise, today you pay the super price for your super crimes. Enjoy your last meal. It'll do just fine... In a pinch! Aah...! Maybe we have been rushing things. I want to wait till I'm ready. Let's not give in to peer pressure. Let's release the Lobster back into the supermarket from whence he came! I guess you're right. Looks like this guy'll be the one that got a... whoa! Woops! I guess we're having Lobster. It was meant to be. When you get married, just pretend it's your first time eating Lobster. No problem. Emcee: Down it comes! This stunning butter sculpture, the likeness of Julia child, was made from every available stick and pat of butter within the local and outlying communities. Oh! And there goes Julia's feet! What?! Lobsterfest is back on? Hey, guys, um, you're not going to Lobsterfest, are you? Uh... Uh... I'm in kind of a bind, fellas. There's a mailbox in the middle of my restaurant. Oh! Can you mail this for me? Wait. Hey, guys? There he is, my buddy, Hugo! Hi. Oh, hi, Bob. Hi, Bobby. What are you both doing right now? My, uh, place, uh, happened to get destroyed last night. Oh, really? Yeah. In the middle of... Bob, I'm very busy. I have tables and tables of bisque to judge. Hey, I hooked you two up last night, and you guys kind of broke the baby-changing station in the bathroom. (Giggles) Slap him with a citation, Hugo. I want to watch. Baby likes civil authority? Yes, I love civil authority. I'll show baby civil authority. Stilts guy! You fell through my window. Lot of glass on the floor. Where you going? Got to go, Bob! If I stay still too long, I fall over! P-people! Wait! Stop! Wait! People! Do you think you can just ignore me?! Well, as far as accidental d*ath goes, this one was pretty tasty. Gene: I feel tingly. Do you feel tingly? I think he's having an allergic reaction. We should do something. Yeah, let's sit on him and see if he pops. (Both yelling) No, we should take him to Lobsterfest. They have a medical tent. And I could get more Lobster! Oh, pop! (Grunting) I'm trying! (Continues grunting) Emcee: Let's hear it for John van horton and the music extrusion! Uh, it's me. Bob! Bob. Bob. Bob. Bob (Chuckles): Okay... Settle down. Listen, what's going on here? What are we doing? Last thing I remember, you were all in my place and it was bobsterfest. I want to get back to that. Let's go back to that! Or at the very least, 40 or 50 of you come with me right now and help me clean up the restaurant! Not all at once. Man: Clean it yourself! Whoa, dad's on the stage at Lobsterfest. My eyes don't work. Paint me a word picture. Kids? What are you doing here? Nothing. What's wrong with gene? He looks horrible. He looks like he always looks. No, he doesn't. Does he? Looks like an allergic... (Gasps) Did you eat Lobster?! I, uh... He refuses to answer that. What's wrong with you people! Look at my son! Hello. You did this! You and your disgusting food fetish! Bob, get off the stage! You're disorderly. Oh, yeah? Maybe I should get disorderly with this Lobster pot here. That's right, you heard me-- you trash my restaurant, I trash Lobsterfest, starting with this Lobster pot. Ow! It's hot. Let's leave that alone. Oh, but I-I see some butter. You wouldn't like it if someone messed with your precious butter! Like stuff a big, hairy toe in it! (People screaming) Bob, put your foot back in your sock slowly. I'm authorizing myself to use my brand-new beanbag g*n to subdue you. Excuse me, I'm sorry, excuse me, excuse me. Bob! No! This isn't you! This is me, Linda! This is the me that they made! And look what they did to our son. That's not how he normally looks, is it? Bobby, listen to me. Excuse me, I'm sorry, oh... Bob: You don't have to keep moving! You're not a bottom-feeder, Bob! (Quietly): No, I'm not a bottom-feeder. I'm a burger man. (Sniffles) All right, I'm leaving. I'm sure that's what everybody wants. Oh, what happens if I-- oh, woops! Ow! (People screaming) Bobby, are you okay? Excuse me, uh, excuse me. Oh, my God! All the butter's been contaminated by Bob, and there isn't any more in town! (Screams) Bob destroyed Lobsterfest! Can't you just eat Lobster without butter? No! How? That's an outrage! Well, why don't you call it butterfest? It brings out the succulence, jerk! Yeah! So what should we do with him? Throw him in the shell pile! Shell pile? Shell pile! Shell pile! All (Chanting): Shell pile! Shell pile! Shell... Oh, boy. Excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Maybe Bob shouldn't have threatened your butter, and he definitely should have charged you for the burgers. Boo...! But he opened his beautiful heart last night, and you boiled it alive like a Lobster! All you're doing is making us angrier! (Muffled): Shell pile! All (Chanting): Shell pile! Sorry, Bobby, I used a bad analogy. Hugo, this doesn't seem right. What? I have a girlfriend; Bob's about to be thrown on to a shell pile-- I've had this exact fantasy. Ron: Come on, Hugo. If Bob hadn't been your wingman last night, you'd be another lonely guy in a satin sash. I was doing fine! I don't need a wingman! Oh, no?  Wingman  flying with the eagles  wingman  he's trying to help you out  wingman  wingman, wingman  wingman, wingman...  Agh! Damn it, Ron! Hugo: All right, attention, people! Stop it, everyone! Slow down! I'm the health inspector. Someone once told me that's like being the food sheriff. This vat of butter isn't contaminated by Bob until I say so! I have with me a dairy purity spectrometer. Oh... Now, give me some room. Give him some room! Thank you, Gretchen. Ow! You stabbed me! That's just epinephrine. You're in anaphylactic shock. Mm, you're a handsome shrimp. You just jumped to the top of my list. It's a mating list for when the world ends. Can I get your e-mail? No. I have finished my butter analysis. Bob's skin flakes, arm hair and fingernail dirt are all present. Crowd: No! That's disgusting! Let me finish! They're present, but not at threatening levels. The butter is grade c to d-minus. Fit for everyone except babies and people with compromised immune systems. In other words, get your bib on! (Cheering, whooping) Man, that was the best Lobsterfest ever. Yeah. Turns out people are hard on the outside and soft on the inside. Like, uh... Like, uh... Uh... Oh, I don't know, like a... like a crab. Yup. People are just like crabs. And we witnessed the birth of a new tradition-- every year on Lobsterfest Eve, we trash Bob's place. No, no, no, no. Right? Let's start now! (Grunts) Gene, you swear you didn't have Lobster? You've always looked like this? I was born like this. Uh, I need a picture to compare. Oh, my God, you do always look like this. Gene: Hello, gorgeous! (Sexy growl) Bob, Linda. Hey, Hugo. Where's Gretchen? She's a firecracker, that Gretchen. You sure she's not more than you can handle, Hugo? Gretchen just broke up with me. She said she was more than I could handle. Oh. It was ugly. She said she didn't mind a small badge, but said I didn't know how to use it, Bob! Ow. Ouch. Oh, that's too bad. I don't need your pity! So, here we are. Surprise inspection! Teddy: Oh. Pencil! Pencil. Pad! Pad. Ooh, bent spindle. Ron! Shut it down!
Bob's Burgers! Fresh ground meat! Great atmosphere! (guttural horn blast) Gene, bring it in. Get out of that burger suit. We're going. Baseball waits for no one. (sniffs) It smells like urine. Did you pee in that? I had to go! I told you not to pee in it after I cleaned up from the... I'm the only one who wears it. What's the difference? Oh, my God. What, you don't want to buy burgers from a guy who smells like pee? No one can place where it's coming from. I can't believe you'll close the restaurant to go to a baseball game. Louise, this isn't just a game. We bought an ad at the ballpark. That's worth closing for, right? Oh, can't wait to see it! It's gonna be so exciting. We're famous. It looks like a hot dog wrapper's stuck in the net. Like, a really tiny hot dog. I did think it was gonna be a little bigger. I think more people would see your ad if it was a urinal cake. Are you kidding? I wish I could afford a urinal cake ad. All this talk about cake is making me hungry. I'm gonna flag down the ice cream sandwich guy. Hey! Play ball! Welcome to opening day of minor league baseball. Let's hear it for your Wonder Wharf Wonderdogs! Please give a big Wonderdog welcome to Phe-Nom, the Korean bunt specialist! I never realized baseball had so much butt-touching. That's how they communicate, Tina. It's like Braille, but with butts. Read this! (groans) I'm bored. Boredom. Boring sports. Hey, it's the seventh- inning stretch. Time for the mascot race. Well, hello! Please welcome the owner of the Wonderdogs, Mr. Calvin Fischoeder! Fish! It's that time. Now cheer for your favorite mascot! Mr. Fischoeder owns the team? He owns the ballpark, the team, Wonder Wharf. I'm gonna marry that man. No, you're not. I wanna be rich! Don't be frightened. I have a g*n! So, get set... (fans cheering) Where has this sport been all my life? You know, I wear the burger costume all the time. Maybe I could race in one of these races, Dad. Bob: I bet it's impossible to get in, Gene. I'm sure you gotta know someone. You do. It's Mr. Fischoeder, our landlord. The winner! Well, I can't ask a favor of a guy I've never paid rent on time to. You're his son, Gene. He'll ask him. Yay! No, I won't. Now taking the mound to pitch, former major league sensation, Torpedo Jones! That can't be the same Torpe... Kids, that's the Torpedo Jones! I can't believe he's still playing. God, he, he must be... my age. I speak for everyone here when I say I don't know what a Torpedo Jones is. Let me tell you, nobody... We don't care. Gene, let me finish. Nobody... That's what I was trying to prevent. Nobody pitched like Torpedo. I was there for his greatest moment: "The Pitch!" It was 15 years ago, but I remember it like it was ten. His pitch was the split-finger skadootch. Torpedo clinched the pennant for us with that pitch. If he's so good, why have we never heard of this guy? Well, because he didn't last long in the bigs. You know, the skadootch is just one of those pitches. When it was on, it was really on. But when it wasn't... it's like hitting candy out of a baby's hand... with a bat. Wait. You mean it's hard because babies hands are so small? No, it's easy because... How could you hit a baby? Nobody would hit a baby's hand with a bat in real life. I don't understand. Was he fired from the bigs 'cause he hit a baby with a bat? I'm not interested in talking to you anymore. Sorry, Gene. I don't see Fischoeder anywhere. Let's get going. That's all right. I only wanted to do it really, really bad. Oh! There's Torpedo! Dad, ask Torpedo about the mascot races. Maybe he can get Gene in. Yeah! Kids, come on. I can't bother Torpedo. He's, like, my role model. Oh, that's creepy. Your role model is the same age as you? I would never have another nine-year-old as my role model. Hey, Torpedo! My dad is a huge scout for the Baseball League of America! Kidding. But he has a favor to ask you. (chuckles) Hi, I'm a huge fan. You know, I was there for "The Pitch." So, uh, what can I do for ya? Picture? Autograph? Three bucks each, both for five. Uh, yeah, both would be great. Dad! Oh, and my kid wants to run in the mascot race. You don't think... Hey, Russell! Some kid here wants to run in a mascot race. For you, Torpedo, I'll make it happen. I gotta free up one of these outfits. No, you don't! I got my own. It's a burger. Easy enough. Thanks a lot, Torpedo. Good luck out there, sport. Linda, did you, did you hear that? Torpedo Jones called me "sport." He didn't call you "sport," he called Gene "sport." No, he was looking right at me. Yeah, he called me "sport" and he tussled my hair. It was great, Gene. You were great. I'm a great tussle receiver. Wow, wearing the burger suit in the mascot race, Gene. That's advertising, huh? Don't touch me! It was so nice of Torpedo to give us these seats so we can watch Gene's race. You can really make out the players' tattoos from here. Tina: Makes you wonder about the tattoos we can't see. (quietly): On their butts. How you doing, Gene? You feeling fast? No, I feel queasy. Got some butterflies, Ace? Torpedo! Want my advice, kid? It's a mascot race; all you gotta do is stay on your feet. Let the other guys trip over themselves. It's time for the mascot race! Whoo-ee! Goodie. Remember, you're an ambassador for our restaurant, so just y y and run well, 'cause you don't run well. Good luck out there, sport. Oh. Yeah, I thought earlier you called me "sport," so... Nah, that was, that was a nickname for the kid there, Flash. I'll take Flash. Kids, call me Flash from now on. Let's split the diff and call you Stinky. Stinky! I like it! Oh, Torpedo, here's a little thank you for getting Gene in the race. I make burgers for a living, so it's not weird for me to give you this. I don't think it's weird at all, Bob. Like a good burger. Mmm. That's a good burger. Finish this guy back on the mound. Ha! Torpedo Jones just said I make a good burger! I want that on my tombstone. Seriously, okay? No, I already got your tombstone picked out for ya. What, what is it? It says, "Order up." (chuckles) That's good. Let's go with that one. Joining your Wonder Wharf mascots today is a special guest food, a burger! A boy who is also a burger. And I have my g*n. Ready, set... Go get 'em, Gene! I reinforced the crotch so he wouldn't tear it. Win, Gene! Avenge Dad's d*ath! Burt: Down goes Sammy Sea Lion! (making expl*si*n noises) Ooh! It's a two-mascot race! Burger and Captain Pel I. Can. There they go, like two, fast, fiery... bew...! (panting) The burger is your winner! (mimics trumpet fanfare) Well, congratulations, young burger. Ladies and gentlemen, you can purchase delicious burgers that look somewhat like him right here at the park. And at my family's restaurant. And, uh, what's the name of that restaurant? Ah... it's, it's... Bob's Burgers! God, I'm there every day. Bob's Burgers! It's... Oh, God... Gene! No! Never mind. Never mind. That's okay. Bob's Burgers! Oh, my God! You can get everything you expect from a burger at whatever the name of his restaurant is... Oh, oh, I just remembered! I just remembered! It's too late. But you can get them here at the park, today. No! Say it! I won something! I won! I won! I won something! Yeah, and you didn't fall down like everyone else. Tell that to your grandkids. I will. Gene, are you kidding me?! The name of the restaurant is Bob's Burgers! Well, I call you Dad! I think of it as Dad's Burgers! You live above it! You work in it every day! Bob, calm down. Calm down. Calm down. I'm sorry, Dad. I'm fine. I'm fine. He did great. You did great, Gene. A gold medal! Oh, we should get that bronzed! Strike three. You're out! Torpedo's split-finger skadootch has suddenly started clicking. I love that burger of yours, Bob. Hey, after the game, let's all go to Bob's Burgers! Whoo! Now that's advertising, huh? Ooh, Angel! Do they call you that 'cause you're such a good boy? I did many bad things to escape Cuba. Things that haunt me in the dark of the night. Aw... How about another beer? Man, you kids got a great dad, you know that? One wife. One family. That's the way to do it. You know, in the majors, most guys got a whole bunch of families spread out over the 50 states. When spring training starts, you get your Florida wife. When it's regular season, it's open season, if you know what I'm talkin' about. You kiss your home field wife and kids good-bye, you tell 'em you'll miss 'em, and you do. But you still take some of their toys and re-gift 'em for your away kids. I bet you're a great dad. And three great husbands. Mr. Torpedo, I couldn't help but notice that the tall boy was looking a little lethargic. Yeah, he's got Lupus or rickets or somethin'. I don't know why we keep giving that job to these sick kids. I was wondering if I could offer my services. I'm very healthy. (grunting) Okay, okay, okay. Whoa, whoa. Hey, you got the job. Just stop doing that. Here's your first ball girl duty: bringing me one of your dad's burgers before every gam Okay. Here's the tabacco you wanted. And your comic books. (speaking Spanish) Phe-Nom, is it possible to be in love with 25 people at once? (quietly): You're my favorite. Don't tell Angel. He's fiery. Strike three! (crowd cheering) Sound the alarm because Torpedo is on fire! (mimics alarm) Fire! Fire! Fire! Not a good idea, Burt. It's a crowded stadium. That Torpedo is amazing! Has he always been this good? No, he hasn't been good in a long time. He says my burgers have helped him pitch better. How does a burger help someone pitch better? Here ya go, Bob, little souvenir. (chuckles) Thanks, buddy! Whoa, slippery. It's greasy, huh? (sniffs) What does this smell like? Hey, stop sniffing Torpedo's balls. (laughs) Get it? It's like you're in love with him. (sniffs) Wait. That's our burger. Oh, crap. Torpedo's putting my grease on the ball. That's how his skadootch is skadootching so much. Your hero's using your burger grease to win. That's great! No, Lin, Torpedo is using my burger grease to cheat. Oh. So you helped Torpedo cheat. If that means the Wonderdogs keep coming to the restaurant bringing all sorts of business with them, I say big whoop, let the old man throw a greasy skadootch. Umpire: Strike two! (sighs) I don't even know what to think about this. I gotta go take a leak. Oh, get me an ice cream in a mini-helmet! Bob. You look glum. Oh, I, uh... You... don't hold your... when you pee. Why? It's not going anywhere. Okay. Um, well, what if you found out that someone you knew was doing something sort of bad, and you were helping them do that sort of bad thing... Is it me? Is it abortions? Wait. What? Uh, what were you saying? Torpedo Jones is greasing the ball, and he's using my grease to do it. Mm-mm. Oh. Come walk with me. Come behind the scenes! Torpedo's dazzling pitching is putting more butts in seats than this stadium can handle. Is the roller coaster going to be okay without those huge planks of wood? Sure, sure! These people aren't paying for extra wood, Bob. No one wants to ride Extra Wood Mountain. Whoa! Watch out! Extra nuts and bolts. Ow! People come to baseball games for the same reason they come to the amusement park: To be entertained! Does it really matter if the games are rigged? No! The games are rigged? Yes! Oh. My wonderdog is hanging out. (chuckles): Yes. Yes, it is. I got so caught up in our conversation, I forgot to zip. Yeah, I didn't want to say anything. Why not? I, uh... Compliments are welcome. Where was I? You were saying the games are rigged. Yes. The games are all rigged. I'm not letting my kids play these games anymore. But look at these smiling faces. Just like those smiling faces. Smiling at every skadootch the Torpedo throws. They don't want to know, Bob. They don't want to look behind the curtain. I don't know. It just seems like bad karma or something. Karma? There's no such thing as karma. (laughs) Not in this town. Oh, just kick 'em. Kick 'em right into the ocean! Okay. That's it. Wait, why does Tornado want our old grease in a jar? It's Torpedo, Gene. Oh. Uh, it helps him pitch better. And-And don't forget, it's a secret. Why? Is it against the rules? Technically, yes. So then it's cheating. No. What it is, is helping people enjoy baseball more. It's entertainment. I'm confused. Are you and Mom getting divorced? What? Oh, my God, you are. I call Mom! I call Dad! You guys took both of them. Enough. Go fill the condiments. I call ketchup! I call mustard! Aw... You can do horseradish. There's not... okay. Thanks, Bobby. Hey, who wants a burger? On the Torpedo! Hooray! Gene, you're defending your title. Are you nervous? Why don't you ask my diarrhea. You should be nervous. You're a chubby kid in a mascot suit. That's what I'm saying. I should cheat. Dad says it's okay when it's for entertainment. That's right! Let's cheat! You see that pelican? Gene: Yeah. You're running, right? You have a switchblade taped to your shoe. He does? He will. And on your other shoe, you'll have a lemon. Stab! Stab! Stab! Sting, sting, sting! "What are you doing?" "I'm squeezing lemon into your wound!" Sweet baby blade foot. Or... I can give him a nudge and tip him over. Ugh, really? Yeah. He's top-heavy. I'll just give him a little tippity-tap. Well, I'm still gluing a knife to my foot. (starter pistol fires)   Yay, Gene! Go, Gene! That-a-way, son! Tippity-tap. (grunts) Burt: Ooh! It's a three-mascot pileup! Go, Gene! All right! Go! Phil: The Boy Burger wins again! How about that? Burt: Hey, how about this, Phil? (makes whooping siren sound) I don't know, Burt. I'm not so sure about that. Yay! I won! I won again! My brother won! Guys, take off your shirts. (grunting) Good arm pumping, baby! That's how I disguised the push. What push? He pushed the Cotton Candy mascot so he'd fall over. Hooray for cheating! Gene, how could you? You know that's wrong. Uh-uh. Not when it's entertainment. You said it yourself. You told them cheating is okay? No, I didn't, Linda. Yes, he did. Oh, Bobby. Oh, crap. Go get me a soft serve. And make it a swirl! Look, Gene, when I said it's okay to cheat, I meant for Torpedo, not for you to cheat in your mascot race. You should really give back one of those medals. Ooh, but I want to get a picture of you wearing them before you do. I'm not giving back my medals! Those suckers got their money's worth, Pops. I'm good for business, Dad. You know what? From now on, there'll be no more cheating. Does that mean I shouldn't give Torpedo this grease? That's right, Tina. Yes. No more cheating for anyone in this house. From now on, I won't wear my tummy tuck jeans. And good-bye, Brazilian. Hello, rain forest. Sorry, Dad. But if I win tomorrow, I'll be the first mascot ever to win three races in a row. I'm a top! You mean you're on top. No. I'm a top! (groans) Shew. I was starting to think maybe you were going to leave me high and dry here. Well, what's in this jar is worth the wait. What the...? "You don't need to cheat. "You can win without me. "If you try your hardest, you've already won. Love, Bob's grease." That's right, Torpedo. You can win without my grease. It just took me believing in you. Now, listen. Gene's about to race, and since you're his role model, I'm hoping you'll tell Gene he can win without cheating, just like you. Who the hell's Gene? That's... my son. You're his role model, and you're my role model, too. Wh...? I can't be your role model; we're the same age. What's this mean? You cutting me off, Bob-o? Torpedo, I'm cutting you free. Come here. Wait, what are you going to do? I'm going to hug you. Slow down there, tiger. Guess I'll have to make this grease last the whole season. I should have never given you my grease. I created a monster. You think you started my greasing? I've always cheated, Bobby. Not the... "The Pitch." Oh, definitely "The Pitch." Torpedo: That game, I had a pat of butter in my nostril, s*x jelly in my armpit... Hell, I was on prescription drugs to stimulate production of earwax. And "The Pitch"? That was courtesy of some black market whale blubber I bought off some Eskimos. Cute note, though, Bob. Bit of advice: if you want a role model, pick an old guy. By the time you grow up, they're dead. (sighs) Didn't go great. Gene! I'm sure it was fine. Torpedo seems like a reasonable guy. Torpedo Jones wants you out of his seats this second. What a schmuck. Gene! Phil: It's the seventh-inning stretch. Mascots are lining up. All right, maybe I have an idea. Hi, fellas. I'd love to say a few words to my son, the burger, over the P.A. Excuse me. Uh... okay. Highly unusual. Doesn't matter. None of this matters. Gene. Bob (over P.A.): Up here. Jesus? No, Gene, it's your father. I'm up here. You're dead?! Yes. (gasps) No, I'm-I'm kidding. I'm up here in the booth. Right here. See me? (sniffs) Boy, this microphone smells like beer. Well, let's just say AA was "A" waste of time. Winning isn't everything, Gene. Yes, we're all here to be entertained, but if you, um, cut corners now, the next thing you know, you'll be hiding lard in your nose or taking wood out of roller coasters. Hey, all right, that's enough of that. Let's start the race! I'm trying to talk to my son. Gene, run clean. Burt: On your mark! Gene, what are you going to do? I don't know. You're going to cheat! That's what you're going to do! You're going to win by cheating! (panting) Who wants to see the burger win three in a row? (cheering) Gene, listen to me. You know what to do. Bob... triple crown for burger. Good for your business. See?! No, Gene! Don't worry about the advertising. What are you doing? It's a starter's pistol. It's a real g*n. You should get down. Bob: What?! Stop sh**ting! This is crazy. Oh, good. He stopped. He's just out of bullets. And down goes Cotton Candy! It's a two-mascot race. Gene. Do the right thing. Yeah. You can win on your own, Gene! Probably. (slow-motion): Hey... All right. Fine. (yells) Louise: Whoa, whoa! Don't push him! He was going to push you! Burt: Congratulations to Captain Pel I. Can! Oh, Gene. Sorry, buddy. I mean, looks like karma caught up to you. Bob, I told you there's no such thing as karma. Uh, yes there is. No, I'm afraid there isn't! I'm afraid there is. Is not. Oh, crap. See, Gene. This is what happens when you cheat. That was incredible! Cheating is amazing! (groans): Oh. Bob? Oh. Uh, hi. Sorry about your roller coaster. Ah, roller coasters come and go. But Bobs are once in a lifetime. I admire you. You do? You remind me of my father. He was honest, and he worked hard. You an immigrant, Bob? Um... no. Just swarthy? I guess. What's "swarthy"? Um, dark and hairy. That's you! And me in the future. Well, unlike you, my father made a fortune. But in many other ways, you guys are the same. Two decent, swarthy peas in a pod. One rich and one... just scraping by. Thanks. Well, we're off to get a massage. Come on, Wonderdog. Down, boy. He's gone, Dad. My future husband's gone. You drove him away! Tina, what you got there? The team signed a ball so I'd have something to remember them by. And I took this jockstrap. (chuckles): Okay, sweetie. Let's throw that in the wash. No. Come on, give it to me. Mm-mm. Do you know how many venereal diseases those baseball players have? I don't care. Whose was it? Smells like Angel. Angel. Tina: But don't tell Phe-Nom.
(Slow beeping) (steady quick beeping) Dig, Gene! (Gene yells, Louise sputters) Show me the treasure! Maybe it's some tin foil and we can recycle it. Maybe it's a shovel, and I won't have to dig with my hands. Look! It's a watch! (Coughing) Ollie? How long have you been down there? Where's Andy? He was supposed to unbury me. There you are! I've been digging all over for you! Is your brother around? He's over there playing with Zeke. Okay, Jimmy Jr., put me in a crotch-lock and see if I can get out of it. (Grunting) Zeke. This is why I'm only friends with women. Pull the key out! They're on the wrestling team together. Pull the key out! I could help you practice, Jimmy Jr. Tomorrow's good for me. Thanks, but me and Zeke are going to watch them demolish that taffy factory tomorrow. We're gonna watch it get blowed up. Boom! (expl*si*n noises) (Zeke and Jimmy Jr. grunting) Zeke: Scoop. Jimmy Jr: Ow! Ah! Tina, Gene, let's go. (Zeke grunting) We've got a whole beach to comb. Yes, sir. I'm good. Come on! Hah! (grunts) Teddy: Bobby, want to come over and watch the game tonight? I'm making a three-bean salad, but it's bring your own bean. Can I put you down for garbanzo? No. Nah, he can't. (Sing-song): Bob's got plans tonight. (chuckles) Yeah, Teddy. Um... Sunday nights me and Linda have, uh, you know, an arrangement. (Linda and Bob chuckle) Oh! Scheduled s*x. Eh... Do you want to borrow my Sade tape? And I found this on the beach. I think it could help me. Ooh. Passionfruit paperbacks. Juicy! Too bad you kids can't take the metal detector over to Caffrey's taffy factory. Find his secret treasure before they tear the place down. Whoa, whoa, whoa... ho, secret treasure? What are you, ah... What are you talking about? Whoops, there I go again. Divulging amazing secrets. Yeah, my Uncle Paddy told me about it. He used to work in Caffrey back in the '50s. He was his maid. Your Uncle Paddy was a maid? All maids were men back then. Until women joined the workforce and took all the maid jobs away. All right, girls! Go, girls! A big part of Paddy's job was dusting Caffrey's money. Caffrey didn't make his money from candy, you know. He was a bootlegger! I believe the term is leg-warmer. No it is not, Gene. Anyway, Caffrey ran liquor during Prohibition. There are tunnels under the factory where they brought the booze in with boats at high tide. And the tunnels were booby trapped to keep out the G-men... Louise: Lousy Feds. Teddy: Rumor is Caffrey even made a bunch of taffy dummies to guard his operation. Like the Terra Cotta Warriors of ancient China. China. Stick to noodles, right? Is that r*c1st? Yes. A little bit. No. Anyway, Caffrey didn't trust banks, so he hid all his gold down there in the tunnels. Mm-hmm... Uncle Paddy told me about it, and now I'm gonna tell you. There's a secret elevator in the factory that takes you down to the tunnels underneath. Uh-huh. Continue. Yep. Uh... You follow the tunnel around the curve till you get to three stones, and then you take the tunnel that bends this way, and there's the treasure! (laughs) It's a butt! Get it? A butt! With three turds! Eh, Paddy got me good with that one when I was a kid and now I'm paying it forward. Eh... Yeah, that's a... That's a great one, Teddy. (Faking laughter) Teddy (laughing): Gold? He was a funny man, that Paddy. Eh... A funny male maid. With a serious drinking problem and psoriasis. Kids-only meeting. Now. I'll get Mom. No, Ti-Tina! Kids! Listen, let's go get the taffy factory treasure! We've got the map! But it's just a butt! Teddy was just messing with our heads. Men do that. No, no, this might be real. Think about it. If you had the chance to make a treasure map in a shape... what shape would you make it? Butt. Butt. Exactly! The factory's getting demolished tomorrow, so we have to go tonight. You guys in? We doing this? I could move some things around. Let's find butt treasure! Oh. Well, I am done. No more chewing for me. Look at the time. Yeah! I'm gonna sleep like a baby. (Very quietly): A horny baby. Ooh. Ah... Great dinner, Mom. You outdid yourself. That was a great day all around. One for the books. I want to go to bed immediately before I spoil it and make it just a regular day. (Quietly): That was easy. That was easy. (Whispers): Gene, you don't need to do that. Their door is shut. I know. My belly itches. Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm. Louise: There it is, guys. Caffrey's treasure is as good as ours. And no one knows about it! (Bike bell rings) Louise: What is Jimmy Jr. doing here? I invited him. What?! This book is gonna be my treasure map to Jimmy Jr.'s heart. All I have to do is act like this damsel. Hey, Tina. Oh, sorry I got dirt on your leg. Oh, my. H-How will I ever get clean? Um, hose it off? (Whispers): Yes. See that fishtail, J-Ju? Zeke?! Jimmy Jr., you don't just invite someone without asking! Yeah! Yeah, we're in agreement on that, Tina! Okay, good. Oh, Tina! Whoo! What are we waiting for? That factory's got windows and I got a passion for smashin'. Heeyah! Anyone else coming? Just Andy, plus one. That's Ollie. We made it! I got a funcussion! Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. That one didn't hurt. Ow! Doofus, Brace-face, Dingle, Berry, Gas Tank, Blabbermouth. Just so you know, we're not sharing the treasure with you, you, you and you. Jimmy, the way the moonlight shines on your hair makes me feel so... vulnerable. Yeah... it makes me feel like... dancing! (Grunting) Yeah, J-Ju, faster! (Glass shatters) Abandoned warehouse! Pent-up feelings! Footloose it! Don't tell me not to dance, Dad! (Sighs in disgust) We need to find that secret elevator and get down to the gold. I can taste every flavor from the past 60 years! I can taste the Korean War! I taste rust. I taste Andy's spit! Come on! What? The elevator! This means Uncle Paddy was right! There's treasure down there! You're welcome. Tonight's gonna be a little special. I got a couple of surprises. Not Teddy's Sade tape... Dice? Sexy dice. We roll them and they tell us what to do. Okay. Um, sounds... sexy. Ooh, let's... "hug". On the... (gasps) "chair." So, you're gonna hug on a chair? Mm-hmm. Come. That's, uh... Come to Momma. Ahh. Oh! (Strained): Get off. Um... oh. Get off. There we go, that's better. Whew. So that's it for that. So how do we work this thing...? What's this one do? Ah. What's happening? It must be a booby trap! Pull a different lever! No rush. (Gene grunts) (screaming) Louise: Push the other way! Linda: Nang, nang, nang, nang, nang, nang, nang, nang... nang... oh, good ear massage. Uh. Oh, Bobby. Aang, nang, nang, nang. All right, let-let's see what we got next. All right? I'm gonna roll. Ugh. I got "lick" "foot" again. (Gasps) Lick it like you like it. No. Lick it like you like it. No more lick foot. Lick it like you like it. Lick... No more lick foot. This little piggy goes all the way home. Hey, let's give these dice a little help. Let's do this... and this. (Dirty chuckle) That's weird. Well, it's about to get weirder with this and this. No, it's just, do you hear the kids? Huh. They're never this quiet. I'm gonna go check on them. (Gasps): Aw! (Gasps): I knew he didn't take out the garbage. Tina. Bobby, they're gone! What do you mean, "they're gone"? They're not here. I got Tina's diary. Let's see if it says anything. Tina: Dear Diary, tonight we're sneaking into the dangerous taffy factory. Also, if boys had utuses they'd be called duderuses. (chuckling): Duderuses. Bob! They went to the taffy factory! We gotta get them! Really? Yes. All right. Bringing you guys along was a big mistake. Between you inviting half of the town, and you pushing and licking everything in sight like an animal... You guys are a burden... you are dead weight! What are you doing now, Gene? I'm being courteous! I'm using the fart escape. There's an opening there? Yeah. But it's full of farts. (Sniffs, groans) I can fit through there and shimmy down those ropes. I am ditching you dipsticks. Wait! We can fit through there too, and Ollie can see in the dark. And Andy knows all the capitals. Albany, Montgomery, Juneau, Phoenix, Boston, Montpelier, Helena, Boise... Brr, it sure is cold in here. I wish some strong, chivalrous man would lend me his jacket. Or pants... Ow. Wash 'em before you return 'em! (Rat squeaks) The treasure's in the crack of the ass, and it's close. I can smell it. Okay, I need one of you in front of me and one of you behind me at all times, in case there are booby traps. Booby, booby, booby, booby. Booby, booby, booby, booby, booby. Sph! Sph! Zip it! Zip it! Oh! Nice try, Caffrey. Would one of you be a lamb and pull that string? Oop. Oh. It was nothing. Was nothing. Well, that was probably more menacing back in the day. This thing's stuck. What should we do now, Jimmy Jr? You're smart. While you guys keep on blabbity blabbity blabbity blabbity blabbity, I'm getting outta here. Yeah. Yeah. You go. (Grunting) Come on, J-Ju. Saddle up! Okay. I mean, hell yeah! Let's do it to this! No! I... I mean let's all go! Come on, Gene! I just got comfortable. It took me five minutes to cross my legs. Now! (whimpers) Ugh. I'm okay. He's gone. I thought Jimmy Jr. and I would have a romantic night in the sewer together, like Fabrizio and Fay. Tina, honey, it's pretty obvious Jimmy Jr.'s not into you. And I'm usually not that good at picking up on vibes. Did you know Mom and Dad were a thing? (Moans)   Louise (echoing): Damn it, Ollie! Andy: I'm Andy. Louise: Damn it, Andy! Louise, which way did you go? Louise: Oh, you can't tell? That's too bad! Don't follow me! You'd just fall into every single booby trap that has ever... (Louise screams) Every single trap that's ever been what? Hm. Silent treatment. Kind of weird to start in the middle of a sentence, but whatever. Oh my God, Bobby, I hope we find the kids before they hurt themselves. Oh, oh. Quit poking me with that thing. I'm sorry. I can't help it. I don't understand... why is it still here? Well... I may have slipped a pen1s pill into your casserole. Surprise. What? Wh-Why? Sometimes you want to ride a roller coaster twice and you don't want to wait in line. That's crazy. Where... where'd you get it? Ginger. She does it with Tony all the time. I want to be edgy like them. Pill-popping s*x freaks. Well, what am I supposed to do with this now? That thing made the kids; Maybe it can find them. Where are they? You know, come on, get out of there. Come on. Where are they? Show me, girl. Wait. Why is it a girl? 'Cause it's a pretty brunette, like Catherine Zeta-Jones. Oh, crap. Andy! Ollie! Go get help! We're on it! Montgomery, Harrisburg, Las Vegas! That's not a capital! What? I couldn't hear you. Las Vegas is not a capital of Nevada. I didn't say Las Vegas. What'd you say? Oh, just go! Go! Don't tell anyone. Okay. Nothing to get freaked out about. My arm's not stuck in a crevice, so I don't need to cut it off like that impatient idiot. (Screaming) I just cannot stop banging things down here. The acoustics are great. Tina, what song is this? "Aqua Boogie" by P-Funk? Yes! Wow. Hey. Hey, you. Tough guy! You want a piece of me? Sticky. Are you made of taffy? Huh. There you go. Not so scary, huh, Taff? Just you and me now... a girl and her taffy giant. Classic. (Echoing): Louise! Nice echo. When I say Gene, you say Gene. (Echoing): Gene! Gene! Linda: Gene? Ugh. Is that what my voice sounds like? Bob: Kids, where are you? We're down here. How did you find us? Bob: Because... we're your parents and we know everything. Did you read my diary? Yes. Linda: Are you okay? Where's Louise? I don't hear Louise. We don't know. She ditched us, and then she ditched us some more. It hurt even more the second time. Bob: Uh, did you take this elevator down? Yes, but then we broke it. Well, we'll just jump down to the top and figure it out from there. (Both groaning) We figured it out. (Sighs) You okay? How's your pen1s? It's okay. Mine's a nightmare, if anyone's wondering. (Strained grunting) Taff, you're not helping. Squishy b*st*rd. Is everyone around me useless? I have to do everything? (Chuckling): Okay, I see. Another Taff tantrum, right on schedule. Big news... Taff is upset! Everybody gather round! Sorry, Taff. I didn't mean it. You said things, I said things. Friends?  Linda (echoing): Louise! I can't believe you snuck out, and I... I still don't understand why you guys split up. She went to find the treasure by herself because we're "a burden." Gene, what did I tell you about finger quotes? Not to "do" them. But ironic detachment is great. Nothing means anything! Jimmy Jr.: Hey, up here! Who the hell is that? We went to get help. (Groans) I got more blood in my head than a skeeter on a peter. Oh, my God. You really do. All right, hang on a... I'll get you guys down. Jimmy, you're looking well. I've been fine. Okay, where's Louise? And that's why I ditched my brother and sister. Don't look at me with your judgmental, hollow eyeholes. What?! Gene and Tina were a liability. This is a treasure hunt! This is a professional operation! You would have left them, too. Well, you weren't there, were you? If they're so great, how come they haven't found me yet? Huh? Huh? Huh?! Gene and Tina: Louise! (gasps) Down here! (Stammers, groans) Don't, don't, don't, don't! No one likes an I-told-you-so. Oh, thank God. We'll get you out, baby! Are you all right, Louise? We're fine! Who's "we"? Me and Taff! Let's just call the fire department, right? There's no service. I hate this freaking phone, Bobby. Lin, we're underground. You can't blame the phone. What, do you work for the phone company now? Bob's Phone Company? What, are you going to beat me up? Get me out of here! Sorry, Louise. Yeah, sorry. I have a cheap phone, so you're going to have to stay in there for the rest of your life. Your mother was arguing about the phone. Yeah, I did a walk-through. I did it twice. We're good. Louise: Get me out of here! Okay. Louise, calm down. Listen, you're not in any danger. (Rumbling, rattling) What was that? Oh, no. No, no, no, no! Oh, my God. Maybe it's an earthquake. Maybe the neighbors are just moving furniture around. We should probably pray. Uh, dear God, this is Tina from school. I just peed Andy's pants. Warm, warm, warm, cold. (All screaming) Oh, crap. They started the demolition! Hey, so my friend had a three-bean salad party, but it was bring your own bean. Who does that? Don't worry, Louise! We're going to get you out! How are we going to get her out? Maybe we should smoke her out. Louise, are you sure there isn't something down there you can use to climb out? Louise: Oh, wait! Here's a grappling hook! Oh, and here's an escalator! Silly me! We're about to die, Louise. Do you really want your last words to be sarcastic? Louise (sarcastically): No! I got it... let's all spit in the pit. Then she can swim to safety. Right, J-Ju? (rumbling) We're all gonna die! Stupid book. I'm sick of acting like a dumb, helpless girl just so a hot boy who dances his feelings will notice me. That's not who I am. I'm a smart, strong, sensual woman. Bob: Oh, God. Now, here's how we'll get Louise out. We'll make a ladder. Everyone, lock your arms like this. The person underneath puts their legs through, and you use your core strength to do the work. Um, my core is super ticklish, so... I don't know, Tina. Tina: No, it'll work. I saw Jimmy Jr. and Zeke do it in wrestling practice. Hey, those practices are closed! I'm aware of that, Zeke. I'm the reason they're closed. (rumbling) All right, let's try it. Louise, grab Gene's hands. Can't reach them! Nobody say anything... Louise looks really different. What is that? This is Taff. He's a booby trap that became much more than that. (Rumbling) Everybody run! Why is Taff stuck on Dad? Well, sometimes, when a man loves a woman very much... Oh, crap. Dead end? Ugh. If I'm going to die, I'm going to play "Aqua Boogie" one last time. Hiyah! Gene, not now. Wait. That sounds hollow. Hit it again, Gene, harder. Daylight! Everybody, through here. (Sighs) We made it. We're safe. (cheering) Um, lots of people out here. Whoa. Your s*x night took a weird turn, huh, Bobby? (Groans) Daddy! Andy? Ollie? Hey, I thought you guys were with your mother. You came for us! I'm just here to watch the demolition. You know, I mean, yes, I came for you. I'm a great father. (Boys grunting) All right, off, off, off, off, off. You're wrinkling my belt. You know what, Tina? Strong girls are hot. Put it on a T-shirt, Jimmy Jr. I don't want to hear it. Just when I think I'm out, those cheeks pull me right back in. Get off me, you wuss. Ah, looks like you finally got the starch out of your shirt. Yeah. Finally. Aw, what a waste. Well, we'll try it next Sunday. Please don't drug me again. We'll see. Tina, Gene, Taff made me realize I was a little hard on you two. I said you were useless dead weight, but I was so wrong. Tina, you got me out of that booby trap. And Gene, you actually banged us to freedom. I can't take all the credit. I'd like to thank this brick and Questlove. I'm sorry I was mean to you guys. Eh, I just figured you were having female troubles. (Whispering): What are female troubles? I love you, too, Louise. Aw. And, Taff, what are the words? I love you. You're going to live with me now. You're not taking that filthy thing home. Yeah, you're right. Well, I guess there wasn't any treasure. This butt was just a joke after all. Maybe the journey was the treasure. (Blows raspberries)  Teddy was right  About the treasure.  In the butt  The next day you will see  Taff is washed up on the beach  And oh, my God, is that a gold bar?  The wave just washed him out far  The kids didn't look close enough  In the taffy butt  You have a taffy butt  There's treasure in that butt  I want that taffy butt  Ay yi yi yi yi.  Taffy butt  It's such a taffy butt  There's gold there in that butt  Give me some taffy butt  Ay yi yi yi yi.  Taffy butt  Oh, I want the taffy butt  Give me, give me  Give me some taffy butt  Ay yi yi yi yi. 
 Linda: So, Bobby, what are we gonna say to the bank manager tomorrow? If we don't get those loans restructured, we're up a creek. Screwed Creek. Don't worry, Lin. I got it all worked out. Very convincing stuff. Let's hear it. All right. Action! (clears throat) As you know, sir, we have several loans with your institution, all "past due." But what does "past due" even mean, you know? It's brilliant! There's no such thing as time. Gene was past due and he came out fine. I wish I stayed in there! Hey. Get out of there. Gene! Let me in! Let me back in! Gene! Bob! Oh, God. This is your son. Sorry, Gene. No backsies. You can't put the candy back in mom's wrapper. You know, I have a savings account at First Oceanside. So I might have some pull over there. Thanks, Teen, but I think I got this covered. No. Look, I know we owe money and my credit score's on the low side, but... It is the low side, Bob. It's kind of an inside joke around here. Hmm. (laughs): That's funny-- but I would still like you to look at the loan. No. Well, it's really important that... Bob, I have to take this call. That's... not a phone. Well I... I still have to take it. Great. Well, then I will, leave you your piece of paper phone call. I just wish that you... nope. You know what, forget it! Um... I'm gonna leave. Hey, thanks, man. Whoa! Get a car, idiot! Gonna check on my money. The bank manager didn't go for it. (sirens blaring) And he was mean. My God, Bobby, what'd you do? Nothing. I just punched a cardboard cutout guy. I didn't even punch it, I just flicked it. Oh, Bobby. Man, I got to do this stupid essay for English class on "someone important to me." I'd write about the guy who flies the helicopter on The Bachelor. Look at all those police! This is a good time for me to be stuck in that tree again. Linda: Kids! Get in here! Gene: Channel six news. They'll finger anything with a pulse. I'm pretty sure their slogan is, their "finger's on the pulse," Gene. No! That can't be right. It's right. Linda: Ooh, SWAT team's here. Intense. That guy's important. You can tell by the way he points. (muffled shouting) He' s fingering right at us! Bosco: Tell those guys to get behind the barricade, now! There's a hostage situation at the bank. We need this restaurant. (whispers): This is, um, interesting. The restaurant will get on TV. I know. I was just thinking the same thing. That's a lot of coffee's going out. Write it all down, all the coffees, we got to keep track. Officer (on radio): Snipers are in position on the roof. Oh, God, that's embarrassing. Our gutters are a mess. Hello. My name's Louise. I would like to donate a piece of my personal chalk in case you need to outline a body. Is my money safe in that bank? What are these kids doing here! U-Uh, they're our kids. They, uh, work-slash-live here. Well, keep them out of the way. You got me? Do I have a hard line yet? Line's up. (heavy breathing) Who's breathing on my line?! All I know is I was just talking to Ken, and now I'm on hold at the bank. Hey! Everyone shhhh! God, we're making the call. Shut up. This is Sergeant Bosco, and I'm in charge. Uh, who am I speaking with? All right, Mickey, how many people you got in there? Eight. Okay, Mickey, this is what we're gonna do: You... Uh-huh. He wants pizza. Oh, come on. They always want pizza. Isn't there an ltalian place across the street? Jimmy Pesto's? Heard that place was pretty good. Get six pizzas over there quick. No. That could've been huge for us. I hope this standoff ends... pizza-fully. (laughs) Pepper-ono-he-didn't! Ugh, you believe this? Pesto is getting the free advertising we were supposed to get. (mechanical whirring) How does, uh... one get into robot driving? (gasps) Did you go to robot college?! Come on, give me your keys, Seth. (slurring): I'm fine. I only have to drive .37 miles. We're in college, dude. Chillax. (retching) (panting) Are you sure you guys are naked?! Totally. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.... (Gasps) Oh! Ugh. I was just performing routine maintenance. Doesn't anyone knock around here? Jeez. There's no such thing as robot college. Not yet! (g*nf*re) Officer: Shots fired! Shots fired! (gasps) Finally, some g*n play. Down in front! Thank you. That was the worst pizza I ever had! Jimmy Pesto's is crap! (laughing): Yes! (groans) Ouch. Yeah. I'm sorry about the pizzas. Um, what do you want instead? Chinese? Burgers. Mexican? This is a burger place. Louise: What about Hot Pockets? Burgers are right here. Or nonfat frozen yogurt. We're in a restaurant. It's my restaurant. Ooh! How about some sort of a Malaysian cuisine? Burgers. How about, uh... burgers? Okay, burgers it is. Thank you. Uh, fries, do they want fries? All right, Mickey, listen up. You want fries? Yeah, he wants fries-- and a what? And a what? Here, you take the order! Oh, okay. Uh, Hi. Hi. So, uh... b-burgers. How about cheese? How many we doing with cheese? All right, who wants cheese? Huh, everyone. God, what do I want? Man (whispers): I don't want cheese. Woman (whispers): Just scrape it off. Um... be-be-bo, be-be-booo. What does Mickey want? Wh-What's your favorite? Well, the burger of the day is, the, uh, "Chard to a Crisp" burger. What the hell is that? Oh, it's, uh... uh, burger with Swiss chard on it. I was just having fun with it. Look at you, Mr. Creative. No... a little bit. What was your name again? Uh, Bob. Bob! What if you brought the burgers over yourself? Uh... (whispers): Say yes. Say yes, Bob. Say it. (whispers): Please, I can't do that. O-Okay. Mickey: (laughs) Okay, Bob's in. Who needs these scumbag cops, right? (nervous laugh): Scum... Right? Yeah. The cops are really... Scumbags! Yeah. Well, no. You can say it. Scrunched up faces and their stupid arms... I'm gonna start on those burgers, okay? Why do I need to wear this? 'Cause you might get popped. I'm ready to be the man of this family. I'm ready to call you dad, Gene. No one's calling Gene Dad. GeneDad! Time to go. Let's move. Remember, Bob, he's hot, you stay cool. Hot. Cool. What are you?! Um, th-the guy with the hamburgers. No, no, no. What are you, hot or cool? Cool... oh, cool. You're ready. Okay. Come here, come here, come here. Come back safe, Bobby.All right? Let's go, Bob. I love you, Father! I know. Bob, let's go. (kissing) Hold on one second... Bob. Yep. Dad, if you die, I'll have to write rort on GeneDad. Timing is everything here, Bob. Let's go. No, if you die, I'll write my report on you. Okay, enough, Bob. I'm coming. I just gotta finish up here. Let's go now! Well, my family's saying good-bye. This is a precision operation. Dad, don't go! Don't go! I've changed my mind! Don't go, I love you! Gene, you gotta let go of my arm. Dad, I love you. Please don't go! Please don't go! Oh, my God! Get off. I love you so much. I' be right there, I've just got to wrap this up. Shake 'em loose, Bob! Let's Go! I'm trying! They're not letting me go! I have too many unanswered questions! What is s*x?! Gene, just let go! I don't know what s*x is! I said, I'm coming! Bob! Come back safe, Bobby. Don't leave me with these friggin' kids. (sighs) Okay, I'm going. Oh, crap. We don't have the logos on our bags. That's what's gonna be on camera. I'm on it. Why'd you draw at? It's not a rocket. It's a fish. Okay. Why would you draw a fish? It's easy to draw. So is a hamburger, or my name. Looks like a Jesus fish. Preachy. Let's go. Now. Move it. It looks like a huge, misshapen pen1s. It's Bob's Burgers. It's supposed to be a fish, not a rocket, or a pen1s. It's a pen1s. (sighs) (sighing): Oh, boy. Bob: Oh...God. Bob (groaning): Oh... no. Bob: Oh, boy. Bob: Oh, my God. Bob? Yeah. Hey, you are Bob. You are definitely not a cop. Okay? Uh... thanks? Here are your burgers. Hey, w-what are they saying about me out there? Uh, that you'd be, um, hot. Hot? Like Vin Diesel hot? N-No, like hot-tempered. Like a hot guy with a bad temper... So, here's the burgers. (two g*nshots) (screams) Bobby! How did you miss that?! Swat Sniper: Fatty got in the way. Uh, it's a code name we gave to Bob. You screwed up big-time sh**ting at me! Maybe I'll sh**t a hostage! Go ahead! Do it, big man! sh**t a hostage! You sh**t a hostage. Maybe I will! What is going on here?! You guys are trigger happy. No, we're not! (gunshot, screams, gasps) Are, too! What is wrong with you people? Stop this! Who is this? It's Bob. It's fatty. Look, Bob, we're gonna get everyone out of there safely, okay? I don't believe you! That was not on my orders. Someone just got a little hot. He's hot. We're cool. Remember? We're cool. We just sh**t sometimes. Okay, this is ridiculous. I'm coming outside now. Do not sh**t me! Whoa, whoa, whoa. If I let you go now, then everyone will want to leave. And it's a big domino effect thing. Bob's a hostage now. No. W-Wait, no. Hey, man, it's a really great group. Will you... close those blinds? Maybe we should pass those burgers around. My blood sugar is low. I dropped them. Hostages: What?! I was getting sh*t at. Speedo Guy: Drive through! That was gonna be my red meat for the week. What am I gonna do for protein? I've got a protein bar in my pocket. You can fish it out. (groans) I am so glad you joined the group, Bob. Oh, shut up, Frond. You guys know each other? What a coinky-dink. He works at my kids' school. We've had our... We hate each other. What? Oh, this is gonna be fun, you guys. He's taken Bob as a hostage. What?! This crazy! Yeah. Crazy good for my essay. Hello? Hello. You're on with Bob's youngest child, Louise. It's your daughter? Oh! They work with me at the restaurant. (sighs) Adorable. Yeah. Oh, no. You're such a good father. It's more about not paying regular--whatever. You want to talk to your Daddy? No. I want to talk to you. You have been selected as the subject of my important person school essay. Shut up. (laughs) Oh, don't tell me to shut up! Question one... What... It's my Daddy! Ah! How did you first get into bank robbing? Pfft. Me and a buddy of mine, we just kind of fell into it. You know, I had a g*n, I needed some money. All right, kiddo, we've had our fun now. Hand over the... It's my daddy! My daddy's in there! Yeah! Okay! So just a couple more questions. I know you're a busy guy. Give me the phone. Give me that phone back. Give it to me. You are being so rude right now. Ow! Ouch! Serves you right, kid. Listen to me, Mickey. We need to talk. No, no, no. You know what, I don't want to talk to you, I want to talk to the little girl. Negative. You'll talk with me. It's the girl or, you know, I sh**t somebody, I k*ll somebody. All right. Hang on. Hang on. (high voice): Hi, um... Listen, Mickey, you said you were a bank robber. Hey! I'm gonna sh**t somebody. Fine, here she is. This is Louise. I'm running the show now. Bobby! I'm worried about you. Who is this? Hey, it's Linda. Linda, hi. Who's this? This is Mickey. I'm a criminal. Hey, Nicky. How old are we? Don't worry about it. Ask about my money. Louise: Hey, Mickey, uh, my sister Tina's worried about her bank account. I have $87 in that bank. I heard 200. And I have just withdrawn her money for peace of mind, huh? Louise: Nice! I just brokered the release of my sister's money. You haven't brokered jack! All right, here's how we're gonna do this. (mechanical whirring)   Thank you! Hey, gimme that. No, no. I need that for evidence. I will punch you. And I will punch you! He will. I'm through playing games, Mickey! Uh, actually, it's Bob. Mickey wants me to handle the calls now. Oh. Bob... Yeah. All righisten, can Mickey hear this? No. He's... behind the counter, playing "banker." Oh, good, good, good. All right, now, listen very carefully. You are now my man on the inside. What? No. No, no. I'm just the guy who brought the burgers over, okay? No. Not anymore, Bob. You're more than a burger guy. (sighs) Now, listen, whatever you're doing at 6:00 pm, in exactly one hour, hit the deck. Hit the deck? What? Hit the deck. You've never heard that expression before? Yeah. I said "what"? Were you in the navy? No, I was not in the navy. Were you? Yeah. As a matter of fact, I was. But I don't want to go through my military history right now. "Hit the deck" means get down. Well, you don't have to be in the navy to know that expression. Just focus. Spread the word to the other hostages. At 6:00, on the dot, hit the deck. Wait, no. Listen, don't do that. Everything all right, Bob? Yeah, uh, no. Everything's fine, yeah. I just had a cramp. Oh, good. Then get over here and play banker. Come on, get in on this. Yay. You got a 50? Come on, I can break a 50. Um, I got a five. All right. Let's break Bob's five. One, two, three, four, five. We broke your five! Thank you. That was fun. You got five singles now. Olsen Benner here reporting from the hostage standoff, where tensions are high. I understand your husband is one of the hostages inside the bank. Yes. Bobby, if you're listening, we love you, baby. If you make it out of there, I will do anything, anything you want. Except that one thing. Us, too, Bobby. Anything. Most things, Bobby. All right, Mickey, you-you have to give up. You-you have to end this before someone gets hurt. I have a plan, Bob, okay? This is gonna go fine. I can help. I am a self-certified counselor, after all. You want money, okay. The cops want to k*ll you, sure. You have a g*n and might k*ll us. (sobbing) I am freaking out! What is your plan?! All right, I don't have a plan, okay?! This is the first bank I've ever robbed by myself, without Rodney. Oh, truth comes out. Rodney was the brains and you were the dead weight, I'm guessing. Why the hell would you do a job without Rodney?! You stupid idiot! Mr. Frond, shut up. He's right, I'm so stupid. No. I'm nothing without Rodney. Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid. Okay. All right, come here, come here. Sit down. (phone ringing) Hello? Dad, I need to talk to Mickey. It's an emergency; my report's due on Monday. Louise, please. I'm in a hostage situation. People could die. Ugh, I just want to know what the nuttiest thing he ever stole is? Bob, this is Linda. I don't know if you saw what I said to you on TV... What did you say? Anything. That's what I'll do for you if you get out. Everything's on the table, including on the table. Lin, Lin, stop. I have to go. Dad, I just remembered, I have an account there, too, and a safety deposit box. So I have about, I think a thousand, and then I just have, like, a lot of valuables in the safety deposit box. I'm sending the robot. How many extensions do you people have?! Four. All right, I'm hanging up. Mickey, listen, we-we got to start making moves here, okay? What if-- hear me out-- what if you release all the hostages... Ah. Yeah. No. You leave the money. Sure. Sure. No. You give yourself up. Why not? Why would I do that? Almost as good as your "what is past due?" argument. Look, I want to talk to Rodney. Man: Rodney, phone's for you! Hello? Rodney? Mickey! Hey, what's up? Oh, not much. (whispering): Uh, I botched a job, man. The cops are everywhere. What do I do? Are there cops on the phone? Yeah, but I'm whispering. Yeah, we can't hear anything. Go ahead. See? Oh, man. Rodney. Who the hell is that? Oh, just a little girl who's writing a paper about me. When you two were working together, what was the first thing you would buy after you stole all that money? You know, I love me a Cadbury egg, but I... That's my Rodney. Hey, Mickey, I don't know what you're up to, but count me out. Rodney! Rodney! Rodney! Easy, Mickey, calm down. Ah! Let me out of here! Women and children should be released. You're not a woman, Frond. I will tuck my junk so fast. Look, I'm losing it, Bob. Maybe I should make a break for it. Mickey, look, you're not getting away with the money. You have to accept that. I-I just don't think Rodney would... You got to stop thinking about Rodney, all right? You robbed this bank. So you need to decide how this ends, not how Rodney would do it. It's how Mickey would do it. Do the Mickey plan. I don't know what the Mickey plan is though. I just don't want to look like a total failure on TV. Cops touching my hair, laughing at me, pulling on me, grabbing m-m-my new jeans. All right, all right. So give yourself up, but on your r term. Look, I don't make a lot of money selling burgers, Mm-mm. but I do it on my terms. Mm, okay. All right, I'll turn myself in. On my terms. And here's one of my terms. I'm hungry! I want one of your burgers, Bob. Baby steps, baby steps, baby steps. Olsen: That's right, the hostage situation is moving to Fish Rocket Burgers. Say we go to your place, order up some burgers, I give myself up, on my terms. How you like my plan, Bob? Uh, it's not great. Pretty sweet? Uh, I think it's fair at best, Mickey, but it's yours. It sure is mine. Hey, what are you guys doing after this? I mean, not that I can come. Probably not. I mean, maybe I can. Hey, you guys are shoe twins! Look at your shoes. Easy. You're almost home, Bobby! Oh, God, now I have to do that. Bobby, I'll trade you that for two of the other things. Hey, hey, look at that. That's my ride. Gets great ass mileage. How are you still single? (whispers): I'm not. Oops. Hey! All right, we're out of the restaurant. I just don't get why we have to be in a huddle, too. So you don't fan out. Plus, we're in a huddle, and it just feels like it should be, you know, like a huddle thing. Pretty tight though. Looking good. Hey, I see you! Get in the bank or, you know, I start sh**ting! Ah! Okay, okay! We're going. See that? Yeah, this is how you go out in style. The Mickey way. Mickey! What advice would you give young people? Who's your hero? What's your favorite pig-out food? Stay in school, Superman, potato chips if I'm sad, chocolate if I'm bad. Louise, get out! You guys are amazing. Best human shields ever. Whoa, look out! Just kidding. Oh, my God, no, look out! I'm kidding. These burgers are good. This is great, huh? Look at me. Burger in one hand, beer in the other-- living life. This is how you go to jail. Yeah, and no one got hurt. Well, that, too. That, too. Hey, Bob, you know when they, uh, caught up to Rodney, they tackled him, and his pants came halfway down. He's splayed out like that, with his hands on his head, ass in the breeze. It's like his pants just kind of gave up. My pants are staying on. So thanks for that, Bob. Thanks for everything. Uh, sure, Mickey. (timer beeping) (coughing) The cops tear-gassed themselves. Love it! Oh, well done. That's the money sh*t. Goodie. (coughing) (retching) Ow, man, not my Sex-U-V! All right, now's my chance. N-No, Mickey, don't do it. Sorry to eat and run. Was that a cool line? Mm, not really. (slow motion): No...! (slow motion): Yes...! Run, Mickey! Not the pants...! (grunts) You see that, Bob? My pants are up! Ow! They're up! Yeah, I see, buddy. I see it. Dad! You survived! I did. Oh, Bobby, you're a hero. I don't know about that. You really stepped up today. Maybe I was wrong about you, Bob. Come by the bank tomorrow and we'll see about restructuring your loans. What the...? That's a dye pack from the bank. Uh, Mickey must have put it... Tsk-tsk-tsk... Oh, don't tsk me. I didn't... Mm-mm. Oh, come... Nope. Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. Didn't know you had it in you, Dad. I didn't steal the money. I believe you, honey. Kinda. Hey, Bob, why don't you go negotiate the release of some tomatoes from the walk-in? It's been two weeks, Lin. You can stop with the hostage jokes. (chuckles) (phone ringing) Bob's Burgers. Bob! It's Mickey! Hey, Mickey, how-how's jail? It's horrible. Ask him if he got the books on tape we sent him. Does anyone there need a pen pal? Ask him what he'll do for a pack of smokes. Hey, Bob, I wanted to know what grade your daughter got on that essay about me? Oh. Um, he wants to know what grade you got on that essay you wrote. Oh. I never even turned it in. Right. Uh, she got an A. Hey, we got an A! (inmates cheering)
Feel your uterus curl into a smile as you stretch deeper into Crowning Otter. (Grunting) Ugh, Crowning Otter... it's so graphic. Lin, why do you do this prenatal yoga? You're... I mean, you're not pregnant. Your youngest child is nine. I like it. It keeps my pelvic floor perky. Ah! (Cracks) Ugh. Ugh. Hey, Mom, when you're done polishing your pelvic floor, can you check my math homework for me? There's nothing on here but a drawing of a robot. Who's better at math than a robot? They're made of math. Oh, Mom, did you have a chance to finish reading Buddy's Rainbow? (sighs) I did. The ending was so sad. Ah, this... remind me how it ends. Buddy dies, poor doggie. Write it down. Write it down. At least he saw the rainbow. Oh, he did? Yeah. Louise, did you read any of the book yourself? I could read it, but I retain it better when Mom tells it to me. Lin, we've talked about this a thousand times. You can't keep doing the kids' homework for them. I'm not. I'm helping them. What about you, Tina? Is your mother helping you do your homework? No. See? But Mom's been logging her dreams in my dream journal for English class. Great, you're dreaming for her. Oh, last night, I dreamt I was breast-feeding Gene again, and he had a long white beard like Santa Claus. Oh, it was freaky. (Gasps) That could be our next Christmas card. Well, Teddy, I finally did it. I got a soft serve machine. I knew you could do it, Bob. You just need to believe in yourself. Yeah, and summer's coming. This thing is going to be a gold mine.   Teddy: Bobby, where'd you go? Huh? Stop daydreaming. Let's have some of that ice cream. Okay, here we go. First bowl of a new era. Oh, ugh, nasty. Give it here, give it here, give it here. Don't throw it out. No, no, I wouldn't eat that. Just give it to me. It's not ready yet. Give it to me. (slurps) Ho-oh-oh. Wow, that is something there. As your first customer, I can tell you, you don't change a thing, you know. Teddy, you'll eat anything. What? I won't eat anything. I'm pretty discerning. Eat this. What was that? Don't feed a guy a sponge, Bobby. Don't feed a guy a sponge. You put it in your mouth, Teddy. (Groans) Louise, guess which one of us ate cat food. (Andy and Ollie exhale) Ugh, both of you. We brought it from home. See you in P.E. class. (Groans) I'm sick of P.E. So am I. Me, too. I hate the whole shirts and skins thing. I'm not open! I'm not open! I hate Ms. Schroeder's dumb rules. I told you, Louise, no hats in P.E. And I told you, I have a raging staph infection under here. Touch this hat and we all go down. You want to play dodgeball in the hospital? I hate how I always get hit in the head with the ball. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. I don't want to go to P.E. anymore. Both: Me, neither. Let's swing by Mr. Frond's office. He's highly suggestible. You guys, when I'm in P.E. class, I feel like I'm not living up to society's warped image of fitness. I feel like a loser. I feel like I'm not being valued as a woman. Me, neither. I need guidance and counseling. I'm a guidance counselor. Come in. So you're feeling a little P.O.'d about P.E., huh? (Chuckles) But physical education is a state requirement. I can't just let you out of it. But, what if, I don't know, instead of class, we did an independent... study in something sort of physical, something, like, I don't know, that the school doesn't offer. Independent study... I like the sound of that. Sounds like something I'd come up with. You just did. Yeah. You did. Nailed it. Uh, I guess I did. The superintendent is going to love this idea. So, what would you do for your independent study? Uh, swimming? Synchronized swimming. No, she doesn't mean what she says ever. Or just regular swimming and splashing. I love synchronized swimming. Who doesn't, huh? Yeah. I mean, okay, yeah. Great. All right, so, uh... you'll need an adult to supervise you. We know an adult. We definitely know an adult. Have 'em sign this. Louise: Linda Belcher... fancy on the "B"... definitely signed this form. Tina, synchronized swimming? That is the most random sport in the world. How'd you even come up with that? Mom loves synchronized swimming. Don't you remember during the last Olympics? She made us do everything synchronized. And brush and brush and brush and spit. Good. We just got out of P.E. for the rest of the year, my friends. Yeah, who needs it? (Straining) Phew. Here, let me try. Huh. I need to exercise. First, you fill the base of the cone. Boring. Just let me do the demonstration, all right? So the ice cream goes on the inside of the cone always? It goes... yes. It's like an edible bowl. We get it. Move on. Wait, if that's ice cream, why is it soft? Oh, my God. I have a question. Why are you telling us this? Because I'm going to need your help. You guys are going to be running this thing. Oh. I now pronounce you Team Soft Serve. I made a soft serve this morning, so I should be captain. Linda: Kids, time for school. Here, I washed your gym clothes. We don't need gym clothes anymore. Tina, of course we do. What, are we going to run laps naked? (Both laugh) (chuckles) Oh, and Gene, here's your Navajo warrior mask for your history class. Wow, Mom, great job. (Sniffs) It smells like you. I've been wearing it all morning. I love it. (Breathing heavily) Thanks, Mom. I hope we get a good grade. (Door opens, bell jingles) Hmm, uh-uh-uh. Don't you make noises at me, you judge-a-roo. Go play your judge-eridoo. Uh-uh. Ah-ah! Louise (chuckles): Suckers. Louise, why aren't you in P.E.? Do you guys have lice? I do. I do. For your information, we don't do P.E. anymore. We do independent study, thank you. Yeah, we're off the grid. So long, balls. Boy: Heads up! Ow. Ow.  Headin' out of P.E.  Gives us time to play on the street  First we lied to Mr. Frond  Now we're in a nail salon...  On.  Mr. Frond, pretty yarn. Do you knit? You tell me. (Chuckles) What up, my knitta? So, let's talk synchronized swimming. Oh, yeah, I'm always up for that. Big commitment. I bet. I still have the '96 Olympics on VHS. The Miracle on Melted lce. Ooh, I have Dynasty on VHS. Well, I can't wait to see the routine you choreograph for the kids in independent study. Independent wha...?! Those little sneaks. I can't believe they lied to Mr. Frond like that. Ah, here you go, sir. And they used me in their lie. What do you expect? You coddle them too much. Well, I'm not going to coddle them this time. I'm going to get real tough. Louise (sighs): What a day at school. I feel so physically educated. Hello, kids. I had a very interesting encounter with Mr. Frond today. You did? Yeah, he's an interesting guy. Yeah, he is very interesting, Tina. He's so interesting that he told me about your independent study. Uh... I got to go. I have forgot everything outside. Sit down. I got big, big news for you. You're not going to get away with it, either. Dad, do you want some help with the soft serve? Get over here. Look at this face and remember it because it's the face of your new synchronized swimming coach. (All gasp) What? Lin. Huh...? I guess we actually have to do synchronized swimming now. Tina, this is the woman who chewed your food for you when you had your tonsils out. We're not going to have to lift a finger. Okay, you two, lift your fingers. Synchronized swimming starts at your fingertips and ends with your tippy toes. I like it! It holds things in, in all the right places. Why is Gene wearing a girl's suit? 'Cause, otherwise, we wouldn't look synchronized. All right, everyone in the pool. Come on. (Both blow whistle) Whistles are for lifeguards only. Sorry. Thank you. Mom... I mean, uh, Coach, before we dive in, maybe we could watch you do a few moves. We're visual learners, right, guys? Yeah, like Jennifer Beals in Flashdance. She had to watch a lot of welding before she got good. I love Flashdance. Okay, I see your point. This is called the eggbeater kick. Nang-nang-nang-nang-nang-nang- nang-nang-nang-nang-nang-nang... Looking good, Mom! I'm learning a lot from looking! See, not so bad. I could get used to this. Hi. Hello. How are you? I'm fine. How are you? I'm good... not drowning. That could change. Please don't lean on the... Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you. Be right with you. Here's your ice cream, Teddy. Bob, this is too cold. Can you just put it in the microwave for me? I can't do that right now, Teddy. It's too cold. I can't eat it. Just eat it as is! I can't eat this. Oh, my God. Just warm it up for me. Teddy, you're k*ll*ing me. Come on, take a second. Give me the ice cream. Give it to me. Don't put it on too long, now. Excuse me. Can I get a sample of the chocolate? Why do you need a sample? You don't need a sample. But how will I know what it tastes like? It's chocolate... it tastes like chocolate tastes. Is it nonfat? Um, no. What percentage of fat is it? I don't know. Is it two percent? I don't know. You should get it melted. Can we get a sample of the melted? You won't be sorry. Teddy. What? Stop. Uh, Bob... I think my medium rare burger is turning into a well done situation. Oh, crap. Bobby, take it out of the microwave. Bobby, take it out of the microwave. I'm cooking now, Teddy. Bobby, take the ice cream out of the microwave. We're back. Lin, you can't keep the kids this late. I need you guys to be here. Here, Teddy, there's your bowl of melted ice cream. Oh, the bowl is hot. I can't do burgers and ice cream by myself. Dad's freaking out. I'm not freaking out! Totally freaking out. Shut up! Okay, shh, shh, shh, shh. I'm gonna go change. Me, too. I'm not. How was swim practice, Lin? Good... the kids will be ready to get in the water any day now. They haven't gotten in the water yet? They're visual learners, Bob. It's a scam, Linda. They're not playing a sport. They're playing you again. Look, soft serve. Oh, God. All right, here's a sample. I want vanilla. Do you have strawberry? Swirl it. Swirl it. Look, we don't do swirls or sprinkles or strawberry. Swirl it. This is not low fat! Oh, my God. Just spit it out. Spit it. Spit it. You're my best friend. You're my best friend. All right. All the teenagers leave! Little Leaguers, too! I ate some of that sponge. I want a sponge. Out! (Grunts) Gene, boogers. (Snorts) That is good stuff. Uncut. Kids, down here! Time to work on scissor kicks. Today, we're going to actually do them in the water. Gene just ate, Mom. We could get a cramp. What are you guys doing here? Mr. Frond made us independent study kids, too. Whee! We could use more people for a pyramid lift. Or we could make a circle. (Gasps) Concentric circles.   (gasps) Ooh. Hey, Linda, I like the choreography. You're a great coach... a beautiful, sensual coach. (Gasps) Thank you, Tom Selleck. (Kids laughing) Kids, stop! Stop! Stop! Whoo-hoo! Yeah! Marco. Wahlberg. (blows whistle) No whistles. You know that. I know the whistle rule! Fine. Please don't lean on the chair. What's wrong with you kids? Don't you care about your independent study? No. Louise said this class was a joke. Yeah. Say something funny. Louise, Tina, Gene, get over here now. Ah... good one. Cannonball! That is it! Your father was right. You're just taking advantage of me. You and Dad were talking about us behind our backs? Not cool! If you don't care about your P.E. requirement, then I don't, either. I quit! Looks like somebody's ready to coach independent drama. Where are you guys going? The pool's that way. Screw the pool. Without our mom around, we make the rules again. Oh! Am I glad I caught you guys. I have very exciting news. I pulled some strings, left several persuasive voice mails. The upshot: The superintendent is bringing the school board to the pool this afternoon to watch you synchronized-swim. What?! But our mom quit. Ow. They even suggested doing a graded performance. We're going to set up a judges' table. It'll be like the Olympics. Mr. Frond... ha!... we should not do this. The whole point of independent study was so that we wouldn't feel judged. You're judged from the day you're born till the day you die. The school board wants to see you do scissor kicks and perfect lifts. Otherwise, you're all going to summer school. Summer school? (Screams) What am I going to wear? I'm glad you finally quit helping the kids, Lin. It was the right thing to do. You were right, Bob. I needed to let my baby birds fly... my bratty little baby birds fly with their crappy little wings. That was... Sometimes you just got to push 'em out the window. Yeah. You just got to push 'em right out there. And if they fall flat, then that's them. Well, you know what, it's nice to have you back. It's nice to be back. Hey, you want to train me on this thing or what? You bet I do. All right. Yeah, you put your... Okay. ... put your hand on the knob. Yeah? Like that? There you go. Yeah, no. Like that? Slow. Slow. Ah, slow, slow, slow.  Oh...  Yeah, there you go. Ah.  My love  My darling...    Oh, hey, Tom Selleck. (Linda babbling) Uh, Linda, take it easy. Oh! Oh! Whoo. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Yeah, you can't pull it down that hard. Okay. Mom, we're really sorry. Will you come back and help us right now, please? Hmm. Stay strong, Lin. All: Please. I accept your apology, and I will help you. What? Great! Let's go. I will help you by not helping you. Right? Mmm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. What just happened here? Why is everyone smiling and not helping? Mom, Mr. Frond is making us perform for the school board this afternoon. Not my problem. Exactly. Not her problem. It's not my problem. Yes, what she said. Not mine. Okay, let's not... And if we don't pass, we have to go to summer school. Summer school? Yeah. What next? Summer church? Summer dentist? Summer visit Grandma? Summer camp? Wait, I'd go there. You guys made your bed, and now you're going to have to swim in it. Whoa, whoa. Lin, the kids can't go to summer school. We need them here in the restaurant. I thought you said quitting was the right thing to do. We both said a lot of things. Just, you help them. I will not, you hypocrite. If you want to help the kids... you're such a know-it-all parent... then help them yourself. I'm done. Yeah! Dad, help us! Yeah! Help us, Dad! Please. That's a great idea! No, no, no. What? No, not me. Yeah. Yes, you. No, I'm busy. Dad. Hmm? Summer School. And you're here all alone without Team Soft Serve. It's too cold. I can't eat it. What percentage of fat is it? Swirl it. Is it nonfat? Take it out of the microwave. Uh, Bob. Swirl it. The bowl is hot. Totally freaking out. Swirl it. No! (Sighs) Okay, fine. I guess I'll have to figure out some kind of routine. I taught you kids how to use this, right? Yeah. But I still don't understand where the ice cream goes. All right, shut up. Forget it. Superintendent Douglas, let me get your chair for you. I got it. I got it. Yeah. Ah. Once upon a time, there was no such thing as math. Until one brave teacher said, "Hey, what about math?" I think independent study synchronized swimming will be the next math. We are so screwed. We're all gonna die! Let's die like we were born... two minutes apart! All right, everybody, calm down. Huddle up. Come here. We can fake our way through this. We'll do a few of these and some of this. And maybe we'll be okay. Dad, go change into your suit. I'm in my suit. Hmm? This is what men wear, Gene, in the pool. Well, it looks ridiculous.  And five, six, seven, eight...  (fire alarm ringing) Fire! Oh, my God. Everyone stay! Phillip, it's a fire alarm. No, we're... we're at a swimming pool. This is the safest place to be during a fire. False alarm, people. False alarm! Everything is fine. Let's get this swim going!   And five, six, seven, eight... Anthrax! Run for your lives! Aah! Anthrax! Anthrax smells like babies! Oh, my God. Aah! Phillip, what is going on here? Come over here. Come here. (sniffs) It's-it's just talcum powder. Carry on. Ugh. Linda, it's Tom Selleck. Tom, what are you doing in my coffee? Want to know what's the sexiest thing about you? My ankles. No. You're a fantastic mother. Oh. Anything else? You always do the right thing. All right, we're done. Go. Get out of my coffee. And five, six, seven, eight... Doody! Doody! Oh, come on! (whistle blows) Everyone out of the pool. We've got a code brown. Don't go near it. It's disgusting. You did a Caddyshack? Nice move. What's a Caddyshack? The movie... Caddyshack? Never heard of it. Wait, so you didn't just throw a candy bar in the pool? No. Oh, my God. Yeah. Wow. Looks like a candy bar. Thank you. Mine looks like chicken satay. Sorry, folks, we got to drain it. I think we're done here. Next time, let's stick to the curriculum. No! No. No. We are not done. We will... we will still do this. We will... do this in the empty pool. You want us to swim in a pool with no water? Are you insane? Summer school.  And five, six, seven, eight.  (All grunting) (awkward chuckling) Ow! Sorry, Dad. (Door bangs open, whistle blows) It's Mom. Lin, what are you doing here? A little cup of coffee told me to come. I don't know what that means, but we're glad to see you. We're dying here. Follow my lead! Crowning Otter! Clench that pelvic floor! (Grunts) Gene, you're good. I've seen her do it a million times. And into Downward Stork. Don't forget to breathe. Here comes the baby. (all grunting) Push... and push. (All grunting) Oh, oh, it's crowning. It's crowning. Aah! I had a baby! And lift up the baby. (Imitating crying baby) Nurse the baby. And jazz hands. (Awkward chuckling) We passed! Yes! Next time we do this, I'm getting an epidural. Well, the school board k*lled independent study. Another Frond innovation in the crapper. But we passed the performance? I guess, technically, you passed. So no summer school? Yeah. Yeah. No summer school. Whatever. (all cheering) Whoo-hoo. Yes. Whoo-hoo. But you do have to go back to P.E. (All groaning) Balls. I got to go knit this out. Nice job with the prenatal yoga, Mom. Sorry we were such jerks. That's why I quit being your coach. But I'll never quit being your mommy. You saved our asses. And toned our Kegels. Let's go home and celebrate with some soft serve! Eh, let's go to I Scream, You Scream, We All Scream for Yogurt. They've got more flavors. I want to go to Chilli Billy's. I think they just serve chili. Ooh, now I'm hungry for chili. Good, 'cause we're getting chili. All right! Are we just going to ignore the fact that Louise pooped in the pool? Ignore it? I named it... Jezebel. Aw. My little grand-doody.
(video game music playing) That's the song I want to lose it to. Mm-mm-mm! This is exciting, right? A video game, right here in our restaurant. Yeah, I used to be pretty good at this game, too. By which, I mean best in the entire school. Wow. Yeah. We would not have been friends. I think we would have, Louise. I was very cool. I'd be your friend. I don't care if nobody likes you. It's him or us, Tina! Uh, I don't know. Don't make me choose. Yeah, I think this could bring in some real business. Maybe enough that we can finally get that new vent hood. Oh, or we could get sailing lessons. Or we could buy gift cards. They're as good as cash. No. We could buy an island. No. And then a smaller island nearby, for farting. Did somebody say sailing lessons? That's a great idea! You said that. Oh. Okay, let's not get ahead of ourselves, all right? Fart island. Sailing lessons. God. (Video game music playing) Look out! Ketchup bottle. Agh! GENE, LOUISE and TINA: Ooh! I know, I know, the ketchup's a k*ller. But I got on the board. 80,000 points! B-O-B... one. "BOB1." Hey, Burgerboss! You play? Ah, a little. All right. (sighs) Yeah, you like how these fingers feel, hmm? Yeah, you do, don't you? Huh? Yeah, I bet you never had someone this good. Aw, you make me feel like a king. Jimmy, my kids are right here. Ooh! Please stop, we're just leasing it. Jimmy: Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap. Yeah. Oh, yes. Oh, your corners are so smooth. Mm-hmm. Ooh, something to hold on to; I like that. (Sighs) You got over 300,000 points! Ah! Dad, what was your score again? Never mind, Louise. What was it though? Mm-mm. See you, Bob. Call me next time you find something that you think you're good at. Oh, hey, almost forgot. Mm-mm-mm-mm. Huh. (Gasping) Bob: Oh, ha-ha. "Bob Sux." That's, uh, that's really funny, Jimmy. (laughs) Then, you know, when I beat your high score, I'm gonna write, "Jimmy Pesto is an idiot "and he doesn't know how to spell 'sucks.' And he's dumb!" Dad, he's gone. I saw. Okay, enough is enough. He's not gonna taunt me on my own turf, Lin. Okay, you know, I'll just unplug it. Maybe that'll erase the high scores, right? Yeah. (Video game music playing) Ah, that didn't work. You know what? I'll take care of this myself. All right, well, hurry up. It's the kids' night to do the dishes, so we're gonna have to do them all over again before we go to bed. I'll be right up. This won't take long. Just gotta... (knuckles cracking) shake off the rust. (Crickets chirping) (video game sound effects) (birds chirping) (sighs) Come on. Linda: Bobby? Uh-huh? Could you take a break from that and help me with the grill? Yeah, yeah, yeah. One second. No, this second, Bobby! You played that thing all night. Are you kidding me with that pickle?! (Grunting) I saw that! Oh, Bobby, is this turning into another one of your peeing races with Jimmy? It's not called a peeing race, Lin. It's called a pissing contest. Well, you know how these things turn out. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Mm. Eh? (Grunts) How about this?! Nuh-uh! Hmm. I'm telling you, Bobby, you should learn to just ignore Pesto. Hey, kid, back off. I feel your breath on my hip. I did it, Lin! Kids, come look! Did you beat Jimmy? What? No. I broke 100,000. Fantastic! (Whispers): Was it obvious I don't care? Just smile and nod. Well, I'm on my way is my point. Linda: What? Again? I can't stop now, Lin. Not until I can erase "Bob Sux." What's wrong with your hand? Nothing. Oh, my God. Oh, God. Redrum. Redrum. Uh-oh, Bob. You better go easy. You could have the carpal tunnels. It's just a cramp. I must be dehydrated. (Grunting) Ew. This can't happen now. Maybe I should see a doctor. Good. Otherwise, I might have to stop playing. Ugh! Gene: Please tell me they sh**t webs. Are we finally getting a falcon? I think they're flattering. Like wrist corsets. The doctor said with these splints and these pain pills, I should be good to go. Oh, he didn't tell you to lay off the game? No! I can tell when you're lying, Bob! Whenever you lie, your eyes get crossed a little. The doctor said the last thing... Look, they're crossing. I'll just shut them. Ready? Okay. He said the last thing you want to do is stop playing. You're so full of it. What's gonna happen if you can't use your hands? Yeah, how are we gonna do our hitchhiking across America trip? Who's gonna play harp at my wedding? And how will we become a famous father-son close-up magic team?! (Door opens, closes) Lin? Oops. Overslept. Well, might as well take two. Morning, babe. Sorry I got to bed so late last night. W-Where's the game?! The game is gone! Bob, calm down. I got rid of the game. What?! Why?! Look at, look at me. It's an intervention. You have a problem. Yeah, yeah! I do, Lin! "Bob Sux" is on the game! And I need to get it off! I'm gonna track down that game, and I'm gonna knock "Bob Sux" off the board! Okay, Bobby, okay. I'm not leaving any stone unturned, Lin! They're all gonna be turned! All the stones! Okay. Look at me. Look at me. Happy times. I'm furious! I had the video game company take your game away because I love you. Mm-mm. It's like the time you took away the credit card from me when I was ordering all those porcelain babies.  If you're not real  Then how come I feel this way?  Little babies.  Come here. (Kissing) Come here. Aw, little baby. (Kissing) Linda, listen very carefully. What? Where did they take the game? Miles away by now, Bobby. Just forget about it. Where?! Where did they take it?! You're spitting on me. Wait! Wait! Stop the truck! That's my game! Genie's out of the bottle now. The whole world will know "Bob Sux." This isn't over, Jimmy. I'm gonna find that game. And when I do, I'm gonna wipe that smirk off your... Damn it. Check Family Funtime. That's where old games go to die. (Slowing down): Bleep-bloop-bloop-bloop. That's the sound of a game dying. (Music playing) Ah, there it is. Burgerboss. No adults allowed without kids. Oh, come on, buddy. Why can't you just let me play the game? Hmm, I don't know. Because I'm an adult and, oh, guess what, so are you. Well, I have kids, sir, all right? They're just not with me. So I'm gonna be playing... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm gonna need you to go ahead and step away. Well, I just forgot my keys, so... (gibbering) I forgot, I'm a cop! Let me in! I know that trick, too! That's my badge right there! Let me see that badge. No, I know it's not a badge! Well, you better believe I'll be back! Not without children, you won't! There he is. It's nice to have you here for dinner, Bob. Sorry, Lin. Hey, uh, I have to do a thing. With the kids. What? We have a thing? Yeah. But I don't have anything planned until my birthday next year. You're taking the kids out? Yeah. Well, it's, um, it's a secret. For you. Oh! I love secrets. Tell me! Well, this wouldn't be a secret if I told you. Does it have anything to do with jazz? Mm, maybe. Oh! No, no, it's not jazz. (Gasps) It's sailing lessons! You were listening! What? Right, yes. Sailing lessons! Sailing lessons. That's... How did you guess? Oh! This is going to be very good for you children. You can join the yacht club. White sweaters around your neck, the gin and tonics, shoes without socks, private fireworks. Kapow! When do the classes start? Um... Ba-boom! Tonight, in five minutes. We gotta go. Come on. Anyone else think it's odd our first sailing lesson is at night? No! Probably a lot of class work before they let you out on the boat. All right, we gotta go, come on. Let's go learn how to tie knots. Tying knots! Yay! I'm gonna stow away in a rope bin and fight a rat over a block of cheese. If we see any mermaids, I'm gonna ask them where their mer-ginas are. We're not taking sailing classes, you rubes. Where are you really taking us, Dad? All right, here we are. Whoa. Family Funtime? Now, if that guy asks, you're my kids, okay? We are your kids. I know, but rub it in his face. Excuse me, my kids and I would like to come in. We were made by this guy. Yeah. He had s*x, then we happened! Deal with it! I was wrong about you. They're beautiful. Gene: Thanks! Here. What is this? Oh, that's one token. That's a token. Okay, and then more. All right, have fun. And then more? Have fun. We need more! Can't. Gotta go. We can't play any games with one! Ugh! We could go around and look for interesting throw-ups. There's one. There's one. I've got a better idea. You know what's free? Loading. Freeloading. Let's go crash that kid's party. Oh. Oh! All right, uh, who needs a piece of cake? Who wants a piece? We do! Cake, please! Thanks, that kid's mom. Um, how do you know Kevin again? Soccer. Church. Desert Storm. Nice move. Thanks, kid. Do you mind? You're kind of crowding me. Ketchup, top left, in three, two, one. Whoa. How'd you know? Well, I don't want to crowd you. Are you D-R-L? It's pronounced "Darryl." D-Darryl, don't go. I-I need your help. Whoa, what's wrong with your hands? Polio? Carpal tunnel. How old are you? Old. Do you have a job or you live with your mom? Job. What's your job? I have a burger restaurant. Really? Is that so you can get better at the game? It's unrelated. Listen, I need to beat this high score, but I can't get past level 29 and that stupid chicken leg. What the hell does a chicken leg have to do with hamburgers, anyway?! Easy, easy! Ow. Damn it. What's your name, anyway? I'm Bob. Of "Bob Sux." Ouch. Who did that? A guy. Jimmy Pesto. I hate him. I got a bully, too. His name's Tyler. Picks on me every day. Oh, that's cool. So, will you help me? Sure, step aside. No, no, no. I gotta do it myself. I don't know, man. Your technique's sloppy and your stance... why are you standing way back? You got to press your wiener against the game, like this. See? Yeah. Okay, all right. Wow. Oh. Yeah. Wow. I'll teach you, if you beat up Tyler. How old is Tyler? He's 12. Well, uh, we'll see. Okay. I can't really shake, 'cause my... You want to just maybe E.T. it? God, I almost want to beat you up. Kevin: This isn't a bar mitzvah! I'm not Jewish! Kids:  Hava nagila, hava nagila...  Ahoy, there, mateys! So... what knots did you learn? Knots Landing? (laughs) Oh, my God. They learned a ton of knots, right? Mmm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Uh, absolutely. Tina: Yeah. A lot. Like what? Uh... the fish noose. Yeah. Linda: Ohh. The walrus's surprise. The... cake and ice cream. Ooh! That one sounds complicated! When do I get to go sailing with you guys? Oh, uh, soon, Lin, soon. Ooh! I can't wait! I'm gonna start putting my hair up in a ponytail. Why not pigtails, Mom? Twice as classy. I'd go with a flat-top... but, hey, it's your head! Time to take my awesome pills. Am I glowing? I feel like I'm glowing, Darryl. (Echoing): Hi, Bob. Oh hey, Burgerboss! (Echoing): Lookin' good. (Chuckles) Thanks. Are you high? No. You kidding? A little bit. Yes. Video games and drugs... those two things don't mix. Shut up. You're not too zonked to beat up Tyler, are you? No. Who's Tyler? Who's Tyler? Tyler's my bully! He could show up at any time! Come on, Bob, focus! Right, right, right, right. Let me just take one more pill. Happy Birthday, Samantha and Margaret! Our names are Jennifer and Kyrsten! We're always mixing you two up. Hey, Dad, get in on this pizza! No pizza! He's in training. Hope you get your lost manhood back, Dad. Take good care of our father, strange nerd! No funny business. I'm not a nerd! I'm a video game enthusiast. ('80's style rock song beings)  Close to the top!  See that? Now notice this.  Groping for glory, yeah  I know...  Yes.  Sometimes in life  You just gotta say I don't give a damn  Ha-ha!  Groping the night away, yeah  sh**t your arrow in the sky  Tell the gods you'll never die  You're a real special guy  The towel's there, but don't throw it in  If you do, you cannot win  That's how rules work    (screams)  Crawl up the mountain on hands and knees  It's stained with the blood of your enemies  Groping for glory...  I've eaten nine birthday cakes, and I still feel empty. I mean, who are these people? Who are you, who am I? I'm calling it. This party is dead. Okay. Let's go. There's gotta be something bigger we can crash. (Gene growls) Glencrest Yacht Club. I'd crash that. I don't know if I can have any more cake. What about crab cake? Hmm, I could make some room. Hi, I'm here for the orphan benefit, Tots Without Yachts? I'm the orphan. I'm Whit Worthington's ward, Wayne. I'm here to change the lightbulb in the lighthouse. Wait. What? We're gonna breeze right past you now. Thank you. Gene: Mm-hmm-hmm. (Indistinct conversation, laughter) Wow. It must be yacht prom. This is the Commodore's Ball. You know what? Just give me the tray. And make some mini pizza bagels. Thank you. This is for you. For your effort. There are more of these tickets where that came from. So keep this guy happy. Ow! Time to reload. This goes in here. And this goes in here. Oh, my God, oh, my God... Tyler's here. This is not a drill. Tyler? My bully! W... Wait... What're you doing? What're... Don't. This will make you look tough. And this will make you feel tough. Hey, Darryl, I don't have a lot of shirts, so don't do that. Oh. I thought your arms would look bigger. Let's put these back on. Oh, lookie what time it is. Punch-thirty. Nice one, Ty. Say something tough. Say something like "punch-thirty," then attack them all. Uh, hey, guys, listen, all right? I'm an adult. And it's, uh, it's gonna get kind of heavy here. Hold on, I forgot the bicep band. Okay, punch his face! What the hell, man? I'm not punching any faces, okay? I'm gonna talk to the faces. What are you doing, Bob? Kick his ass! I got it, Darryl. Look, I know you, right? You're Tyler. And you have fun beating up Darryl, here, all right. But Darryl, he doesn't like it. And let's be honest, there's a race thing going on here. Darryl, you're something... right? Black? That is not the issue. I beat him up 'cause he's a nerd. All right, I got an idea. Hold on, I'm just gonna take a pill. Mmm. Darryl, I want you to smile. No. That's good. And Tyler, I want you to also smile. No way. (Whispers): I'm so high. Okay, now, guys, just touch... touch your smiles together, okay? This is going really well. So now that we got that... (snoring) Bob? Bob? Bob?! Your bodyguard's asleep, wuss. (Grunts) Ow! That's for standing up for yourself. (Gasps) Chicken leg! Aah! What're you doing? Yeah, Bob! Unleash the beast! No mercy! Ah! Relish hole! Run! This guy's crazy! Fantastic. Not my problem. Thanks for coming to Family Funtime. Drive safe. (Humming) Bob: Chicken leg! (Thud) Ow! I fell down. Help! There's a crazy man chasing me! Yes! Tomato slice! Take that! (Screams, car alarm whoops) What do you think those are for? You get one for every octopus you k*ll. I'm taking one. Can I have that? I wish I'd met you sooner. I wonder what you looked like 15 minutes ago. Dad! Some hairy guy's trying to k*ll me! Burgerboss is gonna get you! Oof! Hi, Dad. Bacon-wrapped scallop? Sure. (Phone rings) Hello? Hi. Is this Mrs. Belcher? Yeah. Security Guard: I'm calling from Glencrest Yacht Club. Ooh! We need you to come down here right away. (Gasps) Okay! (Humming happily) Moisten the mizzenmast! What? You know what I mean! That thing. (kids grunting) The mizzenmast! All right! (Linda hums happily)  Three-hour tour...  You must be Linda Belcher. Yeah! How'd you know? Your family's in the trophy room. Follow me, please. Trophy room! (Slurping) (quietly): The mayor is here. Hi, Mayor! (Sighs) I'm glad you made it here so quickly, Mrs. Belcher. We need your help with... this. (Gasps) (grunts) Get away from me! What the hell's going on here? It's the Commodore's Balls. Your husband just barged in here. We caught your children stealing food and regatta pennants. And oyster forks. (Grunting) Princess Mayonnaise! We'll go back to back! Let's fight our way out! All right, someone better tell me what the hell's going on! Is this sailing class? Uh... Dad was using us to get into Family Funtime so he could get better at Burgerboss. Now he's in a k-hole. He tried to make me kiss another kid! You deserve it! Who are you people? Who the hell are you? I'm Tyler's father! And the president of this club. Ooh! Oh. Why didn't you tell me this was going on? We were kind of busy, partying our nuts off. Yeah, we were at Family Funtime. Partying our butts off. I said "nuts"! You know, I'm so disappointed. This whole time, I thought you were taking sailing lessons. (Crowd laughs, scoffs) Oh, shove it. Judge me. Jimmy: Ah, hello, Linda. You're a member here, Jimmy? Soon. Top of the wait list. I forget, uh, you guys members? (laughs) All of this is because you went and wrote "Bob Sux" on a video game. You. Aw, you're right, Lin. Let me see if I can help out, huh? Bob sucks! (Yelling) (laughs) Jimmy, you're just as pathetic as Bob with your peeing races. "Peeing races"? What are "peeing races"? That's not going to go over well with the membership committee. Sounds like a s*x thing. It does. But... (stammering) Aw, come on, guys! Come here, you! We're leaving, you pill-popping liar. Ow. Ow. Come on! Ow. Your mini pizza bagel, sir. I don't even want it anymore. Hold on. Yes, I do. Lin, I'm really sorry I lied to you. And did drugs. And used your children. Use it or lose it, right, Dad? You know what, Bobby? At the end of the day, it's for the best. Can you imagine being on a boat with those people? Yeah. I mean, if we were gonna have to be banned for life from someplace, I'm glad it's there. Yeah, the caviar was too salty. Well, technically, caviar is salty, Gene. Yeah, but I think they salted it on top of that. They're idiots. (door bells jingle) Oh, hey, Darryl. Hey, Bob. So you're the video game coach? And you must be Bob's wife. She does have big boobies. (Chuckles) What?! Yeah, okay. (laughs) I might have said that when I was high. Well, I came by to thank you. 'Cause of you, I'm not gonna let Tyler bother me anymore. Really?! I decided I don't want to be like you, a 60-year-old man, still battling his bully. (Clears throat) Okay. Uh, I'm not 60, by the way. But, uh, I'm glad I could help. And you know something, I'm all right with Burgerboss having "Bob Sux" on the leaderboard. Aw, I'm proud of you, Bobby. Yeah. Mm. Come here. (Quietly): Hey, you're gonna knock "Bob Sux" off the leaderboard, right? I'm on it. Good. Just change it to "Fat Bob." "Dumb Bob" works too. Or "Hi, Bob!"
I got a visual lock on sandwiches. Where? One o'clock. 1:00? But I'm hungry now! Tina: Are they ice cream, or regular? Louise: Both. Gene and Tina: Whoa. Keep it in your pants, guys. Psst. Here comes your father. Nice try. I saw you looking. Mom says it's okay to look. Yeah, we're married, not buried! Look, I know you kids are excited about the food trucks that are stealing our business and bankrupting us. I'm excited. What's so great about getting food from a truck? There's no sitting area. There's no bathroom. There's long lines. Who eats like that? Animals eat like that. I don't know, Bob, I think it's nice. It's like camping. Except without all that awful nature. It's just a trend, Lin, and anyway, say good-bye to the trucks, kids. Because tomorrow we are taking back the street. And taking back the night! Respect for women! My body, my rules! (Western music plays, a hawk screeches) Okay, we're gonna block all the spots in front of the restaurant. You ready? Go! (Gasps) (groans) Go away! This street's haunted. Bobby, they're everywhere. We're outnumbered. I told you we should've had more children! (Grunting): I'm just gonna let you tire yourself out. Gene, stop. This was a terrible idea. Plan B, Dad! I'm slashing tires! No! Then they'll never leave. I'll poison the tires. It's the documentarian who hates Dad and puts wigs on cows. Werner Herzog? Oh, hello, Bob! I forgot you lived-slash-worked here. Well, I do. And you're blocking my restaurant with your ridiculous food truck. Ode to Soy? I'm soy excited that you like it. I don't. What are you doing here? Are you making another documentary? No. Filmmaking was just a hobbytunity for me. And now you own a food truck? How can you afford this? Hmm... I have my ways, Bob. One of those ways is that I have inheritance from my grandfather. You'll be able to read all about my food trucking journey in my blook. What's a "blook"? A blonde cook. Blooks have more fun. No. It's a blog I'm writing that I'm turning into a book. And then probably a bloovie. You-you can't take two words and make them into one stupider word, Randy. Well, Bob, now you're not invited to the blemiere. Aww. Well, good luck with your terrible vegan food. Oh, thanks, Bob. Good luck with your terrible life. Good luck with your stupid walk. I hate the way you walk. Oh, good luck with wearing that face all over the world. Good luck with your ble... your blemishy face. My what? B... B... B-wha? Good luck with your speech therapy. See, this is what I mean... idiots in trucks selling food to idiots on the sidewalk. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I want it! Oh, Genghis Flan! I think I saw pizza straws! Oooh, Ain't Muffin To it! Yay! Se Bob? Look around... food trucks are the future. No, they're a trend. Yes, the trend of the future. Well, maybe I'll just get my own food truck, Randy, and park it right out front here. You should! Maybe I will! You seriously should! It's a good idea! Then if it's a good idea, I'm going to do it! Well, I hope that you do, because it is a good idea! Well, do you seriously think it's a good idea?! Yes, I do! That's what I'm trying to tell you! Well, then, I will do it! All right, I'm glad you took my advice! Well, I'm not mad at you anymore! I'm not mad at you in the first place! 'Cause if you think it's a good idea, I should get a food truck! Bob, I'm just mirroring your energy! Fine. I'm... my point is I'm a cook. I could do it. Right? Okay. Yes. I think it's a good idea. Thank you. What happened there? (Phone rings) Bob's Burgers. Bob (on phone): Lin, I did it. Did what? Bob: Look out in the street. I'm fighting back. Linda: I'm looking. I'm not seeing anything. You're scaring me. Bob: Just pull the cord and come to the window. What? Nothing's there. Bob: Okay, switch to the cordless. It broke. Bob: Eh... Never mind. Just come outside. Gotta go. Bob: What do you mean, you have to go? You don't have to say "gotta go," I'm on the phone with you. Oh. Bob: I said come outside. What do you mean, "gotta go"? I'm nerv... You're making me nervous. Bob: Just come outside. Gotta go. (Ice-cream truck music plays) Ta-dah! Ahhh. What is it? I bought a food truck. I'm gonna show 'em, Lin! I'm gonna show 'em all! (Engine sputters and dies) Don't, don't breathe that. (coughs) I'm sure it's fine. Bobby, you bought a food truck? How can we afford this? We can't. Really. I had to dip into Gene's college fund. Nah, I probably won't be needing it. But what about all that stuff you said about not giving in to trends? We're selling out! Yeah! Gene, we're not selling out. We're gonna steal customers from our own restaurant. We'll never see it coming. This truck needs a makeover. Makeover, ooh! We're gonna turn this whore into a Pretty Woman! Big mistake! Big! I love that part. When she does that. She goes in the store. Bob, you're not gonna close the restaurant, are you? Now that you're a hotshot food truck guy? I'm not a food truck guy, Teddy. Besides, I can't afford to close the restaurant. I'm just stealing my customers back. I... You don't have to steal me back. I never buy anything off a truck except stereos and stamps. Love that stamp truck. Tina (on walkie-talkie): Bob's one to Bob's two. Tina, use our code names! Tina: Oh, sorry. Black Beauty to Music Man and The Godfather. What's your 20? Over. We're in the wheelbarrow with Back-hair and The Jackal. I better be the Jackal. Dad. Grow up. Okay, I got the flat-top all installed here. Couple things to know. I rigged it so the grease'll drain into this trap. You don't open it while you're driving, or you'll coat the road behind you. Cars'll be slipping and sliding all over the place. Slippity-slide! It's not a joke. It's very serious. Ah, it sounds funny. Oh, one more thing; This is important. What was it? Oh, yeah, you can't have the truck and the grill going at once. Okay. What'll happen? Could be fine, could be a giant fireball. Hey, does this turn the grill on? Yes, it does, Gene. Gene, no! So, you want me to just start over here, Bob? (Sighs) Yup. Same invoice? Why not? Who else doesn't want to go to college? Me! Me! Louise: It's weird to look at the restaurant now. I can't believe I used to work there. This must be how the astronauts felt the first time they saw the Earth from space. So small. So fragile. This isn't so bad, right? It's tight quarters, but it's kind of cozy. If by "cozy," you mean it reeks. Yeah, why do your armpits smell like feet? And his feet smell like chili! 'Cause I don't wash. But do you season? Get up, Gene. Hi, I'm Tina. May I take your order? Sure, Dina. I'll have a... No. My name is, uh... Dina. Okay. That's what I said. Tina's on break. Dina's filling in... and I'm her. Kids, hold down the fort. I gotta drop a potato in the crockpot. Got it. Back-hair's deucin', over. Copy that. Wait. Where's everybody going? Oh, Bob, you're adorably naive. Food trucks go wherever hungry people are! Like super heroes. Like super heroes! Well, where is that, exactly? I'll never tell! Okay, the flea market and then the baseball game. Look, just... just follow me on Chowster. Adieu, Robert, adieu! Chowster? It's a site where we can post where the truck's gonna be every day, so people can follow us. You're gonna move the truck around? Can it even drive? Yes! I think. Downhill. I thought we were just gonna park out in front and steal our own customers. If you drive around, you'll be stealing someone else's. Yeah, well, we're not making enough money stealing from ourselves. Great. While you're in the party truck, I'll hold down the fort. The boring old fort with no wheels. Looks like we're adding "whine" to the menu. The road will be the perfect place for Dina. She's restless. (Grunts) Oh. (grunts) What should we call ourselves? We need a handle online. The Cat Burger-lers. Hmm, we're not an improv group. Beef curtains. Gene. Mm. You said I could say that once a year. Yes, on your birthday. @BobsBurgersFoodTruck is just fine. Yeah, if this was three years ago. Oh, you were serious. Beef curtains!   Meet me on the road  Hauling quite a load  Taking lots of drugs, I don't know what  A pen in a jug  Gettin' rest stop tugs  Might've hit a man, but didn't stop.    Yo-ho! Guys! Guess who closed the restaurant and came on the road? We're gonna be like the Partridge family, but with food. You closed the restaurant? Lin, we need to have both going at the same time. Fine, then you go work there. I don't want to. Good! So make room for Mommy in the fun-bus! Dad, drive. Hey, hey! Bob: Lin, come on. Gene and Louise: Okay, go. I'm not in! Don't go! Gene: Yes! Go, go, go. Louise: Drive! Where you going? Hey, my foot! I told you this would be fun. Hey! Bob: All right. Everybody out. Bedtime. In the house? I hate the house. Now that we're not doing the restaurant, the house feels kind of pointless. What do you want to do, sleep in the truck? I'll go get the sleeping bags. Yeah! And my moisturizing gloves! And Tina's body pillow! He has a name! Sorry, Jeffrey. A new name calls for a new look. And a new voice. Tina talks like this. (Same voice): Dina talks like this. Nice-sized line, Bob. You're almost getting the hang of this. Yeah, you know, it's fun. Too bad we're not making any profit. Between the repairs, the gas... Hey, Dad... and that, we are still in the red. Oh, well, if you want to actually make money on this, you've got to get on the festival circuit. First one of the season is this weekend. Lolla-PA-foods-a? Isn't it funny how much more I know than you? No. I think it's embarrassing. Anyway... Everyone gets drunk and spends lots of money. And this year Tabitha Johansson is headlining the concert. Tabitha who? (Scoffs): The sexy pianist. She sings that song about oil spills, but you know she's talking about her v*g1n*. Gene. How do you know that? It's not subtle. It really isn't. Plus, the most popular truck gets a cash prize: A thousand bucks. Wow, that sounds great. We could really use a thousand bucks. The festival circuit. Maybe we'll never come home! Why would you? Yeah. We can get truck-schooled! And have truck prom. Hey, you'd be friends with everyone in school! You would. Oh, yeah. All right. Everyone's got their seat belt on. (Snores) Linda: Ooh... Ooh! This thing is big and intimidating. I don't know if I should drive it... Hey, Jennifer Slow-pez! Get the hell out of the road! My God, Lin. What? What's gotten into you? I don't know. This truck just makes me feel so powerful. I think I'm okay now. Hey, Driving Miss Crazy, pick a lane! Hurry up! Hurry up! Lin, are you okay? You seem a little on edge. I'm hopped up on bennies, Bob. Don't tell the kids. What? Where'd you get those? They hooked me up at the truck stop. See? These are non-drowsy antihistamines. Well, whatever they are, they're doing the trick. (Groans) It's gonna take forever to get inside. No, it won't. No one's using this right-hand lane, I'll tell you that. Uh, Lin, I think this is the sidewalk. (Horn blares, man gasps) Use the crosswalk, you maniac! You're gonna get yourself k*lled! Okay, you guys are my street team. We need to make some money, and it wouldn't hurt to win "most popular truck." Gene, Louise you're gonna pass out samples. I wouldn't mind passing out samples. Dina's ready to mingle. Fine by me! Let the new girl do it. Fine, just be aggressive. Dina only plays offense. Gene, Louise, you write our Chowster updates. Make us sound cool. Okay. Should I just write negative stuff about the other trucks so that people will come to ours? No, You should not do that. Okay, I definitely won't. Free samples. Bob's Burgers. Hey, cool glasses. Thanks. I need them to see. Ha! Is this organic? Sure. Is it grass-fed? Yes. Cruelty-free? Is it bison? That one is. Do these pair well with an IPA? It goes well with all letters. IPA, CSI, PTA, IRS, HMO, OMG. Where are you selling these? Uh, right over there. And that's how Dina plays the game. Man: Oh, yeah, totally. The definition of free-range, you know? Let's start with the dumpling stand. (Eating loudly) Okay, how was it? Mm, I wouldn't kick it out of bed for eating crackers. It tastes like they actually went to the dump to get this dumpling. That's not what I said. (munching) Woof! Someone put a leash on this quiche! (Munching) Let's not get this party tarted! (Chuckles, munching) These crepes gave me cramps! Hey, guys, what have you been doing? Lying on Chowster. You? Lying to hipsters. I'm lying to myself. I do not look good in shorts. (Crowd murmung) Wow, this is going great, huh, Lin? Drunk people like hamburgers. It's not science.  Oh, it's hot and wet and slick  And it's making everybody sick  (breathy):  Oil spill!  Oil spill  Oil spill.  Ugh, you were right. It's not subtle. See? Ooh, thank you, everyone. And now I'd like to welcome festival chairman Paul Blinkman to announce the food truck winner. Hello, everybody, it's Paul Blinkman. How we doing out there? What the hell, @BobsBurgersFoodTruck? "More like Boo-ritos"?! Trying to spread rumors, huh? You ruined my business today. "Samosas on a Stick will make your butt sick"? Wait. What? Wow, Dad, I didn't know you were such a mean girl. He's a nasty b1tch. Oh, Louise, you didn't. Okay, it's the moment you've all been waiting for. What an amazing competition this year, and we have a winner... it's a new truck... Bob's Burgers! (laughs) Hey, Bobby! Bob's Burgers! We won! Sorry, gotta go. Whoo! Boo! Boo! Boo! (Crowd booing) Come on. Don't boo. Look, I'm sorry my daughter wrote mean things about you and that we knocked off some of your mirrors. You're the one who knocked off my mirror? Boo! You're not even creative. You just make hamburgers. You're the worst! You're the worst! Oh, yeah? Well, guess what. We won! We schooled you! I liked his burgers. And they're grass-fed, cruelty-free soy-bison. Soy bison? No they're not. That's what Dina said. Uh... You lied to us! This is fraud! Freak! Liar! This is fraud! Dina, what have you done? Let's get him! My dad can take all of you, you weak hippies! Gene! Okay, maybe just the drunk guy who barfed on his baby. (laughs woozily) I'm gonna throw a falafel at him! There! Ooh, this crowd has energy! Uh-o. Bob, kids, get back in the truck. Tabitha:  Ener-g-gy!  I'm just going to, uh... go! Tabitha: Energ-g-gy! Oh! Oh, Dina, you are more trouble than you're worth. So long, Dina. Uh, everybody, stop. Let me... Wait! Stop! If you want to get to Bob, you're gonna have to go through me first. Let's get both of 'em! (Crowd clamoring) Here he is! Bob, Bob, let me in. What? You just turned against me, Randy. Please, Bob. I'm not strong. (Sighs) Fine. Whew, that was close, but we're safe now. There's nothing they can do to us in here. (Screaming) (banging) Is everybody okay? I'm okay. Kids? I can't feel my legs. (farts) Oh, never mind, it's just gas. Hey, Dad, the truck's upside down. I know, Tina. Okay. These foodies are showing some spine, and I like it! Again! Oh, God, we're gonna die! If I survive you, Bobby, I won't get remarried... for two years. I don't want to die a virgin. Me neither. Wait, that gives me an idea. No, no. I never should have given in to this stupid food truck fad. I miss the restaurant. Me, too. What is going on out there!? This was just supposed to be a food festival. Louise: Holy crap. Burn, you beautiful bench, burn! Burn, you beautiful bench, burn! It's nuts out there. I give 'em an hour till they're eating each other. I hope you're happy with yourselves. Look what your Chowster bullying did! Our bullying got us a thousand-dollar check! What about Tina's lies? It wasn't me, it was Dina. It's not a lie if you lie to vegetarians. You taught us that. I-I did teach you that. What about your road rage, Mom?! Yeah! What about it? It's not very good. Can we agree that Randy is blameless here? No. No. Whoa! Almost blameless? All of this started because of you! You got me on Chowster! You told me to come to this festival! All good advice! Look, if it'll make you feel better, I'll do something you tell me to do. Okay, punch yourself in the face, you idiot. I just was punched in the face... by your harsh words! Look, let's just lock the doors, hunker down and wait this out. Mm. Talk to me, Goose. What's going on out there? It's Lolla-PA-snooze-a-la out there. Okay, here's what we're gonna do. (People snoring) (quietly): Jump down, Randy. I'm scared. Oh, my God. I have weak ankles. Fine, stay up. (grunts) I thought you were gonna catch me. Catch you? Why would I catch you? Boys, stop fighting! Let's do the plan! (All grunting, truck creaking) Yeah! All right! No! No, no, no! No, no, no! (All screaming) Everyone, get in! Get in! Let's get 'em! (Grunting) (tires squeal) Gene, release the grease trap. Release the grease! (Gasping) Yes! See? I knew it was funny! We're doing it! We're losing 'em. Go, us. Ooh. Nice grill. May I? Randy, no! What? (Slo-mo yell): No...! Don't worry, everybody, only 15 miles to go. We almost had it all, didn't we? At least we didn't lose this check. I've got half of it right here! That's $500. That's not how it works, Gene. Yes, it is! You're not a bank. Oh, hey, Bob, I met a really interesting guy at the festival. He's got a holistic glassblowing studio. You want take the intro class with me? Oh, yeah, I do, Randy. Really? No. Hmm, so you lied. Yeah, Dad. Blow glass with Randy and some interesting guy. That sounds great. Okay, let's play the quiet game until we get back. Oh-ho-ho, you've done it now; I am great at the quiet game. Okay, so start now. Okay, I have started. And here we go. Well, you're already losing 'cause you just said something. I'm pretty sure I'm winning. Obviously. What are you talking about? The whole point of the quiet game is to stop talking. Let's start over. Round two. Okay, here we go. You just lost again. What are you talking about? Gene? So far, two nothing, me. You just lost. Louise, you want to say something? Ah... Did I win?! (Chuckles) No, you just lost. (Snoring) (bicycle bell rings) Bob?! Oh.  Oh, it's hot and wet and slick  And it's making everybody sick  Oil spill!  It's on the fish, it's on the crabs  Foul so close when you can grab  This oil spill  (breathy):  Oil spill... oil spill.  Oil spill... 
I'm a human spray bottle! Kids, just 'cause your father's not here, doesn't mean you can spit-shine the tables. Is Dad ever coming back? I don't know if it means anything, but when he kissed me good-bye this morning, he said "Goodbye Louise! I'll never ever see you again!" He's just at the dentist, Louise. Dr. Yap is dreamy. When he's looking at my molars, it's like he's looking right into my soul. Well I'm glad you like the dentist, Tina, but your father doesn't feel the same way. Getting him there is like pulling teeth. (laughs) Get it?! (anxious sigh) I don't like the OK of you. (feminine voice): "You can trust me, Bob." Yeah, but what about your friend? He looks really scary. (deep voice): I'm-a cut ya. (screams) Dr. Yap will be right with you. (high-pitched): Okay. Don't touch the instruments. They're sterile. So, it's okay, we're friends. No, it's not okay. You're not supposed to touch the instruments. I was being serious. Right, right, I'm sorry, yeah. Of course. Those aren't their voices. I know. (door bell jingles) Guess who's on new meds! Gayle! What a surprise! Look, kids, your Aunt Gayle is here. Oh, my God. You didn't even call. Who does that? Just you. And she brought a suitcase. This is the first stop on my Eat, Pray, Love trip around the world. All right! Aunt Gayle got her groove back... sexy. I'll only be here for a few days, on my way to lndonesia. Or maybe just home again and order lndonesian take-out. (grunts hungrily) All right, well, let me take your stuff upstairs. What's up with Linda lately? Wait, I brought gifts! I picked them out at a truck stop. For you Tina, a cassette tape. The original motion picture soundtrack to Milk. Cool. And for Louise... four-hour energy drink. I saved you the last 45 minutes. Thank you! And finally, for Gene, a jawbreaker. (gasps) I got candy! No fair! (laughs) I'll challenge you for it. What kind of challenge? Why don't you guys have a hug-of-war? Done! No, wait, wait! That's not fair! I love you! I love you! We can't use strength in this! Meh. Whoever makes the grossest drink gets the jawbreaker. Tina, you'll be the judge. Okay. Yeah.  Doo-wah, a little bit of butter, a little bit of dirt  Little bit of dirt, whoo  Hey. I need that! Stop it! Give it back! Bob's at the dentist today, so I gotta watch the kids and the restaurant. Well, why don't I take'em and go pick up Bob when he's ready? I've always wanted to drive a car. Oh, thank you! Ah, the new Gayle is happy and helpful... I love it. (gulping) (coughing) The use of dust from the floor was risky, but it paid off. I almost threw up. Louise wins. Yes! (grunts) Mmm! Hey, there, Bob. Ready to party? (muffled): Yeah. Ugh, what a day. What happened? I had a patient in here earlier and I accidentally stuck a needle through his cheek. Just... I hate Mondays. Oh... Uh, no, wait, wait, wait! Uh, wait, Dr. Yap, what is that? Oh, that? That's Greta. What'd you say, Greta? Huh? You ticklish? You're ticklish? You want me tickle you? You want me tickle you?! You have a really great relationship with your guitar. (playing funky guitar lick) Ah, no, wait, wait, wait. What's, uh... What's that? Oh, that's me at my $30,000 time share. I own it with six other families. Three times out of the year, I can go up there any time I want to. That sounds amaz... Wait, wait! What's that? That, my friend, is my latest graduation medallion... from The Persuasion Arts. It's the ancient art of picking up women. We follow The Prince of Persuasia's three-step program, and it works! The Prince of Persuasia? Mm-hmm. He's a prophet. And for three payments of $900, he can be your best friend. $900? That's right, Bob. Your negligent flossing habits are funding my one way ticket to Pound Town. Yeah. Well, I... Ow! I'll tell you all about it when you get back from Snooze City. Pound Town... I don't wanna see Pound Town.  Town of the pound...  Hello, Dr. Yap. Hi, Dr. Yap. Oh, hey, Dr. Yap. Funny running into you here. Hello, Belcher children and lady I don't know. I'm Bob's sister-in-law Gayle. Bob never mentioned he had a semi-attractive sister-in-law. Thank you. Bob never mentioned he had a dentist. (giggles) (chuckles) He's in Room One. Hey, baby. You look funny. Did you bring any honey for these biscuits? Oh! (Bob growls playfully) Oh, it's been a long time since my pillows got fluffed. You're stupid. Let's go home. For Christmas, I want to get Dr. Yap a subscription to Highlights. He loves that magazine. I'm gonna get him some laughing gas from my private tank. I'm gonna give him my business, from all this jawbreaking. Mm... (groans) Come on, baby, give me a smooch. Oh, we shouldn't... (both moaning) Your tongue feels so much different than my cat's. I guess we could go around the block one more time. (nervous laugh) Wait a second, ah... Whoo! (moans) Aah! Gayle! What are you doing here? I can't believe we did that, Bob. That was a huge mistake. We can't do it again. Although we both want to. What are you talking about? She's my sister, Bob! Linda can never know. Know what? You don't remember? We made love. What?! With our mouths. W-Wait a minute. We kissed? Yes, Bob. In the car. After you fondled my buttocks at the dentist's office. But Linda picked me up from the... Bob: Oh, God. Oh, my God. Oh, God... All these years, Bob, you could only keep those feelings bottled up for so long. Now... you're my boyfriend. Oh, God. Listen, Gayle, I was heavily drugged, okay? Tell no one. Wait, no, no. Gayle? Gayle?! Oh, no... What do I tell Linda? (whispers): Nothing. (screams) Louise: Mmm... (growls) Mm! Okay, new challenge! Whoever can listen to Teddy tell that story about his wel's the longest wins the jawbreaker. Okay, I'm game. Hi Teddy. What was that thing you were saying the other day, about your towels? Oh, about how I noticed my two towels were slightly different colors? Fascinating. Uh-huh. Right, and I was thinking, were they the same color when I bought them? Or have I washed one more than the other over the years? Great! That's it, huh? No, go on. There's more. What? Well, what do I do now? Do I wash the other one intensely to get it to match? Do I return them? Do I pretend I never noticed? Can I still use them as guest towels? When am I gonna have guests? I don't know. I don't know! What do I do? (groaning) You bought some at an estate sale once, didn't you? Oh, no, he didn't! Oh, did I tell you about that? No! You win! (laughs) I'll wait till Louise gets back. She loves my stories. Lin, we need to talk. Something happened earlier today. I know. You went to the dentist. I'm so proud of my little Bobby Baby Teeth. Linda, I kissed your sister. I was on drugs that the dentist gave me and I-I thought it was you, and now, your sister thinks we're going steady or something. That... is... wonderful! Y-You're not upset? (laughing): No, I'm not upset. Gayle is finally feeling happier and healthier, and you want to give her whatever she needs, Bobby. Whatever she needs?! What if, what if she wants to have s*x with me? Whatever she needs. s*x?! Gayle's always wanted whatever I had. I let her believe she was "dating" my high school boyfriend Carl for three years. Three years?! And after she dated Carl, she had the confidence to go after Vinny. I'totally lost. You're Carl. And, eventually, she'll find herself another Vinny. Now go get cleaned up for dinner. You have to look nice. (singsongy):  I know someone who likes you.  So, Gayle, are you seeing anyone right now? Funny you should ask. I actually just met someone. I feel like a teenager again. Except my breasts are more even now. Bob: Uh... It's like biting into a piece of forbidden fruit... unwashed fruit... so dirty... (grunts) This isn't happening. Gayle: I mustn't, I mustn't, but I mustn't not. (shouts) Linda, hallway, now. She had her toes on my crotch. I can't do this anymore, Lin. No, no, this is working. Now let's go have dessert. Who wants cookie dough ice cream?! Me! Yay! (deep voice): And me! Gayle:  One way or another  I'm gonna find ya, Bob, I'm gonna getcha, Bob  I'll getcha getcha getcha  One way or another  I'm gonna win ya  I'm gonna getcha getcha getcha getcha  One way or another, I'm gonna see ya  I'm gonna meetcha, Bob, I'll meetcha meetcha  One day, maybe next week, Bob  I'm gonna meetcha, I'm gonna meetcha, I'll meetcha...  No! (Peter Frampton voice):  Your tooth is a king now  It's got a crown on it...    (laughs) That's funny. So, you got any plans this weekend? Well, I have a family, so I don't really make plans. Yeah, I was gonna go up to my time share in the mountains; I invited my new hygienist. But she can't come. And she quit. You guys could go up if you want. You practically paid for half of it. Ah, no. No, thanks. Besides, my wife's sister is in town, so... Oh, you mean the amateur brunette mature that picked you up? (chuckles) I'd let that happen. Wait! Yes! You're Vinny! Let's go skiing! Allf us: You, Gayle, everyone! Boom. Yes, boom! What about kids? Can you handle some kids? Hell, yeah. It's biologically proven that children lead to s*xual intercourse and vice versa. (Frampton voice):  Children lead to intercourse.  Hm, I wouldn't phrase it like that. Really? You wouldn't? (Gene grunts happily) The jawbreaker may be going up the mountain with you, but it is coming down with me. What was that, Louise? I couldn't hear you with my jawbreaker in my ear. Get it out of there! Rubby-rub, ear, ear. Hey, enough! We're Dr. Yap's guests for the night, so behave, or else. Yeah, don't embarrass me. Let's just act like a normal family on vacation with their sexy dentist. Yeah... (laughing): Oop! Watch your face! (laughing) Look at that. It's working already. I told you. You make her feel good about herself and she's Dr. Yap's problem. Your work is done. So no more kissing my sister, you. (laughs) What? Huh? Hmm? Um, that's an expression for... peeing in the shower. I'm not gonna pee in the shower anymore. Why? Why doesn't he get to do that? Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Why can't I? And why bring it up now? It goes right down the drain. You know what? Let's all kiss our sister. (kids cheer) It seems like you and Dr. Yap are really hitting it off. You planned the perfect cover for us to have a romantic getaway. What? No. No cover. No. You pretend to flirt with Linda, I'll fake-flirt with Dr. Yap and then we can sneak off and hit the slopes... my slopes! Let there be light. Welcome to the Yap Trap! You caught me. I'll give you guys a grand tour. Linda, Bob, this is your room. Soundproof walls. (quietly): So don't hold back. I can yell anything I want; no one can hear me! Gene (muffled): I love my family! Gene. And here's the kids' room. Mirrors on the ceiling. Hey Dr. Yap, look up. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Okay, see you back in real life. Hi. That's funny. There's only one more bedroom but two people left. Me and Gayle. Yeah, Gayle, this room looks comfy. Why don't we just put your bags in here? No. I think I'd rather stay with you and Linda. Ho-ho, Lady Gayle. Don't you worry. We'll figure it out later. And last, but not least... "Jacooze." (chuckles) It doesn't get hot, but the bubbles still work. (quietly): We can make it hot. Hey, who's ready to go skiing? Let's get dressed. Yap, I thought you were hitting it off with Gayle. What happened? She's a fighter, Bob. I like it. And I have The Prince on my side. Hello there, my brothers. I almost didn't see you. I am... The Prince of Persuasia! There are three steps to persuading women. Step number one: Trap your princess. Physically corner her in a room and eventually, in your life. Step two: Insult your princess. Insult her face, her body, her brain, her car. The lower her self-esteem, the higher your chances, bro. It's been biologically proven. By me. Step three: Brag. Not lying, but close. Make up a story about how you single-handedly m*rder*d a wild animal. Your story is going to release a hormone, deep inside her body, called lnsatia. It makes women ovulate. For s*x. (quietly): Interesting. Woop. Oops. Oops. Oops. Whoops. Well, Gene and Louise don't want to ski, but you guys, you want to take a lesson? We don't need a lesson. Are you serious? You both know how to ski? Tina and I came up here for the Tom Selleck charity event... Ski for Babies. For every jump he went off, they were gonna give $100 to a baby. Yeah, but he was a no-show. All these people standing around with cameras. And babies. All right, fine. I'll skip the lesson and figure it out as I go. Whoo-hoo! Lin! Grab my hand! Whah-ha! Take me with you! Sorry! Missed ya! Aah! Oh, God. Step one: Trap him. Oh, Bob. This is our chance. (groaning): Oh, Gayle. No. We can't. Not here. It's too visible. We should do it in the forest. Right. Or the parking lot. Great. Step two: Insult your princess. Your face is fat. No, it's not. It's perfect. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What's that?  La, la, la!  Livin' it up!  Okay, we each shovel snow into our pants. First person to give up, get hypothermia, or die, loses. Okay. (both grunting) I'm fine. I love it. Yeah, I don't feel anything. This is great. Ahh... This feels incredible! (screaming) Here you go. Thank you very much. (groans) All right, I'll leave you two love birds alone. See you at the bottom! Yeah, last time I was out in the wilderness, I had to snap a wolf's neck while holding an orphan. Bob! Wait for me! One time, in P.E., I beat a dog at basketball. Playing hard to get, I see. Playing hard to get, I see. Here we go! (James Bond-like espionage theme playing) I love your ski suit, Dr. Yap. What size are you? I'm a men's petite six. Ooh, big boy. You wanna swap later? Swapsies! Last one down's a chimichanga! Hey, Bob! Let's look for a secluded part of the woods, so we can be alone. No, thanks. I'm good. Uh! Aah! Perfect. I'll just follow your lnsatia trail. (inhales deeply) (sultry exhale) (inhales deeply) Ah! Ah! (muffled): I'm okay. Okay. Who can build a better snowman? Ho-oh! Are you kidding me? I practically majored in snowman building. Nuh-uh-uh. Up there... Ooh... Bob! I'm gonna catch you! Gayle! This isn't funny! I'm out of control! Me, too! Mine's name is Greglisa, the androgynous snowman! He/She's from Thailand. Mine is a self-portrait of me in the future, when I own a falcon who holds my jawbreaker for me. (Bob and Louise scream) (Gene screams) No! (laughing) I win! Hey, where's the jawbreaker? Ow! Ow! What the hell? Oh, my God. I broke my tooth. Gayle: Finally, Bob. We're alone. Gayle, wait, I hurt myself. I'm not wearing anything under my snowsuit. Oh, my God! Except for my long underwear. And my socks. And my other socks. And a maxi pad. Ow! Gayle! This is serious. I need Dr. Yap. We don't need him anymore, Bob. Bob: Ow! Hi, Bob. Dr. Yap! Thank God you're here. This one's here. But this one's down here. Gayle! Bobby! Linda. Good. This has gone too far. And I broke my tooth. Tell everybody what's going on here. These two were fooling around, Linda. Oh, Linda, I am so sorry you had to witness our foreplay. I can't believe this! You're a hurtful slut, Bob! I can't take this anymore, Lin. You need to tell Gayle what's going on. Enough's enough. Ow! My tooth! Stop! Lin, please, drop the act! I'm in serious pain here! Good! It looks to me like you're in need of some serious dental work. And a smack! Ow! I don't have any Novocain with me, Bob, so... (Bob mumbles) Unfortunately for you... (mumbles) ... you'll be experiencing some pain. (mumbling): Uh-uh. A little pain might do him some good. Bring him back to his senses. No! I need drugs! Let's tie his tooth to the front door and then order a pizza and tell the guy to let himself in. That's stupid. Let's tie it to a deer, and then tell the deer he's late for a meeting! (mumbled): Gene. We're two princes, Bob. And we're going after the same princess. (whispers): But only one of us has pliers. (kisses) Why'd you kiss me? Stop it! No! Noooo! Yes! I have Dad's tooth! Who am I? Who am I? (deep voice): I'm Dad! Ow! My tooth hurts! Ow! I want it! Challenge me for it. Whoever drinks the most Jacuzzi water wins! Sold. Yeah! Dr. Yap, earlier today, I fell for you. But after watching you torture my father, I think we should just be friends. With dental benefits. Okay. Hey, now that Bob's out of the picture, maybe you and I could hop in the "Jacooze" for a nice cold dip, hmm? Eh, let me know when Bob wakes up. But... I-I did all three steps! (woeful sigh) Nobody likes me! Aw, people like you. (high-pitched squeals, sobs) Shh, shh. Little baby. Little baby. You don't worry about Gayle, okay? You're a good guy. A real catch. No! No! Ow... What happened? You! Linda wasn't enough, huh? So you had to have Gayle, too? Well, maybe if you dropped the whole persuasion thing, Gayle might actually pay attention to you. Well, Linda pays attention to me. In fact, she said she wanted to get in my snow suit. Didn't you, Linda? What? I did? You did?! Wait a minute! You're in love with Dr. Yap?! Hmm... Yes! I am in love with Dr. Yap. You are? Wait, what is going on here? Well, that's too bad, because I'm in love with him. I knew it from the moment we met that this short, weird, musky dentist was the man of my dreams. Makes sense. He's mine! No, he's mine! (both women grunting) Who wants me more? Don't be gentle. No! Come on, Dr. Yap. Let's go. See? It all worked out. It all worked out?! You slapped me. I lost a tooth. When I saw her on top of my Bobby, kissing him and touching him... oh, I went mental. Well, I'll never kiss your sister again. Next challenge! First person to catch a squirrel wins! I'm the Squirrel Whisperer. But you put me up to this. Yeah, well, I didn't appreciate seeing it with my own eyes. But hey, at least we got to go skiing, right? That was fun. Right? Gene: Got one! No fair! It's dead! It's not dead. It's sleeping. Gene wins the tooth. Come on! Yeah! Let's get out of here, squirrel. The Prince: Dress like her dad. It release a hormone called moan-a-tonin. When you get into an elevator with a woman, press a higher number than her, and then make a big deal about it. Push her in a lake. Be one of the tallest guys in the bar, and brag about how long your butt-crack is. Sing a song that you supposedly heard on the radio, and make fun of her for not knowing it. Use the word "idiot." Never make her pancakes. Force her to make you pancakes, in the middle of the night.
Dad, don't forget monkey brains. Yeah, and we need more unicorn testicles. That's where dreams are born. All right, we'll get those, then head back to the restaurant. I just need fresh kale for the burger of the day... "If Looks Could Kale." Ha! Hey, Reggie, I didn't know you guys shopped here for your restaurants. What happened, Pepe? And why is your face painted like a cat? I lost my restaurant. We're trying to cheer him up. I'm a kitty. I'm a kitty. You didn't read the review? Three weeks after the Moody Foody's hatchet job, Pepe's taco joint is a yoga studio. A hot yoga studio. I bet, when it heats up, it smells like taco meat. Like my underwear. The Moody Foody's on a rampage. He nitpicks every little thing, Bob. He said my bread was stale. Well, it is pretty stale, Reggie. That's 'cause I buy day-old bread! Okay. Okay. I've been mapping the Moody Foody's patterns for months. He follows a precise ethnic sequence in restaurants: Asian, European, Latin, American. Like Larry King with his wives. Man, you guys are obsessed with this critic. You should be, too! According to my calculations, you're next. Um... okay, that's fine. For all you know, he's already reviewed you. He's a master of disguise. Yeah, when he reviewed my place, he was dressed like a construction worker. For me, he was an E.R. doctor. Before every meal, he wipes his hands with a blue handkerchief. Blue. Watch for that, Bob... blue. (whimpers) Here you go... $30. What? No, I didn't ask for these. Nobody asks. You describe it, you buy it. Oh, look. He even got the hanky. Tina: Can you draw me on a horse with a zombie riding behind me? No. Draw a picture of my dad's mustache really giving it to a caterpillar. No, don't do that. Do it! Do it! Do it! Hold on to these sketches, Bob. They could save your restaurant. Uh, Tran, my restaurant will be fine. After all, Reggie's bread is stale. And, Pepe, your carne asada isn't even beef. Carne asada is beef? And Tran's noodles are... So what? I reuse my noodles. If people don't eat them all, I'm supposed to just waste them? It's just, no offense, fellas, but I use fresh ingredients, so, you know, I should be all right if this critic comes. Offense taken. Here's you on a horse with a zombie. 50 dollars. Dad, pay the man. No, $50... for that? $50... it's a little girl, a horse and a zombie. Dad, that's so cheap for what you're getting. Look, if the critic comes, it's just another customer, you know? I know. Just a customer who can shut us down with one bad review... that's all. I know he can destroy us, Lin. I don't need a pep talk. And if I did, this would be a horrible pep talk. It's him, Dad. It's the Moody Foody. Bob: Gene, that's Mike the Mailman. You've seen him every day for the past five years. It's the long con. It's him. Tina, that's Gene. Long con. Thanks, Mike. Yeah, thanks, "Mike." I cannot hear you. That's got to be the food critic. A Civil War reenactor? Ah, can't stand all that drab gray. No wonder they lost. All right, keep an eye out for the blue handkerchief. ("Dixie" ringtone plays) Hello? You're really sorry? Okay, I'll... I'll come do the battle. For the record, the buttons are authentic. All right, everyone, back to work. We're not going to stand around and wait for a food critic who may or may not ever show up. Dad, Dad, another Civil War reenactor is here. He must be fighting for the North. Bob: It's a Hasidic Jew, Gene. You know that. Blue hanky! Blue hanky! Blue hanky? Blue hanky? Yes, blue hanky! That's the Moody Foody! (gasps) Blue hanky! Blue hanky! Right there... blue hanky! Aah! Hanky panky! Blue hanky right there! Blue hanky! Gene: Hanky panky! Quick, circumcise Gene. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Circumcise me! Circumcise me! Quick, quick! Okay, the Moody Foody is here in our restaurant. This is happening now. Do you need a diversion? I'll scream. Cockroach! Gene. Let's bribe him. Dad, take out the lettuce and replace it with this $20 bill. That I took out of your wallet. Oh, or tape it to his back. That's not how a bribe works, Tina. (muffled): Yes, it is! Now, everybody calm down, all right? We just do what we do... we give him a delicious meal, we get a positive review, and that's that. Yeah, 'cause if we don't, it's curtains. We're done. Lin, stop pep-talking! Wha...? Let's just take a deep breath... (sighs heavily) Not like that. (muffled sigh) (exhales) Where'd Tina go? She's out taking the critic's order. No, no, no. Time for the charm b*mb to explode. Hi there, customer. Is someone hungry? That's why I'm here. Are you ready to order? Uh, yeah. I just need another second. Are you just going to stand there and stare at me? Uh-huh. Oh, God. (Linda sighing) Louise, go get Tina. Shift's over, sweetheart. Let's talk Palestine. Or my order, we could talk about. Oh, God, Lin, go get Louise. All right, all right, all right. (gulping) Shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo. How we... (belches) ... doing today? The food here is so delicious. I'm a customer. Try the pad Thai. Mmm. Okay, everyone, great job. Back in the kitchen. Sorry about all that. Um, I'd like to recommend the burger of the day... the "If Looks Could Kale" burger. (chuckling) Uh, you get it? Mm-hmm. Uh, well, you're not laughing. I don't think you got it. "If Looks Could Kale." Yeah, I-I got it. (sighs) I'll have a cheeseburger. Coming right up. (whispering): That guy's creeping me out. Okay, it got a little rocky out there, but we righted the ship. I set it up, you knock it down. Right, Dad? Yeah... right. Thanks, Tina. Smooth sailing. Just like every day. So, well, what kind of burger did he order? Crap. So, I know we discussed having the burger of the day, but I want to say you didn't want that. Where did we land, uh, in the end? You seriously don't remember? No, I do. Um... cheeseburger. Just remembered. I just remembered on my own. Cheeseburger! Gene: Got it. Gene: Uh-oh! Oh, God. Gene: Aah! That's just the 3:00 fire. Your burger may take an extra minute. In the meantime, enjoy the show. Gene! Oof. (groaning sigh) Ugh. (groans) "Overdone and dry." It's like, uh, "above and beyond," right? (groans) It's not bad. What about "insufferable"? What's that? Maybe that just means he didn't suffer. That's good news. I've seen some murders in my line of work, but what a hit job. Wait, here's something good. "The best part of the meal was..." "Continued on page 45." "... was the napkin I spat my food into. Thank you, little napkin." Oh. This is my fault. I screwed up the burger. It's my fault. So it's settled. Wait a minute. You screwed up. And you and you. All right, stop the finger-pointing. (sighs) I'm sorry. I... sometimes I forget how horrible you all are at your jobs. You're all horrible! Sorry. I mean, you are horrible, but I shouldn't have said it so loud. All right, okay. That's enough of the papers. But you are! Okay, okay, enough. Stop... How bad could everybody be?! Stop the yelling. Who cares about one bad review? Don't be such a baby. Come, come, come. This is one of my vacant spaces. It used to be a burger restaurant. Hi, Bob. Hey, Mr. Fish. How are you? Hi, Mrs. Burger. Good. Uh, Mr. Fischoeder, this is still a burger restaurant. Yeah, let us die slowly in peace, you vulture. Right you are. One bad review won't sink the SS Bob, will it? You're like a benign tumor. With a little bit of hair and teeth. I'm like a tumor with teeth? Sounds cute. Yes, little man. It's a compliment. Let's come back in a week. It should be empty by then. Don't worry, Bobby. People can make up their own minds. You'd be surprised. They don't need some critic. As long as we get Michelin-recommended, we'll be fine. Order up. (groaning) What? What? Something wrong with the burger? No, uh, it's fine. It's just... maybe you missed the mark with this one, is all, you know? What? What do you mean, Teddy? I don't know, Bobby. Just tastes a little... overdone and dry or something. Overdone and dry, Teddy? You're just quoting the review. No, I know. It's just, now I have words to put to my tastes. Will you get a mind of your own, Teddy? I mean, seriously... with your dead eyes! What? My eyes aren't dead. He's not dead. No, I'm fine. And you, Mort. What did I... what did I do? Whatever! (sighs) Lin, this review is going to be the end of us. People think we're terrible now. Not terrible. We're not terrible. Bobby, you know that. Look at me. I know that, but it doesn't matter. We have one crappy day, and then everybody reads about it, and now that's what they think... forever. Man: Hey, how about this place? Oh, yeah? Well, your haircut's overdone and dry! And you, your pants are overdone and dry! Look at your dumb face! It's overdone and dry! Get back here, people! Where are you going? I want to review you Yeah! I'm going to review everyone! You're getting it! Overdone and dry! Overdone and dry! Overdone and dry! Overdone and dry! Overdone and dry! Overdone and dry! "Two thumbs down... my throat." (chuckles) That's just rude. Put it down, Bobby. Just stop. Enough. Attaboy. Good day, sir. Good day, Louise. Actually, you've had better days. That's why we're here. We're the PR firm of Cooper, Molyneux and Juarez. Wait. What happened to Belcher? Recent events have left the name, Belcher, badly tarnished. Tina? Here's Dad's image before the review. Here's Dad's image after the review. Rock bottom. Aw. They made a poster, Bobby. Uh, you guys were there, too... remember?... destroying our business. Hey, hey, hey. Um, I'm pretty sure I was in Sausalito that day. I'm pretty sure you weren't, Gene! All right, all right, let's stop blaming and start gaming. Our firm specializes in image rehabilitation. This is our Basic lmage Cleaner Package. Lunch is included. Gene: Our Bad Boy Robot Package comes with a boob job. Lunch not included. Your father doesn't need his image cleaned. He's not a celebrity. Dad's a local celebrity. Like Eyebrow Man. Remember before his eyebrows grew out and he was just Parrot Man? I hate that parrot. Hi, parrot. (squawks) Nerd alert! What? No one knows about peoples' bad days in other professions. None of these jobs get reviewed by critics. I.T. support? That doesn't get reviewed. Sales analyst, not reviewed. Stop torturing yourself. You know what, take off your cranky pants and go take a nap, all right? Accounts receivable specialist. What's that? Sounds great. I bet that job never gets reviewed.  Bup-bup-bup-bow, bup-bup-bow  Bup-bup-bup-bow-bup-bup-bow!    (laughs) I love this song. Sam my man from Uzbekistan! You got the Bob in the house! A lot of e-mails. Mostly spam. What is that, ramen? Tea. Oh. I thought it was ramen. No. Tea. Hey, what are we talking about? I thought Kathy was making ramen. For some reason, I saw noodles. Nope, just tea. Huh. (groaning) (air hissing) (hushed): Hey, it's Jason's birthday. Did you sign the card? (whispers): Not yet. Oh, here. To the J-man. (groans) It's good cake. My wife made it. (a la Borat): My wife! (all laugh) Borat! Hey, do it again! Jeff, get in here! You gotta hear this! My wife! Yes! No! ... 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 35... Linda, kids, napkin holder, ice cream machine! Oh, come here! Dirty spot on the counter that I can never get out! Get over here! I love you. What the hell is wrong with you? I had a nightmare, Lin. I worked in an office. I had to sign a birthday card. Don't touch me. You're all sweaty. I hate signing birthday cards. You sign ours. Actually, your mother does it for me. Oh. Sorry. Like we read those things. Where's the money? (chuckles) You know, I realized I'm not a cubicle guy. I can't do it. I can't do anything other than this. Yeah, look at you. If this restaurant fails, I'm gonna k*ll myself. There he is, that's the spirit. Yup. You should ask for a redo. A what? A redo. One time, to get out of a Spanish test, Kelly Mathis forced herself to throw up. I mean, vomite. Hmm. Then another time, to get out of a math test, she forced herself to get her period. That's how she got a redo. A redo! That's genius! We'll get our period! No, a redo. No, period! I'm gonna walk over to the Moody Foody's house and cook him dinner! Wine him, dine him, 59 him, Dad! That's right, Gene! (growls) Thank you, Tina. This time I'm gonna make the Moody Foody a great burger. All right! If you think that's the right move, I trust ya... kinda. Chant me out! Kids: Redo! Redo! Redo! Redo! Let's go watch this train wreck. All: Stalking Dad quietly! Stalking Dad quietly! Oh, well, well, well, the guy who couldn't remember my order finds my address? How'd you manage that? Well, let's just say some of my fellow disgruntled restauranteurs have been dumpsacking your house. Oh, yes, the flaming bags of poop. But I'm not here to do that, all right? I-I came here to cook you another burger. Oh, well that's so ni... I'd rather be dumpsacked. Listen, I know your Bob's Burgers experience was subpar. I just want a redo. Of course you do. Great! Let's get started then. Where's the kitchen? Ah! What is that?! It's a Taser! Ow! That stings! What is that supposed to do? It's supposed to incapacitate you. I'm gonna send in a bad review. I am... not shocked. Hey! Oh, oh, I'm calling the police! Don't, don't. Wait! I just want to cook you dinner! I just want you to try my burger, okay? Get off me! Just let me cook you a burger! Ow! Ah! You're biting me! Ah! Get... Ow! Stop! Dad, we felt we should be here as your PR fir... Oh, yes! This doesn't look like a redo. Tickle fight! Hyah! Listen, kids, taping people to chairs is bad, okay? Never do this. We're just helping him calm down so that he can enjoy this burger. Bye-bye, frown! Now it's a smile! There. Comfy? (angry grunting) Good. This is an old classic of mine. It's called the "Girls Just Wanna Have Fennel" burger, huh? God. Was that a nose laugh, huh? Ow! No! Oh. I laughed, Dad. Thanks, Tina. Yeah, me, too! Don't tie us up! Okay, big boy bite. No, nuh-uh, no. Not happening. Uh-huh, uh-huh. Mm-mm. All aboard the burger train! No, I'm not getting on the... Open up the tunnel. Choo-ch-ch-ch... Mm-mm, mm-mm. (doorbell rings) Are you expecting someone? Oh, that must be my next kidnapper. Linda: Bobby, you in there? Lin? What are you all doing here? Linda told us about the redo. We brought food from our restaurants. I brought no food because that man, he ruined my restaurant. So... how's it going? Uh, not great. He won't eat my burger. What? Well that's just rude. Linda, wait, don't... Bobby... (gasps) you've taken him hostage? (chuckles) No, no. He's in his own home. "Hostage" is a little much. It's not that. No, no, "hostage" sounds about right. Shut up! This is dark, Bob. Real dark. I'll go get the jumper cables out of my car. No, no, no, no, no. This should catch any blood or bodily fluids. No blood, no jumper cables. Yes, jumper cables! The man Tased you, Dad! I just want him to eat my burger. (gasps) You Tased my Bobby and you won't eat his burger? Well, we'll just see about that, won't we? Now all aboard the burger train! Open up the tunnel, li'l baby! I tried that already. Didn't work. Oh. We can make him eat. Oh, goody. Are those the exact noodles I didn't finish three months ago? No, they are the noodles somebody didn't finish yesterday. So, there! Oh, yeah? Well eat this! Mm-mm! Mm-mm! Hey, come on! Come on! Well, if you won't eat our food, then choke on your reviews, huh?! Does this taste like enchilad-ass? All: Eat it! Eat it! Eat it! Eat your words, all of 'em! All right! So, Moody, eat the foody. Guys, stop! Shove it in there, you get it in! Guys! This is crazy. He's not worth it. You're right, no one will miss him. No, Pepe! That's not what I meant. (doorbell rings) What now?! He tripped the silent alarm. Delivery. I need someone to sign. Help! He's seen too much! No, no, no, no, no, no! All right, this redo is officially out of control. Just now? That's when it's out of control? Uh, breaking and entering, kidnapping. Oh, and now opening other people's mail! It's not what I envisioned. What the hell is this? You bought Tin Cup? That's a terrible movie. You mean "classic"? I like Tin Cup. But it's a bad movie, right? You ever see it? No, I didn't see it. Then how do you know it's bad? I don't know. It's just bad, right? People think it's bad. I think I read a review of it or something. See? You didn't bother to see the Tin Cups because some critic gave it a bad review! Hypocrite! Who knows? Maybe you would have loved Tin Cups. Tin Cup. Tin Cup. Tin Cups. No, it's Tin Cup. Tin Cup. Tin Cup. Yes. Tin Cup. Tin Cup. This is k*ll*ing me! Good, 'cause it's all your fault! You're right. You know, you may have taped down my arms, but you have opened my eyes! I'll never give a bad review again! Yay! In fact, I'm gonna go back and change all my bad reviews to glowing ones... and add smiley faces. I think he might be joking! Reggie, he is. Enough talk! Do what you're gonna do to these guys! Nobody's doing anything. He did his job. And you know what? I'm gonna go do mine. Come on. Let's go back to our restaurants and cook. Those of you that still have restaurants. Oh, that's messed up. He's talking about me! (yells) Bob's got a point. What are we even doing here? I should be back at my restaurant smell-checking the meats. From now on, I will only dumpsack him when I'm in the neighborhood. But you took the fun out of it. Sorry you got mixed up in this. So, uh, what's it gonna take for you to forget about today? (gasps) $350. $350?! Yeah. Um, all right, fellas, cough it up. Ah! I don't have a... I forgot, um... Seriously? You're not talking about me. I, uh, have, um... $48 here. Give me the DVD. You want Tin Cup? Does it have any special features? Yeah, It's got outtakes. But they call them "Mulligans." Oh, come on! Before we cut this guy loose, I just want one slap, okay? In the back of the head. You should give him a purple nurple. No, wet willy! What is a wet willy? A Guillermo mojado. Ah. You do it. I have no spit. Willy! Willy! Willy! Willy! Willy! Willy! Willy! Guillermo. Guillermo. Okay, one wet willy. ("Stuck in the Middle with You" begins) (gasps) (gasps) (screams) (crow squawks) Kevin Costner (on TV): That's how you make a birdie! Rene Russo: You're in the rough, McAvoy. That's okay. I like it rough. Is she still talking about golf? One of the top five Don Johnson movies, Tin Cup. Are you still doing the half-off-your-meal... meal-when-you-bring-in- a-bad-review promotion? Yes, the promotion brought to you by PR giant, Cooper... Great. Nice to have business back on track. Yeah, but Bobby, I'm still so nervous the cops are gonna show up. Yeah. I wonder if he called the cops. (distant phone ringing) Hmm. 911. What's your emergency? 911. What's your emergency. Sir? Hmm. Mmm. Hello? Mmm! Sir? Oh...! Great. Another one of these calls. Get a girlfriend! Well, if the cops come, we need a plan. We can put Dad in a dress and tell them he's our aunt. Yeah, we'll call him "Aunty Man Hands." She came into town for Dad's funeral. Oh, plot twist. I'm not gonna wear a dress. Pantsuit? Okay, fine. I'll go get some pantsuits! Fashion show!
(dog barks) (tires screech) Okay, everyone, I hope you've all chosen your lab partners wisely. I have. You'll notice a mixture in front of you on the Bunsen burner. Buns... sen. This mixture is the most powerful love potion known to man. Whatever you do, don't drink it. Jimmy Junior, no! It will make you want to touch each other's butts! Too late. I don't need a love potion to want to do that stuff... with you. (glass shatters) Miss Jacobson: Chad doesn't have a partner. Maybe he can join you. (moans) The more the merrier. (moans) Linda: Kids...! Linda: Time for breakfast! Damn. What kind of a maniac wakes up an hour early to write erotic fan fiction? Me. Louise: Are there any shows or movies left in the world that you haven't perved up? No. That's why I've started writing erotic friend fiction. Using people at school and zombies. Oh! Do the janitor and the vice principal. I think they'd have beautiful children. I did and they don't. Good morning, my little late bird. What's with the vest? It's my Welcome Wagon vest. I'm showing a new girl around school today. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, Bob, this is what we're seeing tonight! Ugh. Commercial Announcer: Experience patty cake like never before. Cake. The New York Times says, "Cake makes everything we've been doing with our hands obsolete." This week at the Wharf Arts Center. War Farts! Wow. What a must-miss. No kidding. Stop it. We're going. (chanting): Let's get to Cake as fast as we can! Ah! Bob: Ugh. This is the cafeteria, And that's our American flag... Tina, no offense, but this tour is giving me a snore-gasm. Show me something good. Well, there's a typo on the lunch menu. It says "browie." Seriously, what do you do for fun around here? I think there's more on the Tina tour than you're showing me. Okay. There is one place I like to go. Tammy: What is this? Tina: The boys' locker room. You can only see up to their ankles. So, you just go around looking through random holes? Yes, but not anymore. Now I just look through this one. Those are Jimmy Junior's feet. I can tell by the way he walks. So confident, but still figuring things out. Zeke: Ha! (chuckles) Jimmy Jr.: No, Zeke! Skid marks. (chuckles) That's not funny. They're stripes. Smelly stripes. (chuckles) Zeke: Phew, you stink! Tammy: Okay, and who is that? Zeke. He's got some hyper in his diaper. I'd like to see what that shin bone's connected to. Tammy, don't. Someone might see us. Man: Hey, what's going on in there? Hi, Coach Blevins. (Tina groans) I can't believe I got detention. It's no big deal, Tina. Don't have a crap attack. Sucks they give you detention for wrestling in the library. What is this, Nicaragua? Yeah, this school's lame, right, Zeke? (Zeke scoffs) That's Jimmy Junior and Zeke. The feet from the locker room. Mm, manimal. Introduce me, okay? (smacks lips) Here. Oh. Mmuh, mm... Hey Jimmy Junior! Zeke. This is Tammy. She's new at school. Hey, (giggles) What's... Hi, what's up? My loog. (hacks, then spits) (grunts) You like that, baby? No. Nice loogie, Zeke. Hey, Jimmy Junior, look at this. (hacking, chokes, coughing) I'm okay. Tina! Where the hell have you been? Did you fall in something shiny on your lips? Mm. (smacks lips) Strawberry. I got detention. Others: Detention?! Really? I can't believe this! Detention is no big deal, Mom. Don't have a crap attack. What did you just say? A crap attack. Don't have one. (gasps) Don't you tell me not to have a crap attack! I'll have a crap attack any time I want! Now, go to your room! This is such a snore-gasm. (exhales) What the hell was that about? What is it? Yeah. A crap attack? I don't know. Do you? Don't look at me. Well, you're the one that wanted to have one. You're the one that sent her to her room for saying it. I don't know what these kids are saying. Don't have a crap attack. (laughing and screaming) Nice, Bob. Nice. (giggles) I can't believe Tina got detention. She's changing, Bobby. Tina's turning into a teen. You've lost her, Mom. Time to focus on your good daughter. Gene. I'm pretty. You know, maybe you're overreacting, Lin. I mean, you did have a crap attack. Ha...! She's supposed to baby-sit tonight while we're at Cake. Can we even trust her now? That's a good point. Maybe we should stay home. What? Please? We're not skipping Cake. Okay, fine. But I'm gonna complain the whole time. Yeah! You're the baddest girl in detention, Tina. Tell me about it, stud. (giggles) I'm a stud. I'm an idiot. I know, Zeke. Don't talk anymore Tammy, spill that. Jimmy Junior, mop that up with your pants. Okay. Linda: Tina! We're waiting for you! (big sigh) We need to go over some ground rules for tonight, Miss Mouthy. No boys, no parties, no summoning spirits or switching bodies, and no filling the house with soap bubbles. You hear me, Tina? Yes. I wear glasses, not hearing aids, Mom. Ho! Well, I don't wear a hearing aid either, so I didn't hear that. Haw! Well, good night. What are you doing with the emergency cell phone? Texting my friend Tammy. That'll cost a fortune! We have a terrible data plan! Tammy wants to come over. I texted back a smiley face. She texted back some letters I don't understand. I think she's coming over. Oh, my God, is she or isn't she? I can't wait to ha... (snores) Louise, wake up, Louise! (screaming) Ugh. Huh? Cute room. I used to have one of these. I cut its mane off. I bet that looked cool. I'm totally going to do that. (whispers): No, I won't. This is like watching two monkeys at the puberty zoo. What's wrong with her face? Looks like she needs a flu sh*t in her eyes. What's this? It's my erotic friend fiction. "Tina reached towards Jimmy Junior's butt: "'Your lips say no but your butt says yes.'" This is hilarious! It's not meant to be hilarious. It's supposed to be erotic. Maybe you don't understand it. Oh, I understand. And I'm into it. But never let Jimmy Junior see this. He'd be weirded out and he'd never talk to you again. Really? Oh, my God, there's a little drawing here of Jimmy Junior's butt. (laughs) (farts) Wha...? What just happened? I think Tammy laugh-farted. That really smells, Tammy. What? I didn't fart, you did! Oh. Okay. Come on, if you're gonna be loud, you gotta be proud! Anyway, since you're such a good writer, how about texting Zeke and Jimmy Junior and inviting them over? I need a Zeke peek. I'm not allowed to have boys over. (groans) Come on, Tina. Bring your friend fiction to life. Uh... Come on, do it, do it. Do it, Do it. Good. Okay, okay. I'll tell them to get their butts over here. Yeah. How do you do an emoticon for butt? Three. Three... three... Oh, I hope you got a jar to pee in, Gene. We're gonna be in here a long time. I've got Tina's rain boot. Okay. I'll take the other one. (rhythmic clapping) Isn't her hair cute? I did it. Do I look just like Tammy? This is Tina talking, not Tammy. Uh, I know who you are. Oh, 'cause I look like Tammy. No, not really. When I'm 14, I'm gonna shave my head bald. You guys want to play truth or dare? Great, good. I dare us all to drink this! Margarita Mix! The heavy stuff! Cool. That's my mom's! I know, I took a little booze cruise through your living room. Does margarita mix have alcohol in it? No. Mom uses it to fill the humming bird feeder. (gulps) Oh, my God, I totally feel it. Whoo! Come on now, let's kick on some tunes! I want to hear some FM, baby. (grunting) You're disgusting. Whoo! Whoo-hoo! Oh, my God. I can't stop. Come on, girl! Come on! I can't stop! I can't stop! I'm dancing! I'm dancing, baby! (gasps) My porcelain horse, Horselain! Leg's broke. We gotta sh**t it. Sorry, Horselain. Let's shift into after-party mode. (turns off radio) Okay, after party is over. Time to go home. Come on, Tina. We were just starting to have fun. I got to go anyway. My dad's girlfriend just had a baby and she's nursin'. I want to go check that stuff out. I'd check that out with you, Zeke. Tina: I'll walk you out. Come on, Tammy! (sighs) So lame. Later, square bear. Bye. (sighs) Louise: Tina, Tina, Tina. Or should we say Margaritina? Don't tell Mom and Dad. Okay, but it's gonna cost you. $10,000. Or... you do all our chores for a month! Oh, that's better. That's better. First chore: rinse all the pee out of these boots. And this one needs plunging! Linda: We're back! Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad. How was Cake? Eh... Loved it! It made me so hungry. Now, I'm craving cake. Who wants to cake with me? Gene? No thanks. Ever. Oh, you changed your hair. Or maybe her hair changed her.  Dum dum dum.    There's nothing sweet in here. Maybe I'll have a drink instead. No! No? What's gotten into you, Little Miss Mommy Can't Drink? You did hit those Sambucas pretty hard during intermission, Lin. Hey! If they didn't want you to pound 'em down, they'd give you more than ten minutes, right? Oh, you are drunk, Mom. No, I'm not. Yeah, 'cause you're yelling. I'm talking normal. Hm. Mommy doesn't get drunk. She just has fun. Crackers, where's the crackers? You're coming to bed with me. Come on. (sighs with relief) Hey, Tina, since you crapped out last night, I talked Zeke and Jimmy Junior into cutting and going to the mall. Cutting what? Cutting classes. Come on. You owe me. Sorry, Tammy. I don't want to cut. I thought you might be like this. (gasps) That's my erotic friend fiction! Uh-uh-uh. See, this stays with me. And if you don't stop acting like a prude-a-bega and come to the mall, I'm going to give it to Jimmy Junior! But you said if he ever saw it, he'd never talk to me again. Yeah. It's called a threat. Oh. But I thought we were friends. We are. That's why I'm making you go on a double date with me. Don't be such a boob punch. Okay. But first, let's fix you up. Hello, Glamsterdam. Now we're ready to go to the mall. Ollie (screams): Bathroom clowns! much better than being in school right now? Yeah. Hell, yeah! I guess. Jimmy Junior, what do you think of Tina's new look? Pretty trash-tastic, huh? Yeah, I mean... sort of. Piercing booth! Y'all do nips or scrotes? Tina, let's get our tongues pierced! I-I don't want to pierce my tongue. Yes, you do. No, I really don't. Jimmy Junior, you can read, right? Yeah. Mr. School. Not really. Fine. I'll do it. But I only have three dollars and a coupon for my dad's restaurant. Okay. What can we get for that? I can give you temporary tattoos. Temp tramp stamps! Where's Tina? She should be doing this. I'm so tired of being hurt by her. It's a bunch of grown-ups playing patty-cake. I don't get it, Bob. Then you don't get me, Teddy. You don't get me. Oh, he's been slapping everything since we got back from that show. It's called "caking," Lin. You know. You were there. No, I don't know. No. I fell asleep. Come on. Do it with me. No! My hands still hurt from yesterday. Teddy? How about you? Put up your hands. No, thank you. I just kind of want to cake with somebody! All right. Ow! I don't like it, I don't like it. Stop! Keep your hands up! I don't like it! I don't like this! Keep 'em up! Just stop! Just stop, Bob. I don't like it. Don't lower your hands, Teddy! You're scaring him. Oh... He's crying. It's not fun for everyone, Bob. (bell on door chimes) Tina! You're late! You didn't get detention again, did you? No. I'm just late, okay? What is all that goop on your face? And why are you showing so much skin? (sighs) (sighs) Is that a dinosaur over your tar pit? Here you go. What? No. Oh, you want us to tell Mom and Dad about your margarita party? And your new tat? Uh... no, I'll do it. Oh, okay! And when you're done here, change my litter box. And don't tell Mom and Dad about my litter box. Tina! There you are. I told Zeke and Jimmy Junior that we'd hang out at the park tonight, and you'd bring margaritas. No, Tammy, I can't. Ah! Tina! Can't you tell that Jimmy Junior likes the new you? Yeah, I guess. Then why do you keep fighting it? I wish I didn't have to force you have fun. Sorry. You know what? Let's see what happens when we lose the glasses. They kind of make your face look like math class. Thank you? No, math class is bad. Oh. There we go. That's so much better, right? Yeah. Ah! Oh, no. Ow. Tina? Tina? What the hell is going on? I wasn't sneaking out. Try again! Over here. Woo-hoo! What happened to your glasses? And where were you going with my margarita mix? I was just gonna meet some people at the park. What? (phone buzzing) Hold on. The emergency phone's buzzing. "Where are you?" Who the hell is texting the emergency phone? It's my friend Tammy. What? Can I just text her back? She'll be really mad if I don't. No! You may not text her back, or anyone. Mom! Stop being a boob punch. Boob punch? Your mother's not being a boob punch, Tina. That's it. You're grounded. (Tina sighs, phone buzzes) "Your three is grass." I don't get it. Oh. "Your ass is grass." It's not funny. I didn't say it was funny. I just said I figured it out. (tap) (tap) Why weren't you at the park? I looked like an idiot! I'm sorry. I got grounded. You wrecked my chances with Zeke. That's actually good, Tammy. Zeke's really gross. I don't feel that way! Please don't give my journal to Jimmy Junior. Oh, I'm not. Oh, good. Yeah, no, I'm going to read your freak fiction out loud to everyone tomorrow during lunch. No, you can't. It includes material that may not be suitable for all ages. (fakes crying): Don't worry. No one's going to hear all the nasty details over the judgmental laughing! You're going down, Tina! (moans) Tina, hurry up. You might be grounded, but you still got to go to school, little lady. Mom, I have a fever. It says you're done if you're a pork loin. Meat thermometer? What, are you new here? Well, let's go, little piggy. Off to school! I can't go to school today. Why? Because. Why? Because Tammy stole my erotic friend fiction. She's gonna read it out loud during lunch today. Everyone's gonna laugh at me and think I'm a freak, especially Jimmy Junior. (crying) Aw... Is that why you've been acting so bad lately? Yeah. She's blackmailing me. Blackmail? No one blackmails our sister but us! Yeah! Messing with Tina is a privilege, not a right. All right, you two, scoot. I need some private time with Tina. Tina... Tammy can't embarrass you. The only one who can embarrass you is you. Yeah? And you're a creative, imaginative girl. You just be you, and Tammy can go sit in syrup. Let the bees get her. What about Jimmy Junior? He's into dancing, right? He probably likes the artsy-fartsy girls like you. Maybe you're right, Mom. Yeah, of course I'm right. I've got nothing to be embarrassed about. No, you do not. I'm going to write the most erotic, graphic, freakiest friend fiction ever. All right! Freaky friend fiction! And I'm gonna read it to the whole school myself. That's the Tina I know! C'mere.  My little baby's back  My teeny Tina.  Louise: Yeah, that's right. Put on that pretty, pretty lipstick, Tammy. Then kiss you ass goodbye with it. Yeah! Unless you lived inside of Mom, you can't mess with Tina. We're Belchers, from the womb to the tomb! We need to get that backpack and steal the journal back from her. Hello. Andy, can I take your backpack on a walk? We'll be back in two minutes. My backpack's gonna miss your backpack. We'll get through this. Sorry, gotta frisk you for weapons. Ugh. You got brownie all over me, jerk. She's clean. (toilet flushes) Ooh, yikes. Try some club soda. Oh, thanks so much. Was I talking to you? (laughing): I guess you weren't. Ha ha ha ha! Sucker. I got the goods. On to the cafeteria to save Tina! And get me another browie! So Tina's rotten friend Tammy threatened to read Tina's private writing in front of the whole school. But we had a talk, and Tina's feeling better, so... What'd you tell her? I told her she's very creative, and not to be embarrassed, no matter what. Well, that's good advice. Yeah. And then Tina had a great idea. She's gonna read her erotic friend fiction out loud to the whole class herself. Tina's gonna read her erotic friend fiction out loud at school? That's a great idea? Huh. When you say it like that, it doesn't sound as good as when I said it with Tina. Right, 'cause she's gonna read... Both: ...erotic friend fiction out loud at school. out loud... Loud... at school. At school! Oh, my God! What have I done? I'll drive. Attention, everybody. It's time for announcements. The first one is from our new student, Tammy Larson. Good afternoon, everybody. (clears throat) I would like to present to you a... What the hell? Cool! Mom packed tampons for lunch! Ooh, share! I have an announcement. It's an erotic friend fiction story that I just wrote. I hope you like it, because you're all in it. It's called "Buttloose." This is even better. Tina! Tina! We got your journal back from your best friend slash enemy. I don't need it anymore. (clears throat) "It was lunch time at Wagstaff." Tina: Touching butts had been banned "by the horrible Headmaster Frond." What? No... no, no, no. "Suddenly, Tina Belcher appeared in the doorway." She knew what she had to do. She grabbed Jimmy Junior's butt, "and changed the world." Okay, Tina, that was a great story. Now let's pass back the mike. "Everyone began to touch each other's butts. "Omar touched Jocelyn's butt. "Chad the Zombie "touched the butt of that girl with the frosted hair from my art class. I think her name is Kristi." It's Katie, and ew. "Even the horrible Headmaster Frond touched Ms. Jacobson's butt." What? (stammering) Tina: "Everyone touched each other's butts, and it was great." All right, come here. Come here, come here. Come here. Come here, come over here. "And then Tammy came up to Tina "and said, 'Sorry for everything.' Okay... "Tina said, "That's okay. Let's go to the movies next week." "The End." Linda: Tina! Don't read your friend fiction! But I just finished it. You're a freak! (laughing) (farts loudly) Ooh. Tammy farted! Oh, my God! My ears can smell it! Laugh fart, laugh fart! Tammy made a blammy! Ha ha ha! Gross! No! It... I didn't do it. It wasn't my butt. (farts) That wasn't me. (farting) No! Oh, ow, ow, ow. That one hurt. That wasn't me! (fading into distance): I didn't do it. (crying, farting) Why are you guys here? I realized maybe reading your friend fiction in front of everyone wasn't the best idea. It turned out okay, I think. No. No. Honey... No, I think it did. No. No, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life. I think people liked it. Man, that girl really farted, huh? Hey, Tina. Was the Jimmy Junior in your story supposed to be me? Oh, uh... it's a really common name. Yeah. It is. Cool story. Thanks. Tina, what was that... Bob? You're a patty daddy? I love cake! Want to cake with me? Oh. You know, I'm really not a fan. A patty cake, a patty cake, a baker's man! Woo! Okay, all right. Work it! That's it. Got it! More! Low! Oh! High! Down! Uh, you guys gotta take this outside. Let's take it outside. Okay, let's go. Hi, see you later. Okay... Having your parents at school. There's nothing more embarrassing than that.
Welcome back to Get On Up with Chuck and Pam. Flu season is right around the corner. So our local beauty expert will be here to show you how to look hot, even if you have a cold. (sultry voice): Ah-choo. Gesundheit. (laughing) Gesundheit. Are they the cutest couple on TV or what, Gene? Yeah, if you like white people. Now look away, Mom. What? Why? Dad's hogging the bathroom so I'm using the guest bathroom! Ugh, Gene. Come on, you've let me do it before! Fine. But move the dishes. (sighs happily) Aw, Gene! That's my spot! That's funny. It smells like my spot. (sniffs) Asparagus! I've been using the toilet like an idiot. Announcer: Are you a fisherman who hates fish? A pediatrician who hates kids? We want to talk to you. Also, want to be part of our new cooking segment? If you're a local chef, send us a tape! (gasps) Oh, my God... B-Bob! Get in here! What? What is it? You gotta make an audition tape to do a cooking segment for Get On Up! Oh, no. I don't... I don't think so. Oh, come on, Bob. You'd be great! No, no, that's... that's not for me. I mean, sure, it'd be fun to be a celebrity chef, but... Whoa. Whoa! Whoa. What? When did a cooking segment turn into being a celebrity chef? That's not what I meant. I meant cooking segment. Forget it. Rachael Ray over here. With bigger hips. Stop it. Go to school. Fine! As long as we're giving orders, put some clothes on! Leave something to the imagination, for God's sakes! Is no one going to comment on my Sasquatch mask? Middle child. Anything for attention. Where'd you get the mask from? No. No. No! Thanks for asking. Peter Pescadero. He said he'd give it to me if I taught him how to pop and lock. Lucy Lock-it lost her Pop-it. Now you. Lucy Lock-it lost her... What kind of a god would give you those legs and no rhythm?! This mask is gonna make me the new "it" kid. As in, "What is it?" "It's that kid in the mask." "Ohh..." Linda: Come on! Let me film you! No. Yes. No. No. Yes. Yes! Fine! Yay! Kids, we're making an audition tape for your father. Hello, Gene. You look intriguing today, son. Why, thank you, Mother! Yeah, yeah, yeah, come on. (growls) Okay, are you ready? Action! (sighs) Okay. So, uh, I am preparing the Onion-tended Consequences burger. Now, first you have to caramelize the onions. And no, I don't mean add caramel. Ha! Heh. Then you add some fresh thyme, which I have right here. Then it's time to add the goat cheese. And voilà¡. (yells) Notice me! Linda: And cut. Got a little weird at the end, but they'll get the idea. Honey, why don't you take that off, huh? Take what off? This is me now! Heard that before. This is me now! This is me now. This is me now! (phone rings) Hello? Yes, he's right here. Bob! Bob! It's Get On Up! Uh, hello. You loved it? Ooh! Really? Ah! Uh, that's great. Oh! Of course I can come in. Ohh! Bring the whole family? Woo! Um, sure. I can cook the... Oh. Okay, bye. (Bob screams) Ah! Ha-ha! Cooking segment! Cooking segment! Cooking segment! Linda: Oh! Whoa. (clears throat) I mean, it's um, you know, it's gonna be good for the restaurant. Yeah. That's the important thing. But we can still jump up and down! Linda: Ahh-ha-ha! We're doing it. Oh, my God. Woo! Yay. Should he be sweating like that? Bob: Ow. Ow. Okay stop. Linda: Oh, my God, this is so exciting! (sing-song): I know. Hi, you must be Bob. I'm Kevin. Let's introduce you to Chuck and Pam. Don't ask them any questions, obviously. And don't touch them, but also don't make too much eye contact. Everybody's friendly... Bob! We just loved your tape. Well, some of us did. Oh, hello. Are you a little bunny? (sniffing) (whispering): I smell fear on you. Okay. I don't like that one. So, Bob, you'll stand over here, and then we'll put Gene here. Huh? What? Chuck: Yeah. Exactly like in the tape. I knew it! I mean, I had no idea, but... yes! No, no, no, no, no. It's great. It's like when they got a chimp on The Today Show. Yeah, that was in the '50s, but sure, let's base all our decisions on that. I think it could go viral! (gasps) I'm gonna have two little stars! Oh, great. Chuck: Well, I don't know about you, Pam, but that is certainly some of the cutest baby panda footage I've ever seen. Oh. So I'll do all the talking and you just nod, all right? Yes. Check. And entertain the crap out of everybody. No, no, no, not that. Okay, just... Blow their minds. Got it. Gene, stop it. Don't do that. I got it. Go, go, go, go, go, go. Okay, and now it is time for our new segment, "Hey, Good Cookin'." And today's chef is Bob of Bob's Burgers. And who is this furry fella? I'm... the Sasquatch Kid! No wait, Burgerfoot! No, Beefsquatch! Right. Um... And today, uh... we're making the Bruschetta Bout it Burger. So we start with some fresh mozzarella, and some basil... Mm, mm, mm. Gene. Stop it. Pop-it-lock-it- pop-it-lock-it. And then we, uh, add some oil and vinegar to these, and... I want beef! Oh. (gobbling) (laughing) Beefsquatch likey like. (laughs) (laughs) (laughs) Ha ha ha! Beefsquatch. (gobbling) Oh, boy. Beefsquatch! So they want Bob and Gene back next week. They said it got the most response of any segment since they showed Pam getting her tubes tied. The fallopians on that woman! Eh... Bob, you excited or what? Bobby? No, Teddy. I'm not. Why not? He's just mad 'cause he thinks Gene Beefsquatched all over his special moment. Don't, Lin. Don't use that as a verb. It's just... it's not what I envisioned, Teddy. 'Cause it was horrible. It was great! I knew this mask was powerful! So, who wants to touch and/or be touched by a famous person? Can I please have my mask back? No! I explicitly said no backsies, Peter. In this country, no backsies means something! Now go pop and lock! But I don't want to do it anymore. Go! Lucy Lock-it lost her Pop-it... (sighs) (Gene whistling) Brush, brush, brush. Bob: Gene. Hmm? I need you to do something for me. It's... It's important. I'm not pulling out your long eyebrow hairs again, Dad. No, it's not... Wait, are they back? Oh, yeah. Yeesh, that is bad. Anyway, I was thinking maybe, um, could you, uh, tone it down out there a little? Like, uh, let me explain the recipe? Try to entertain 'em a little? Sounds crazy, but you got it, Dad. Great. I'll just wait for you to succeed or fail. Thanks. Could go great, could be a disaster... Okay. I got it. Psst. Psst. Hi. Hi. My mom lets me come to all the show tapings, as long as it doesn't interfere with school work. It does. Okay. You're a VIP, right? Did you get to meet Pam? Who, the host lady? Yeah. (moaning) Are you okay? I'm fine. So did you, like, I don't know, taste her hair or anything? No. I didn't think of that. I guess I could have. (moaning) She was swooshing her hair all around. (moaning) I'm gonna turn this way. (moaning) So to make our Mediterr-Ain't- Misbehavin' Burger, we have some feta cheese... Mmm. Mmm. And, uh, of course some eggplant... Hmm. Yum. Uh, actually, these eggplants were freshly laid by the chickenplant this morning. (Bob chuckles) Anyway, so with these... Uh, Pam, why don't you give the audience a chance to get the joke. Chickenplant. (laughs politely) (clears throat) (hums) Oop, I think this one's hatching right now. (hums nervously) I'll save you, boring cook! (laughing) Beefsquatch! (laughs) Okay, okay, that'll be $5. Throw in another five and he'll burp in your face. Wow! Look at all these people that came 'cause of the show, Bobby! Uh-huh. Oh, my God, it's great for the restaurant, just like you wanted! Yeah, it's all just how I wanted it. Mm-hmm. Hey. Nice dish tub. Thanks. You want to go out? Wow, you must really like dish tubs. Are you that boy from the studio audience? Shh-shh-shh. Look, there's something here. We both know it. Let's just take it and run with it. Um... Okay. Could be worse. "Could be worse." (fake laugh) Guess who's gonna get an arm put around them? Me? (both laugh awkwardly) Can I get your autograph? There you go, Toots. Beefsquatch signed it. Oh, my God! I'll sign it. Ow! "Keep sizzling. Bob." There you go. Who are you? Who are you, huh? Old man freak. You idiot kid. Linda: Oh, my God, I can't believe we were invited to Chuck's pool party. (laughs) It'll be swarming with celebrities! Remember, they're just normal people like you and me. Oh, my God, it's local weatherman Scott Bags! Scott! Say "cold front!" Say "cold front!" Linda. Stop it. Cold front! What? He's the weatherman! Last one in the pool is Tina! Ah! Hey... Oh. Hey, hey! You guys made it! Come on, Linda. Let's get tanked! Yeah. Uh, thanks for, uh, inviting us, Chuck. You're in the inner circle, Bob. Think of us as your family now. Okay. So, you and Linda swing? Uh, no. (chuckling): Okay. I'll take that as a yes. Wink. No, I... Steve's wife! You likey? Um. No? Why not? Body? Face? (clears throat) Both. Okay. Hey, Steve, you likey? Um, Chuck... Hey, be open to it. Be open to it. I really don't think this... I thought I told you you were in the inner circle. Right. And the only rule in the inner circle is that you're open to it, so if Steve's in... Oop, Steve's not interested anyway, never mind. We're divorced, you know. What? Mm-hmm. (gasps) Oh, my God, you're divor... I can't believe that. Yeah, we are. You two look so happy on TV. Ugh. What happened? Fame! No. Yes. No. Yes. Fame's great, I thought. Fame tears families apart. No. What? That, and the fact that I refuse to live in a house with low-flush toilets. I deserve the full flush, Linda. Of course you do, honey. Thank you. Yeah. (toilet flushes) Bob: Damn it. (flushes again) Stupid toilet. I'm Bob from Bob's Burgers. Eggplants come from chickenplants. (laughs as Beefsquatch) Hilarious! That's so Bob! Nailed it, Beefsquatch! Hey. Are you making fun of me? No. No, Dad. No. That mask has turned you into a real jerk, Gene! I think you mean megastar. Oh, my God, they're making a scene. You two stop it! No. Let them fight. Everybody look that way. There she goes. (vomiting) Maybe I should just quit. Do it! Leave the entertaining to the pros... meaning me and other people with masks! No, you know what? It's time for you to learn a lesson. Watch your back, Beefsquatch. Why don't you watch it for me? 'Cause I'll be shaking it right in your face! And it'll look like this! Ba-baba- bo-bo-eh-eh... (laughs) It's not funny, Chuck! It's pretty funny! I'm gonna make this show a living nightmare for you. You're gonna wish you'd never been born, meaning I wouldn't be born! What can I get my favorite father-son team? Separate dressing rooms.   Separate dressing rooms. And a piñata and large satin pillows. Now! And Greek yogurt. Two-percent for me. Just the plain is fine for both of us! Louise! Psst! Come here! I'm trying to sabotage Beefsquatch and I need your help. Well, first of all, I'm flattered... Shush. Is there anything I can do to throw him off his game? Dynamite in the burger. More subtle. C4. Move off explosives. Habanero peppers. A lot of them. Yes! You're a genius! Oh, stop. Get me habanero peppers! I'll call my guy. Ring, ring. Let me talk to him. That's a fake phone. I don't care. What's your name? I don't speak Spanish. I do. Hola, combre se hombre, habanero pepper. Caw, caw, caw! Caw! I get it. I'm in your dressing room. Oh. Listen, I need you to help me sabotage Dad on the show. What a day! I was thinking, what if I mislabeled Dad's utensils? Write, like, "eggbeater" on the spatula, and "oven" on the cutting board. Hmm? Or what if you put superglue on them? Yes! But can you do it? The last time I used superglue, I accidentally glued my wiener to my remote control helicopter. Ah! Oh! Ah! Oh! Oh, oh...! Accidentally on purpose. Hello, my lady. Hello, my boyfriend Nathan. So, how about we take this to the next level? You wanna make out? Okay, on three. One... Ah... No. I mean, take me backstage to meet Pam. Wait, are you only going out with me to get to Pam? Don't tell me how to love you! Nathan, you might be in this for the wrong reasons. I think we should break up. Fine. Throw away the best thing that's ever happened to you. I don't really think this is the best... But know this! I will taste Pam's hair! And there's nothing you can do to stop me! Let's stay friends. It smells like it's time for our favorite segment... "Hey, Good Cookin'"! So, whatcha got cookin' up today, Bob? Well, Chuck, it's the "I'm Gonna Get You Succotash Burger." (chuckles) That's rich. So I'm just chopping up some tomatoes. Mm-hmm. And then I'm going to, uh... You all right there? Yeah. Mm-hmm. That's funny. I'll hold onto that. Well, why don't we just get the burger on the bun? How 'bout that, Chuck? Okay. Gene! All: Beefsquatch! Beefsquatch! Beefsquatch! Beefsquatch! Beefsquatch! Beefsquatch! Beefsquatch! Well if it isn't Mr. Spatula Knife Hands! Oh, hi, Beefsquatch. Go ahead. Have a burger. Don't mind if I do! (grunts, screaming) (laughing) I put peppers in it! You b*st*rd! I'm gonna get you for this! Bring it on, Beefcrotch! (screams) (screams) (laughter) (spitting): Kitty litter! What a crazy couple weeks, huh? Anyone want to talk about it? I just got out of a serious relationship. Tina, shush. Well, I am doing great! How about you, son? Great here, Dad. Why don't you give me a big hug! Love to. That would be great. (both grunting) Linda: Oh, bullhonk! Pam warned me about this when she was binge-drinking. She said fame destroys families. And this family's going right in the crapper. So that is why... I think you two should quit the show. Tell him to quit. Tell him to quit. Him! Him! Well, I quit! The dirty tricks department is closed! What are you talking about? Nothing. Forget it. Hey, we had some good times, didn't we? Were you helping him? Were you helping him? Jinx. Yeah, I'm out! I'm sick of your dark, twisted games. I'm going to go take a shower. Wash this filth off me. Filthy! Filthy! Look, if you guys aren't gonna quit, then I'm gonna go talk to Chuck and Pam myself! Pam and I are tight! She'll put an end to this. No. What? But what about all that stuff you said about fame destroying relationships? That's just something famous people say. Look, we've struck gold here, and I will be damned if I'm gonna let some mama bear come in here and ruin it! So unless you work for the network or the affiliate or the FCC, I can legally pretend that you don't exist. Well, you're not getting rid of this mama bear so easy! Yes, I am. Security. Hey! Oh, ooh, ooh, ah, ooh! Chuck: Hey, you see those guys over there with the untucked dress shirts? I'll go tuck 'em in. No, no. They hate that. That's the VP and assistant VP of programming. They're talking about a spin-off. A spin-off? Your own show, guys, with me producing. It could be bigger than Get On Up. Well, bigger than Get On Down, which is the midnight rebroadcast of Get On Up. We're gonna be moderately wealthy! I could date someone half my age... five-and-a-half-year-old starlet. Yeah, so it would really seal the deal if you guys would, you know, physically attack each other a little bit. Or a lot. Interesting. Sure. Mm-hmm. Makes perfect sense, right? It's a cooking segment, so, yeah. Great! And physical violence on three. I'm not doing it. One, two, three. Physical violence! Physical violence! Have you seen my mom anywhere? Yeah, I threw her out. But that's funny. I just let you go backstage a second ago. Huh. I wonder where I was going? Nathan: Just let me taste it! Get off of me! Hey, Tina, check out Tina. Nathan! No! No, no, no. What is going on?! Let me go! I don't think that... we can stay friends. Security! Hey, Mom. What the...? Oh, sorry. This is my ex-boyfriend, Nathan. Aw, you two couldn't make it work? No, we couldn't make it work. No. And eight, and nine, and ten... Pam: Oh, wow! Chuck: Looking mazel-tough, Exercise Rabbi. Pam: Call the fire department 'cause my buns are burning! Speaking of buns, I think I can smell some. And it must be time for... "Hey, Good Cookin'"! So, what's cookin', Bob? Well, Chuck, it's the Every Breath You Tikka Masala Burger. (chuckles) We start with a little coconut milk. Mm-hmm. Right? There it is. There's the coconut milk. No one cares. And then, some curry paste... You want me to even pick it up 'cause no one's listening? Whatever, whatever. Just move it along. So, yeah, that's curry paste. Gene: I'm bored up here! Yeah, should I go to the next ingredient or just...? Beefsquatch! Beefsquatch! Beefsquatch! Beefsquatch! More scotch. Beefsquatch! Gene: My ears are burning! Beefsquatch took you down! That's it! Beef fight! Beef fight! Beef fight! Come here, beef boy! (Gene yelling) No matter what, don't stop rolling. (both grunting) Oh, my God! They're gonna k*ll each other! On TV! Are you not entertained?! No... a little. Not you! Oh, stop it! Stop it! Oh, Louise, Tina, Boy-Tina, we gotta get in there! Anyone want to help me throw this through the window? You're a bad, bad boy! It stinks in here! Bob, Gene, look at yourselves! You're father and son! You're supposed to love each other, not k*ll each other. This isn't the Bible! This show has torn my mily apart long enough! It ends now! Kids, cover your ears. FCC, here comes Linda! Dagnabbit, pee popper, nuts to poppa, stinka boob taka, momma kaga, poopa daddy! What was that? I'm cursing on live TV! Uh, those aren't curse words. Not even close. Okay. Well, how 'bout this? No, no! No nudity! No nudity! (screams) Aw, sick! This is to save my family! A-boobity- boobity-boobity-boo! Wow. Whoa! Whoa. DVR! DVR! You said to keep rolling. We're done. We're done. Yeah, by the way, the same thing happened with the chimp on The Today Show. Shut your mouth! You have a smart mouth. You have a smart mouth. Oh, you shut that. Shove it! Wow. Yeah, no kidding. I can't believe she did that... for us. Yeah, milk, saving families. What can't breasts do? Milking the cow! Milking the cow! Listen, I'm sorry, Gene, about everything. I let the whole TV thing go to my head. No, I'm sorry. This thing turned me into a monster! But I'm not a monster! I'm a real boy! Come on, Dad! Solidarity! Oh, God. (chuckles) Gene, you have let yourself go. Bobida-boobida- bop-bop-bop-ba! Ah, okay, well, now, now we stopped rolling. So there's no need for you... Ah, what the hell. Boobity-boobity-ba-bida-ba. Ha-ha! I love you, Dad! I love you, too, son! I love you, Pam! Reporter: And so, facing major fines from the FCC, this long-running talk show may have had its last word. Just a little too (chuckles) titillating. Well, you two may be regular, unfamous schmucks now, but at least this family's back to normal. Amen! You said it! Single and ready to mingle. Yeah. And thanks, Lin, for showing us some perspective. Among other things. Show's over, Teddy. Come on. Sorry, Lin. It's just, ah, you imagine something for so long, and then what you thought was pink is brown, and what you thought was symmetrical is not. It's just unsettling. Teddy, please. Gene, what'd you do with your mask? Did you throw it in a volcano? Nah. I gave it back to Peter Pescadero. I promised him he would pop and lock his way to a better life, and I did not deliver. Another child left behind. Well, it's certainly nice to have the old Gene back. (farting sound) What? I said it's nice to have the old... (farting sound) It's nice... Okay, I'm done talking to you.
Oh! Oh... Uh! What? (gasps) No! Lin, you gotta stop reading the police blotter. It just makes you mad. Why would someone steal the sign for Ball Street? Oh. (laughs) Oh, God, what is this town coming to? It's going to crap. Tell me about it. Somebody threw a snow cone at my windshield today. I thought I hit a rainbow. It was terrifying. Oh, come on. I don't think this town is going to crap. (engines roaring) That's my 2:00. The One Eyed Snakes motorcycle club. Their chapter president died gruesomely. I'm doing the service. That explains why you're wearing leather pants. Been waiting forever to bust these out. He looks like Prince. He looks like fat, white Prince. Mort: Look, but don't touch, fellas. (boy grunting) Oh, no, these are the guys who took over the Steps. I heard they pick on kids. Wait. I'm a kid! Come on. Let's take the long way. I'm not afraid of some high school kids. Watch a-this. (humming nonchalantly) Hey, hey. You can't walk here. Oh, my gosh, I can't walk here? Oh, look, it's a miracle! I'm walking! Shut your butts, coconuts. But you said I couldn't, but I'm doing it. But I want your butt to shut. Oh, listen to the hum of my butt. (humming) Oh, listen to this: clap, clap shut, clap it shut! See ya later! Have a great life! They're just little acne-covered kittens. (mimics g*nshots) Meow, meow, meow! (g*nshots) Meow!   This memorial jam has been going on for 21 minutes. I just wonder if I should fade it out. This was Horny Dave's favorite jam. Keep it cranked. Horny Dave's favorite jam? This is my favorite jam. Keep it cranked, Eddie! (bottle breaks) Oh, God, don't come here, no, no, no, no. Welcome! You serve beer? We... do not. What's that? That is beer. Sorry, we do. I lied. Let's drink to Horny Dave. To Horny Dave! What are you talking about? Yeah! (laughs) Um, the woman who won that drinking contest, she's pregnant, right? Well, they say in moderation. Hey, man, they don't judge your lifestyle, you buttoned-down pencil pusher. What? Sorry, Bobby, this motorcycle thing's contagious. I kinda want to go out and get a bike tonight. Hassle shopkeepers. "Hey, old man!" You know? "You don't know me. I'll break your window and hit ya with a bat." Sounds like a great idea, Teddy. Ah, maybe not. Probably just watch a hockey game. To Horny Dave! A helluva man! A helluva friend! A helluva lover! Uh, they broke more bottles. Whoa, looks like our restaurant just got a lot edgier. Hope I can still get in. You probably can't. I'll meet you guys after. I like your lid. I like your vest... what's left of it. Yep, these colors have been to hell and back. Part of 'em stayed in hell. What are those pretty buttons? Oh, these patches? Well, we got this one for... tickling a cop. Cool! What's that one for? For not being associated with the white power movement. And what's that one for? For blowing up a bunch... of balloons... for kids like you. Just an ordinary day here at Bob's Burgers, right, kids? Nice place. I'm Critter, by the way. Uh, Bob. Yeah, I'm the, uh, chapter president of these fellas. Horny Dave was, till his grisly d*ath. Well, I'm sure you don't want to talk about it, so... Yeah, he got into a wreck with a semi, all right. Real fiery. Mm-hmm. By the time they pulled him out, his entire lower half, the horny half, was roasted. That's why Horny Dave's vest here is in tatters. Um, it looks nice. No, it doesn't, Bob. No, it doesn't. This vest is supposed to make me look like the unquestioned leader of this club, but instead I, I just look foolish. Mm. Whoa! Statch! Nasty Slim! Cool it! See? Horny Dave was just a better leader. If we were fighting, he'd come out and he'd say, "Let's go cook some meth!" And we would, and we'd forget all our troubles. That sounds nice. Maybe we should cook meth. I wanna forget my troubles. God bless this meth. Kids, go inside. So, uh, that's your old lady, huh? Uh, yeah. She goes by "Linda." Or Dragon. Whichever. So is that your old lady? No, Mudflap was Horny Dave's. She's a special woman. She can open a beer with her boobs. Mine can't do that. It's an art. Tina: Whoa! Ha-ha! Bob: Oh, my! Mm-hmm. Thank you. Thank you. Now I want them. Is that a requirement for being in the club? Wish it was that easy. Initiation was tough. Mudflap beat the snot out of some poser in Macon, Georgia one fine day in spring. Got her colors that night. It was fall. It was spring. I remember because the azaleas were in bloom. Ooh, azaleas. Oh, the azaleas are beautiful in Macon. Second only to their crank. That sweet Macon crank. Oh. What's crank? Like meth's dirty cousin. Oh, we're gonna cook meth. Oh... ha-ha. Okay, time for bed, sweeties. Come on. Can I bring a biker with me to tell me stories? No, you may not. Please...? Just one! No. All right, everybody. We drank the place dry. Let's ride! Biker: Come on, lil' sweetheart. Jump on back. I'm sure they have designated drivers, so... This should cover the damage. Sorry there's blood on some of it. Huh. Oh... Oh, one last thing. Here. What's this? Means we owe you one. Put it in your window. Nobody will mess with you. Uh, except maybe the Buzzard Kings. They might throw a Molotov cocktail in here. You call me if they do. Uh! No, no. Right in the window. So, we've got this now. Gene: Uh-oh, we're crossing paths again. We're crossing paths! Hey, remember when I told you not to come around here? Guess not. I'm not so good with history. Me, neither! I'm pretty good at history, but I have some problems with math. Well, I'm taking a course in the future. You know what happens in the future? We walk right past you. Uh! I just want no little kids around me when I'm decompressing after school. I'm trying to create a relaxed environment, I'm making my friends feel comfortable, and then you come by with all ts attitude! Hey, you don't want to mess with my sister. She'll wear down your self-esteem over a period of years. Mm-hmm. Shut up, four-eyes. Oh. I'm talkin' to four-ears. With four ears, I can ignore you twice as hard. What, what? What, what? You've pushed me to the point of break. I'm confiscating these. (Louise screams) (both gasp) Laters! What just friggin' happened?! So, I couldn't help notice someone doesn't have their bunny ears on. Ha-ha! I know, right? It's, uh, been a pretty long time since we've seen you without your... Too long! Too... long! Okay. Louise, maybe you'd feel better if you told Mom and Dad... How happy I am? Mom, up high. Hey! Oh! I'll take one. You got it, bro! Whoo! Whew. Oh. Geez. Do you think I should go talk to her, Bobby? No, you shouldn't! I'm great! Just fantastic! (door slams) Uh, maybe wait. (school bell rings) You're not wearing your ears today. Or are they invisible? Ha-ha-ha! Invisible?! Where do you come up with this stuff? Your mind is so beautiful! Yeah, take it in! Whoa, Louise, not wearing your bunny ears? This is big. Lots of issues to discuss, feelings to process. Oh, yeah, tell me about it, Mr. Frond! I am processing up a storm, but I could really use a processing-partner! Me?! Great idea! Your office? Five minutes? Yeah! I'm out of here. I'm gonna wait for that punk at the Steps and get my ears back. We'll come with you. No. You guys go home and lie to Mom and Dad. Good. I'm a liar, not a fighter. Louise, wait. What? You want us to keep your dinner warm? Yeah. Real warm. Hello, I see you're wearing my ears. Oh, they're off-center a smidge. Let me just... (shrieks) Nice try, kid. Fine. We're all young professionals here. I'm Louise, by the way. I-I don't think I got your name. Logan. Logan... what's this in my pocket? Oh, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine dollars for the hat. You can't buy me like a cheap s*x lady! (yells) (chuckles) Too slow, down low. Why don't you go back to plan-school because looks like you need a better one. Why don't you go to plan-school?! Why don't you? Why don't you? No, you, why don't you? Why don't you?! No, why don't you? Why don't you?! What do we do with this card? Take it down? It's creepy. Are you crazy? Remember when you took down that charity jar? You saw how pissed those breast cancer people got. Hey, parentals. Where's Louise? Um... Hat shopping? Shopping for hats. Huh, that makes sense. I guess Louise needs to transition from bunny ears to something. Like training wheels. Like when we got a fish for Gene to prove he was responsible enough to get a dog. I was not. That poor fish. So, where are we going? My calendar is wide open. Yeah, well, uh, I'm home now. So, run along, little doggie. No, we're home now. Until I get those ears back, wherever you go, I go. Going to school, Logan? I'll join you. Let's do it. (yells) Nope. Logan, Logan, Logan, Logan. What do you do? You go to your locker before you go to class or you go to class? Gotta pee? What's the routine here? You know, I could pee... in the boys' room. Well, you think I won't go in there? I'm not giving up, Logan. I will wear you down. I got a prom date because of these ears. My practice S.A.T. scores went up. I'm not giving up, either. Whoo! It stinks in here. Welcome to boys' smell. Logan! I like your bunny ears. Thanks, Shanaya. Louise: They're not his ears! (yells) Oh, sorry you had to leave so soon! Let the record show that I tried to reason with you, Logan! Now I have to go nuclear! Can I help you? I hope I'm not interrupting dinner, ma'am, but your son... (sighs) he stole something of mine. Logan! You took this girl's bunny ears? I didn't want to tattle, but you left me no choice. Yeah. I took 'em. Return them. Now. I threw 'em away. I told you you'd never get 'em back. Bull, you threw them away. Search my room. Ugh, Logan. Sorry, I'll write you a check. $20? 0 seems a bit high, honey. Oh, God, Tom. Not now! Where did you throw them away? Pancho's Tacos. Which one, Logan? It's a chain! The good one. The one on Riverside. Uh, kid, what you're looking for was incinerated. It's gone. Pfft. Burned up. Sorry. No! (sobbing)   (laughing crazily) Revenge. Is this it? No! Are these it? It's pink with ears. Oh, then they're gone. It's a hat. No. Then they're gone. Hey, I remember this hat. It was gonna be my thing. Remember? I could pull this off. Right? Um... yeah, of course you can! There she is, my little big girl. Tina and Gene told us you were in the market for an in-between hat, so we dug some out of the closet. Maybe not this one. You probably don't want this one. How thoughtful of you all, but I don't need a hat to complete me. I'm all I need. Just me. That's what I keep telling you. Good night, Linda. Thank you for thinking about me. You're welcome. All I need is that hat! Mine! Logan: Look who it is. Surprised you don't have pig ears on, the way you squeal. (laughs) Ha! Ha! Ha! Question. How's your hearing? Uh, pretty good. Why? Well, then I guess you can hear that. (motorcycles rumbling) That's the sound of revenge. Uh... For taking that which wasn't yours, I have summoned the wrath of the One Eyed Snakes! Hell hath no fury like... k*ll the bikes for a second! Thank you. Hell hath no fury... Did you hear that part? About hell? Yeah, I think so. Good. 'Cause the rest of it is, "Hell hath no fury like I do, Logan!" You took my ears and threw them away. And now these guys are going to take your ears and throw them away. What? Oh, boy. I'm going to watch through my fingers. No, I'm not. I'm going to look away. I think we're gonna have to lay low for a little while after this. Oh, God, don't cut my ears off! Ha! Ho! I hate when shirt tags stick out. Here, here, here, here! I never threw them out, okay? (crying): I'm so sorry! M-My ears. Please don't cut off my ears! Leave 'em where they are. They... they look good in that position. Can I look yet? Nee-ya... I'll let you know. My hands smell like onions. It's nice. Don't ever mess with us again, Logan. Now, get the hell outta here! Ah! Yeah! That's how you do it! That's how you do it! (motorcycle rumbles) No, no, no, no, we just got the place back together. (engines rumbling, bikers laughing, talking) Welcome back, fellas. How are you? Linda: Kids? What's going on? Louise, you're wearing your ears again. Yeah, some kids stole 'em and these mamma-jammas got 'em back! Mamma-jammas, what? Your ears were stolen? Yup. I cashed in the card the One Eyed Snakes gave us. Good to see you again, Bob. Nice hat. Ah, really? Yeah, you think so? Oh, and I told them food and drinks are on the house. No. They... that's... No. I don't think that's... Ya hear that, boys? Go crazy! All right! Yay! No. No. No, no, no. All right, let's go crazy. Please don't go crazy. (talking, laughing) Um, can I help you folks? Yes. We are parents in this community, and we're marching on your filthy, dangerous biker bar. We're not a biker bar. You are serving beer to a ton of bikers. Tom, please. This biker bar is the reason our town is going down the tubes. And we will not allow violence against our children to continue. Violence! Violence? What violence? Those bikers wanted to cut off my ears. Oh, God. Ah, calm down, we weren't gonna cut off any ears. Don't listen to him. He would have. No, I wouldn't. Yeah, you would. I'm tellin' ya, I would not... I think you would have. You don't know my mind! You see, I was just teachin' these little bullies a lesson. So this is the brat who picked on my Louise, huh? Let me tell you something, Miss Priss. Lin... No. I got this. These bikers aren't the problem in this town; it's your kids. They're a bunch of animals. Yeah, lady! Control your kids. Oh, it is your kids who cannot be controlled. She's right. I'm out of control. Oh, why don't you go fart in a phone booth! (making fart noises) All right, Lin, calm down. You tell this hussy to calm down. Yeah, calm it, hussy! Do not call my wife a whore. Oh, I will not calm it. (grunts) Biker: Love a catfight. Ah! Ooh. (grunting) Lin, stop... Ah! Don't do this... Ooh... Pull out her highlights, Mom. All right, all right, everybody just calm down. Ah! (gasping, murmuring) Pick that up, apologize and leave. Please. For your own good. I will do no such thing. Shoulda left when you coulda left. Everyone who's got a knife, grab it! It's a fight to the d*ath! (murmuring) Hey, hey, you can't fight these people, Critter. You'll... you'll destroy them. When somebody messes with the One Eyed Snake's colors, they gotta pay. My leadership's on the line. I got no choice... we gotta hurt these people. Would Horny Dave have his men beat up some white collar parents? Horny Dave is dead. All right, it's goin' on now, here it goes. They're just bluffing. The One Eyed Snakes don't bluff. Neither do the Belcher kids! Except when we do. Yeah! Let's keep shouting stuff! Screw inside voices! Okay, I'm calling the police. Tom: No! My running mix! Oh, enough talk. Let's kick... (groans) Mudflap, are you okay? I'm fine, it was just a contraction. Let's... (groans) Contraction? You're in labor? Hold that kid in till we're done! I'll try. (groaning): No, I can't. This baby's coming. Oh, this baby's coming. I'll call an ambulance. I'm a doctor. Well, then get the hell over here! All right. Get under the hood and check the oil, Doc. (groans) Okay. Okay, okay. Uh, how far apart are the contractions? They are not. Oh! Wow. Okay. This baby is coming now. Like right into my hand. Hang in there, Mudflap, hang in there. Don't forget to breathe. Do you want me to get you a wooden spoon to bite on? Oh, forget the spoon. Get me whiskey. Um, I'm not sure whiskey is... I have a flask in my golf bag. Yeah, I got one here, somewhere... I got some whip-its. Here. Take mine. Hold on a sec. Okay, you're doing great. Uh, what's your name? Mudflap. Oh, Mudflap, uh... that was my grandmother's name. Really? No, no. You're named after a dirty part of a truck. Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay, keep breathing. Okay. And... ready... push! Ugh. Just pretend it's lasagna. (Mudflap groans) I don't know how Mudflap's doing this without an epidura If I didn't have one with Logan? Whoo! Ugh, tell me about it. Those two? Piece of cake. That one? A whole cake. I'm sorry my Logan picked on your kids. Hey. I'm sorry my kids had bikers threaten to cut your kid's ears off. I need you guys to hold up her knees, just like this... Okay. I see the head. (Mudflap groans) Oh, I looked. That's a head. I hope that's a head. I shouldn't have looked. I looked. One more big push, Mudflap! Okay! (groans) Here it comes! (groans) (baby crying) All: Aw. Critter: Look at that. "Not it" to clean the table. It's a boy. Barely. Mudflap, is there someone you'd like to cut the cord? His daddy. But Horny Dave's dead. No, Critter, Horny Dave had a vasectomy in '95. Come here. What are you saying, woman? This baby's yours. I still don't understand. Critter, we had s*x and you knocked me up... Slow down! Slow down! This baby is your spawn. Oh... Wait a minute, what do you mean? (sniffs) You're a daddy. From when? Sometimes the one you slept with nine months ago was right in front of you all along. Oh, Mudflap. Give me that cord. (people exclaiming) Okay, are we gonna have the fight now? Or... Louise, there's gonna be no fight. This little kid squashed a beef better than Horny Dave ever did. My boy. How 'bout that? Here, Creature. Critter. Right. Maybe you could use it as a baby blanket. Oh. Thank you. And thanks for getting your hands dirty, Doc. No problem. Aw. Parents helping bikers who are now parents. See, our town has its problems. But it doesn't mean it's going in the crapper. It just means if we want to be a better neighborhood, we have to be better neighbors to each other. Boo! Boo! Stinks! Okay, Louise, come on. Thanks a lot. It's okay. You were very brave. You stood up for yourself, got help from dangerous bikers, all without your ears. Maybe you don't need them anymore. Maybe. And maybe I know someone who needs them more than me Look, these ears mean a lot to you, Logan, so how about you keep 'em? Really? No friggin' way! I was just messing with you, you idiot! Ah! Oh! Welcome home, ears. Let's get you a beer. Dad, two beers. No. They're for my ears!
So, Bobby, I can't wait to see you and Linda at my Halloween party tonight. I went all out this year. Uh, actually, I'm taking the kids trick or treating tonight, Teddy. So, I probably can't make it. Oh. I noticed here that you, uh, RSVP'd online and you clicked "maybe." Right. Uh, that was kind of a soft maybe. Maybe means maybe, Bob. It doesn't mean "I'm too scared to say no." Uh, uh... I got 42 maybes, Bob! Who can plan for that? (door opens) Linda: There's my little candy corns. Ooh. Sad Wolverine. Scary and sad. I'm Edward Scissor Hands, Mom. Uh, I'm not sure about you walking around with scissors all night, Louise. Why don't you be Edward Spoon Hands? Get real. It's Halloween. Not Hallowuss. And Tina's a mummy. Sexy. Last year I was a mummy. This year I'm a mommy mummy. And I'm single and I'm working two jobs, and I'm just trying to get back out there. Tina, you have to put your costume back on the roll tomorrow. I'm not losing that much TP. Okay. (clears throat) Oh, and Gene looks great, too. Wait, what are you, hon? I'm rapper/actress Queen Latifah from her U.N.I.T.Y. phase. Oh, God, so specific and political. I love it. Mm-hmm. All right, kids, help me close up shop and we can all go trick or treating. Dad, we've decided that this year and in between we trick or treat alone. But you kids love trick or treating with me. That's the best part. Yeah, that's the best part (falsetto): Yeah, that's the best part. Shush, shush. I, I don't know. I mean, it's, it's Halloween. You know, things can get a little weird out there. Oh, just let 'em go, Bobby. C'mon. (sighs) Fine. You can trick or treat by yourselves this year. (cheering) But you stick to o regular route and I want you home by 9:00. Ugh. Hooray! You can come to my party. Oh, right, great. Yay! I wa this to be the sugar high I never come down from. (Gene screams) Okay, bad start. Bad start. Let's keep moving. All: Trick or treat. Uh, here's some oyster crackers. Now get out of here. All: Trick or treat. Is it Halloween? Here, uh, take some deli numbe. You'll be the first in line tomorrow. (knocking) All: Trick or treat. Some delicious seaweed candy from my solo vacation in Singapore. Wrap it up, Charles Dickens. You're not being paid by the word.  I was walking in the graveya...  Bobby. Linda. Oh! Hi, Teddy. Welcome to my Black and Orange party. Teddy, you really went all out. I spray-painted everything this morning. Yeah, it's uh, aittle strong. Maybe we should open a window or something. Yeah, I would, but they're painted shut. Can I offer you a hard-boiled egg? I colored them black and orange with a marker. (high pitched squeak) Whoa. Whoa. Hey. Ooh. What was that? Ooh. No need to be scared, everybody. Just my guinea pig, Francis. You can call her Frankie. But just don't call her Fran. She hates that. What about Francy pants? Saint Francis pants, huh? What's wrong with you? What? Hey, you're not wearing a costume, Bob. I just didn't think I needed to wear a costume. It's not a kids' party. Hey, everybody, we've got (rings bell) a party violation over here. What are you doing? Bob is not wearing a costume. Mike the mailman's not wearing a costume. Mike's a bunny. He's not a bunny. I'm a bunny. You have a cotton ball. He has a cotton ball. On your uniform. It's a great idea. Now we're gonna get you to the costume closet.  Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba  We got some sort of Chewbacca. No. The sun. No. Summer Frankenstein. That's not a thing. And, uh, oh... I think we got a winner here. No, no, no. There, all better. Now, you don't look so ridiculous. I'll trade you two packets of hot sauce for a fortune cookie. Throw in some cough drops and you got a deal. Sold. This town is horrible at Halloween. We're trick or treating by ourselves for the first time ever; we need to get some real candy. Follow me. I know where we can go. We're going where the rich people live. Rich people are better at Halloween. And skin care. That's why we're going to... Kingshead lsland. Ooh. Ooh. Aah, I should have worn more toilet paper. Okay, uh, okay I admit it's a little colder than I thought it would be. Aah, I don't wanna die. I'm not wearing my good underpants and I'd be so embarrassed. (all sigh) Did it just get ten degrees warmer? I think that seagull just winked at me. Hello. Kingshead lsland, nice to meet ya. Now, I trick or treat ya. Tina: Wow, look how clean it is. I could drink from the puddles. I'm going to. Hey, guys. Sweet 'tumes. Costumes. Edward Scissor Hands, cool. Queen Latifah, also cool. Finally, somebody gets it. Toilet paper roll. Nailed it. Mummy. Hey, I'm Milo. I'm Ned. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, is that all candy? Yeah, we already dropped one bag off at home. Now, we're gonna head down Spencer Street. That's where all the good houses are. Funny coincidence. We were also gonna go down Spencer Street. Well, great. I'm gonna eat like a Queen. Come on, Lin, Teddy went to the bathroom. Now's our chance. Let's sneak out of here. But you look so cute. I wanna spank the cake right out of your face. Uh, no. Come on. Teddy: Aah! Oh, my God, oh, my God. Somebody stepped on Francis. Oh, my God, oh, my God. She's not breathing. She's not breathing. Live, damn it, live. Teddy, let me try. I have good lungs. (inhales deeply) (coughing) Somebody do something. Mike, do something. What do you want me to do? I'm a mailman. Aah, Mike's a mailman! Oh, God. Come on, move those legs, Francis. Move those legs. Oh, I saw it. I saw it move. Move those... She's alive. Come on. Oh, no, she's dead. No, she's dead. Somebody stepped on Francis. And then did nothing. Nothing! Teddy, how do you know someone stepped on her? Guinea pigs aren't flat, they don't just look like this in the wild. All right, well, uh, we're gonna go. Uh, Lin, get your stuff. Yup, yup, yup. Great party. Seriously, I hope that, uh, Francis comes... is... gets better. Oh, no, you don't. What? What? Nobody's leaving. The k*ller is inside this room. No one leaves until I find him or her. Sorry I'm late. Whoa, who died? (doorbell rings) All: Trick or treat. Oh, you kids look great. Here ya go, one for you. Here ya are. Oh, Africa. Hey, is Bill puking in my bidet again? Full bars? Full bars? Full bars! She just gave us full-sized chocolate bars. Does she know? Oh, my God, was it an accident?! What just happened? How does this not topple your economy? Everything I knew to be true just went out the window. The Wagners are on vacation in St. Bart's. You know what, good for them. Those Wagners were looking run-down. Please, take one. What happens when you take two? Aah, it got me. Help! Oh, wait a minute. Nothing happens. I'll take three. Thanks, Wagner family. Have fun at church or whatever St. Bart's is. Ah, it's got my hand. Just kidding. It was funnier when Louise did it. Ma'am, I'm speaking now. I let you speak. Now let me speak. You don't tell me when to call 911. The police aren't coming. Looks like I have to do this investigation myself. Teddy, I really don't think anyone at your party purposely k*lled Francis. Every man is capable of m*rder if he's pushed far enough. Mm-hmm. Even you, Bob. You've been stewing in the corner all night. What are you talking about, Teddy? You can get a little testy, Bob. Don't buy him a V-neck T-shirt, whatever you do. He goes berserk. You're not in the clear either, Linda. You couldn't share the spotlight with Francis, could you? You had to stomp her out. Don't accuse me, Teddy. You're the spouse. It's always the spouse. Passion of m-m-murder passion. Teddy, you're going crazy. I mean, you're kind of ruining your own party. Or did Dennis ruin my party? By k*ll*ing Francis. I didn't k*ll your freaking rat. Maybe you didn't, Dennis. But I know you get dirty massages. Whoa. And let's not forget about Mike the Mailman. Me? What about me? It's your walk. Your menacing walk. Slamming your feet all over town. Left, right, k*ll, k*ll. It's a limp, Teddy. You know Mike has uneven legs. It's why I wear my special shoes. Don't you mean m*rder weapons? Yeah, you know what? I actually wanna see everyone's potential m*rder weapons. Yeah, shoes in the chip bowl, now. Aww, those were good chips. Yeah, they were, Linda! They were good chips! Milo: Okay, guys. It's getting pretty late. Better get off the streets, huh? We're pushing it a little. Uh, don't you think? Yeah. What do you mean? We're just getting started. There's a whole other street here full of sugar just waiting to course through our veins. (whispering): Hell Hunt. (whispering): What does that mean? Yeah, why did you just whisper "Hell Hunt?" You guys don't know about Hell Hunt? You're not from Kingshead Island, are you? We come from the mainland: America. Every Halloween, after all the parents get drunk, the teenagers come out and they go freaking crazy. They ride around town on their bikes, vandalize stuff, and if any little kids are still out, I heard they, uh... I heard they, uh... I heard they, uh... They, uh... Say it. I heard they shave your head. I heard they throw balloons full of pee. Three years ago my brother's friend stayed out too late and he came home covered in syrup without any eyebrows. Yeah, I don't know about all this. That's a lot of different stories. I like syrup. Look, it's not safe. We've got to get indoors. And you guys need to get to the dock. Cool tip, Milo. Come on, guys. Let's go get some more candy. Huh, what was that? Huh? What? Did you hear that? No. (teenagers laugh) Hell Hunt! Hide! Boy: Oh, kids, come out and play. (laughs) (howls) (laughing) Hey, Wade Boggs, do you like eggs? How do you like these eggs?! Ow! I don't like 'em! Please don't cry. Please don't cry. Ah, quick question. Does anyone here know how to get back to the ferry? (brakes squeaking) Oh, ah, hey, Amanda! Hey, Bryce. What's up? Oh, not much. Just, uh, hanging out with my... budsies. I remember when I was a sophomore. Hell Hunt's so lame. Yeah. I mean, it's like... (laughs) grow up, right? I guess it's cool you guys are keeping up the tradition, though. Oh, totally. Yeah, Hell Hunt's the best. So are you. (clears throat) What? Um, that's your car that you're driving? That's your car that you drive? This guy is dying out there. He just needs to be himself. Oh, no. He should pretend to be someone else. What the freak was that? What? I-I thought I heard something. I got 20-20 hearing. Anyway, you should cruise by my lacrosse game. No thanks! Bye! Bye. There's one! Geesh! Aah! Goosh! Ow! Let's go. Where are we? I think it's a country club. It's like a huge miniature golf course. The windmills are gonna be enormous. Look. I see a light. Maybe that's the docks! (bird squeaks)   (crickets chirping) Tennis courts? I don't think those kids are playing tennis. Or they're playing it very wrong. (squeaking) Ah, they all kind of fit. Like she got stomped a couple of times. Can I have my shoes back now? I'm the only one here with uneven legs. Quit milking that leg, Wobbles. Whoa, that's not funny, Teddy. It's okay. It's my last name. Fine, you can have your left one back! Thank you. Maybe we should ask Francis who k*lled her? Are you mocking me, Gretchen? No. I'm a medium, Teddy. I can talk to dead animals. Mort, your toupee says hi. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Good joke! She's pretending I wear a toupee. So funny. Okay, we're leaving now. Maybe I can still catch up with the kids. But Gretchen's onto something. (silly vocalizing) Lin, she's just drunk. Let's go before she asks us for a ride home. Bobby! Psst. Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! What? What is it? You have fur on the back of your costume, Bob. What? And tiny little scratch marks. Oh, God! Oh, God. I ki... (whispers): ...k*lled Francis. (groans) (squeaking) Psst! Milo?! I'm so glad you guys are here. They're gonna pee-balloon us any minute now. Oh, yeah, we're glad we're here, too. So, uhyeah, you know what? Oh, this just came to mind. How do you get to the ferry? Oh, ah, okay, just follow this road down the hill and turn right at the stop sign. Now help us break out of here! Lizard: There's kids loose! Let's get 'em! Run! (laughing) You're in trouble! Get it?! Louise: Yes! You can't outrun number one! Louise: Yes, we can! (panting) Three, please. Let's get off this godforsaken island and back to the armpit we call home. I can't wait to be back in my own house, in my own pajamas, in my own Dutch oven. So long, island! (screaming in distance) Oh, those kids are really getting it. I remember Hell Hunt. Still can't stand the sight of eggs. Won't eat 'em, won't touch 'em. What about a nice egg salad? No more egg talk! Yes, more egg talk! Man: Aah. Eggs! Let's go, Gene! Tina, come on! But Milo and Ned are back there, and they need us. (pained screaming) Do they, though? Tina, this isn't our fight! Do you really want to stay here and get pee-ballooned? Yeah. I can pee on myself. I don't need any handouts. Listen, this town gave us the best candy we've ever seen. We owe it to them to go back. Great. Now my candy tastes like guilt! Aah! Fine! We'll go back and save Milo and what's-his-face, but I get to slap Gene. That's fair. (yells) Aah! I banish you from the land of Latifah! Okay, so all we have to do is sneak up to the tennis courts, take out the guy guarding the gate, fight off four teenagers and free the kids. I zoned out. Say that again. We just need some kind of distraction. (tires squeak, phone ringing) I'll be right there. I'm just stopping to get gum and some t-pons. Distraction located. All right, who wants the first pee balloon? You? No. You? No. And... send. (phone beeping) (phone beeps on) Hell, yeah. I just got a text from Amanda. "Pool party at the Wagner house with me and the girls!" What? That's awesome! Ugh. It's kind of cold to go pool hopping. (phone beeping) "The Wagner's pool is not cold." That's weird. Okay, let's go! What about Hell Hunt? Are you crazy? These girls are seniors. I heard Amanda's got a belly button ring. Well, I heard she can tie a cherry stem with her butt! I heard she has to special order her bras! This thing is like a remote control. They'll do whatever I say. Tell them to push their butts together. Give them French accents. She says hurry. And that we're really cute when we hurry. Hey, get all your farts out now before we get there. (whirring) (crickets chirping) Help! Help! Let us out of here! (grunting) Help! Queen Latifah, give me strength! (groaning) (metallic creaking) Thanks, guys. Oh, oh, thank you. I'm not a big fan of pee, right, Ned? Well, we've got a boat to catch. Hold on. I'm not done with this yet. These teens messed with the wrong kids... us. (phone beeping) "Sorry we are late. "We are getting our boobs ready. "You boyz go skinny-dipping. C U soon to skinny-dip." All right, let's pop off our pants. There's a lot of carrots in that stew. (whoops) This is awesome! We're skinny-dipping! It's gonna be even better with girls, I bet! Okay, let's get to the ferry. This candy's not gonna eat itself. We should steal their clothes and throw them in the ocean. Or we could take pictures of them, and then later, we can look at them. That would show them! Fine, I'm gonna get started. Chocolate, caramel, lollipop, hot sauce. Yes! That's it! Let's put hot sauce in their underwear! Does that even do anything? Yeah, if there's one thing a wiener hates, it's hot sauce. I learned that the hard way. Mmm. Taco on the toilet. Why doesn't everybody do this? (screaming) 11 years old and still learning every day.  And that's amazing grace.  Who would like to pay tribute to Francis? Mike? Every time I delivered mail to Teddy, Francis greeted me with a friendly...  Wee, wee, wee-wee, wee, boop-doop-doop.  Something like that. What do I do? Teddy's gonna k*ll me for k*ll*ing Francis. You got to tell him. A guinea pig. What is it? Anyway, I'm Dennis. Thank you guys. That was beautiful. Bob, do you want to say anything? Yes. Uh, Francis was a great animal. She went through her life with such poise... I can't do this. Teddy, I k*lled Francis. What?! I-I didn't even know I did it! I couldn't feel her underneath this stupid fat suit that you made me wear! Oh. Oh. (squeaking) Oh! Oh, God. Damn it. (squeaking) You could have been summer Frankenstein. Summer Frankenstein wasn't good enough for you. I'm really sorry, Teddy. She gave me the best 14 years of my life. Wait. She was 14 years old? How long do they usually live? I don't know. Three to five years. Uh, she was a 154 in guinea pig years. Uh, you probably shouldn't have painted her black and orange, man. Yeah, she got real dizzy. She kept trying to eat her paw. Wait. Why would you spray-paint your guinea pig, Teddy? For the party, 'cause it went with everything. I know... Lin, I know that. But why, Teddy, would you do that? It's pretty stupid. I got caught up in the party. Okay, Bob. We both k*lled her. Fair enough. Well, now I can get a ferret. Anyway, thanks for coming, everybody. Sorry I called you all murderers. If anyone wants me to burn them a copy of this Spooky Sounds CD, just let me know. They're not coming. I'm getting pruney. Let's get out of here. Chill out with your dills out, man. Don't be lame. I'll call her. (phone ringing through) What the...? (phone ringing) Hey! Bye! (panting) I should have just taken one! Those full bars are weighing me down! (yells) No! Louise? How many pairs of underwear did you hot sauce? Only one of them... wore underwear! Huh. Huh. (yelling) Oh, you are dead! My baby! Come here! (grunting and groaning) Our pee! Ew! And so, the hell hunters become... the ones who are being hell-huntered. Well put. Thanks, guys. Mess 'em up! Bye, Milo. Bye, Milo's friend. We'll probably come back next Halloween. No, we won't! Yes! No! Ooh. Gross. Have you guys seen my phone? Geesh! Uh, actually some kid... Ow! I'm getting hit with... Ugh, forget it. Bye! Boy: Yes! Yes! Ooh, so close! Ugh! No fair. I lost all my full bars. You can lick my wrappers. Or I can eat your wrappers! Nothing will ever replace my baby, but these full bars are coming pretty close. There's my little cavities! Yeah, how was your first Halloween without me? Pretty boring, I bet. Uh... Um... Your father k*lled a guinea pig! He squashed it with... Lin! Oh, tell us about that! Was it in self-defense? Did he disrespect your woman? No. I just... rolled on to him. Yay! Yay! Oh, yeah! Here's what happened. Mm-hmm. It was a dark and spooky night. I knew it!
Gene, what are you doing? Tanning! It's the middle of summer and I look like a British lady. Hey, slow it down, George Hamilton. You want to look like an Oompa Loompa? Gene, if you want a tan, why don't you go out in the burger suit for a while and hand out samples? No way. I don't want burger lines. (door opens) MAN: Package for Bob Belcher. Dad, that's you! Thanks, Gene. A mystery package! What could it be? Huh, the return address is my dad's old restaurant. That's weird. There's a note. It's from those ladies who bought your dad's place. "Dear Bob, the workmen found this box when they were redoing the air vents. We were afraid it had vibrators in it. Boy, were we relieved." If you think about it, any box could have vibrators in it. Oh, my God, it's my toys! Wow, I haven't seen these since I was just a kid. I used to hide it from my dad because he didn't want me to have toys during work hours. Joke's on you, Dad. Someone filled your toy box with trash. What? No. This is my friend Brilly. A scouring pad? A scouring pal. And my World War II fighter plane. And my dog, Mr. Doglavich. That's soap. Yeah, but see? It's sort of shaped like a dog. Mm... What is this feeling I'm feeling right now? It's like I'm sad for another person? Is that a thing? Am I going crazy?! Look, times were different when I was growing up. We had to make our own fun. Here, try these. You'll see. Ow. See? Now I get it. If anything, this is too fun. I want to pet the dog! No, Mr. Doglavich! Sorry, Dad. He's dead. You could take him to the soap vet. No, I can't, Tina! We're going to bury him out back. Everybody get your coats. Bob, stop it now. No! It's summer! That's my dog! He's dead! Go take a time-out. I'm gonna write a eulogy. I knew you so briefly, you dead soap dog. Oh! I think I can fix him. There you go, good as new. Who's a good boy? Woof-woof! Fetch, Mr. Doglavich. Man: Get back to work, Bob. (mimics machine g*n) Die! Get back to work, Bob. (bicycle bell ringing) (kids laughing) (model plane trilling) (dog barking) Get back to work, Bobby. Oh, my God. Lin, I just realized something. I had a bad childhood. Yeah, I know. What do you mean you know? Look at you. What do you mean, look at me? Look at how you stand. People who had good childhoods don't stand like that. I thought I remembered having fun working at my dad's place, but I was just working... all the time. And snuggling with steel wool. And petting a piece of soap. (sighs) I guess talking about it helps. (snoring) (humming "Bridal Chorus") (both grunting) (groans) Kids, get back to work. (echoing): Get back to work... Oh, my God! Linda! Kids, your mother and I have an announcement. Buh, buh-buh-buh, buh-baa! You're having another baby? At your age?! Sick! I knew I spotted a bump. What?! No, I'm gassy. No, guys. Okay, here it goes. Kids... you're fired. Buh, buh-buh-ba! Ex-squeeze me? You're all fired. I deserve this. I've been coasting. This isn't punishment, it's, it's a gift. My dad made me work all the time. And that box of toys... Horrible toys. Yes, horrible toys, made me realize that I never had any fun. So, I want you to go out and have the summer and the childhood that I never had. So go out! Go outside! Go be children! But what are we supposed to do? Have a water balloon fight. Play in a vacant lot. Ride bikes. I'm more of an indoor boy. I can't defend myself, I've been declawed. Gene... All right, well, I guess we're gonna take off. Arrivedercis. Bye, Mom and Dad. Keep in touch. Don't change. See you in the fall. Tina, you can come home at night. Ah, phew. I'm glad you kids store your bikes in my garage. It's fun for me. Sometimes I pretend I have three kids of my own and these are their bikes. Which kid is your favorite? Jeremy. He needs me the most. The twins have each other. Whoa. Sometimes I come in here just so I can trip over 'em. I'll be, like, (growls) "The kids left their bikes here again." All right! Summer fun starts now! (grunts) Oh.  Fun, fun... fun-fun  Fun, fun... fun-fun  Fun-fun-fun, fun-fun-fun  Fun-fun-fun, fun-fun-fun, fun-fun-fun!  Ah! Diapers! So, how would you feel about, um... how do I say this?... uh, deferred payments? I wouldn't pay you now, but... eventually I would, in the future. What I'm gonna ask you isn't totally legal. It's not a s*x thing, though, so... Okay, I guess I'll keep these resumés on file. Maybe we can get an unpaid intern. Ooh, they could do coffee runs! Lin, we have coffee here. I don't care. No one's ever gotten me coffee! Everybody on the floor! This is a stickup! (both gasp) (laughs) Mickey! Ah, you're out of the slammer. Bob, Linda. bring it in. Aw... Hey... how's my favorite hostage? I thought you got eight years. You didn't escape, did you? It turned out the prosecutor was on meth for the entire trial! (gasps) And he drove his car into a peacock sanctuary. Now he's in jail and I'm out! Oh, good for you. I'll get you a beer A beer'd be nice. Hey, where are those whippersnappers of yours, huh? Uh, I fired them. What? No! That sounds harsh. We laid them off to go enjoy themselves. Ah, yeah, sure, breaking windows, lightin' fires, huffin' paint, Um... sniffin' glue, blowin' up houses, settin' rats in a bottle and throwin' 'em down a river and... No, none of those things. So, what's next for you, Mickey? What're you gonna do? Goin' straight, Bob! Gonna get a job. Find myself a gal. Or... I don't know what people do nowadays. Build a-a barn maybe. Um... Paint the barn with the gal. Put the gal in the barn and... Yeah, maybe. You know, American dream. Gal and a barn. Yeah. Hey, Bobby, psst. What psst? We can both hear you, Lin. What about ickey-May for the ob-jay? I'm pretty sure he can understand you, Lin. What language is that? Oh. Uh... wow. Well, Mickey, if you're serious about finding a job, we-we need someone for the summer. Oh. We can't pay you that much, honey. Not even what we're legally supposed to. I'd work for meals and a cot in the basement. Um... I guess you could sleep in the basement. (laughs) Oh, yay! Oh, I love it! We got the team back together again, huh? Oh! The three amagos. Olé! Ugh! Summer is awful. There's too much pressure to enjoy yourself. It's like New Year's Eve for kids. We should probably go by the restaurant. I bet that place is falling apart without us by now. Well, we've sown our wild oats. Things got crazy! Anyways, no need to grovel, Dad. We're back. We all said things we didn't mean. You said: "You're fired." You did not mean that. It sounded very insincere as I remember, and I thought, "No." (pots clattering) Oh, my God, is someone here? Um... Uh... Hey, baby Bobs! Kids, you remember Mickey. You fired us for a bank robber? Hey! Look, Mickey, we're back now, so you can turn in your apron. Louise, no. You guys are just our kids now, not our employees. Is that all we are to you, Dad? Your children?! Yes, and I want you to go have fun. Never! Stop fighting it and give it a chance! You can't make us leave. (all grunting) Hell no, I won't go! Hell no, I won't go! Uh! why are you guys stronger than me? Pilates! This is for your own good! Fine! We'll ride our bikes. Oh, yeah, we'll ride 'em so far you'll never see us again! Okay, bye, kids. Have fun. Bye, Mom. Guys, I think we're lost. I know. And all this breathing is making me hungry. Blueberry bushes! We're saved! Is this a farm? I thought those were extinct. We can't just eat these berries. They probably belong to someone. If you don't want people to eat your fruit, grow it inside a safe. I don't know how animals do it. Fruit is just bad, and they know it. Hello, children! (shrieks) Farmers! How did those get in there? Don't worry, we've got plenty of berries. Eat as many as you want. Or if you'd rather have sandwiches, we have plenty at the house. And lizards. I'll eat both. ...and then I woke up nude on horseback in the forest, and there she was, my Beverly. I had wandered away from a community birthing in a barn nearby. She looked like a faerie queene pooping under a tree.  A faerie queene pooping under a tree.  30 years and five kids later, and we're still doing it. Gene: Ew... Well, we've got an empty nest now, but we still have our farm. Our dad has a restaurant. We used to work there, but he fired us. Oh, now, that's a shame. We always let our kids work here. Beverly, I have a crazy idea.  They could work here...  Work here.  We couldn't afford to pay you much. Just, say, ten dollars a day. Ten dollars?! I could start saving for my Porsche Cayenne. But Dad doesn't want us to work. Dad doesn't have to know. Are we gonna send him a letter? You gonna call him up? No. You gonna find a phone and call Dad and tell him stuff? No. Seems like Dad told us to just make our way, didn't he? Well, I guess I don't want any gaps in my resumé. That's right. You don't. Good, because we've got a lot you could do. Yes, they could pick the weed... s. Great idea, Bev. We have a terrible weed problem. (both giggling) (chuckles) (chuckles) (chuckles) I don't get it! Morning, kids! Can I get you anything? I'll just have your coffee. Give it back. I'll just have a sip. Louise! No time, Louise. We're late. Late for what? Late to... for our... (clears throat) What would we be late for? It's not like we have jobs or anything. 'Cause we're late for the pier. Yeah, we gotta go to the pier. Yeah, the pier. To do our pier, our rock stuff. What's rock stuff? What do you mean...? Oh, droppin' rocks... Yeah. ...in the water. Sounds fun. Yeah. Yeah. I can disorient a fish. Nice. Well, as long as you kids are having fun. Oh, yeah. Ah. Summer rocks are the best rocks. Boy, we should go. Well, drop one for me. (chicken squawking) I want your nuggets! (Gene grunting) You two little critters will be our pickers. Now come with me. Gene has tons of experience picking his nose. And my butt. Tina, you'll be our blueberry delivery girl. Just remember, if you get jammed up, you don't know my name and you don't know where this farm is. I don't know where this farm is. Exactly. Mickey: Ta-da! Wow, Mickey, you handed out the whole tray of samples already? Sure did, Bob. And, ah, you don't mind the burger suit? I love it. I love it. I know who I am in this. I'm the burger. Right. Sorry, it's a little tight. But, yeah. It is. It's incredibly snug. It looks fine. It's good. I'm gonna need your help taking this off, I think. If that's all right? Oh, uh, yeah, sure. I'll, uh, try and pull the... No, you see, there's snaps in the crotch that my arms aren't long enough to get down to. If you could just... this and that. Yeah, I don't want to touch down there, so... Well, I need you to, 'cause that's what I can't reach. If you could root in there real quick and just pop 'em out. Um... ugh. Let me just, ah... get in there. Yeah, oh, okay, it's hairy, yup. Mickey: Ah, there you go. Thanks, man. Whoa, Mickey. You're not wearing any underwear. Do not wear underwear in prison. Someone could choke you with it. Well, why don't you leave the burger suit on then, huh? All right. Hey, Mickey's a pretty good worker, huh? Yeah. He's the helpful, enthusiastic employee we've never had. I wish he'd wear underwear though. Yeah, hold the pickle, ha-ha! And that's how you pick the weeds! Which ones are the weeds? They all are. Why are the weeds inside? So that they aren't outside, messing up the blueberries. Why don't you just set this whole greenhouse on fire? Be done with it. Oh, we're going to, one dime at a time. (hums) I'll sing you a work song.  Well, we work  And we work and we work all day  Work, work, work in America, work  And we workin' in the weeds and American work  And workin' in the weeds and a work, work, work  And worky-work-work, and come on, Gene.  Pick up the pace, come on, buddy, there we go.  Good day. Hello. Howdy. (doorbell rings) Hi, I have your blueberry delivery. Hey all right, new blueberry girl. How's this batch, pretty kind? Yeah, kind to your body. Because of antioxidants. Hello, Belcher child. Does your father know what you're doing? No, he thinks I'm having summer fun. Good. Let's keep it that way. Let's keep it that way. Ooh, blueberries. I'm ready for a bake-off. (groaning sound) Tina? Oh, it's just the refrigerator. Hey, fridge. You sure sounded like Tina a second ago. Wonder what she's doing right now. And I wonder what Gene's doing. Probably farting. (Mickey laughing)   (laughing) What's so funny? The burger of the day, Bob. I just noticed it. The "Beets Me Burger." (laughing) That's brilliant. It works on so many levels. Well, it's not that good. I mean... Louise would come up with a better one than that. Like, she would write, like, "Dia-beets-es Burger, comes with insulin." Oh... that's in poor taste, huh? Sure, but that's what makes it fun... That doesn't sound fun. It sounds hurtful. That's a really terrible disease. Well, I know it is... My grandmother had that disease. Well, I'm sorry. B.B. King has that disease. Shut up, Mickey. Sorry, but just hush. Ten dollars in my pocket, Gene got bitten by a lizard, we're living the dream, guys. I just wish Mom and Dad worked at the farm with us. Yeah, I miss making fun of Dad's B.O. I'm too scared to make fun of Cooper and Beverly's smell. I think there's something seriously wrong with them. Hey blueberry girl, do you have any extra blueberries on you? No. And don't ever come here again, you hear me? My parents don't know I deliver blueberries, get it? Okay, whatever. No. Do you get it? Don't... come... here... again. Okay, bye. That was a close one. People love fruit! I will never understand it. It's not that good. (calypso music playing) Bob. Hmm? Mickey's playing his calypso again. Can you say somethin'? You go. Come on, get up. All right. (music playing, Mickey singing)  Is that a parakeet in my hat?  No, no, no  That's not a parakeet in ya hat  Is that an alligator Mickey?  Want to eat the parakeet? Mickey?  The alligator say... Mickey?  No, I do not want the parakeet  Hello, Mickey?! Ha-ho-ho, hey, Bob! What's that? Oh, this? Oh, you've never seen this movie? It's great. It's a guy, he wants to be big. Then he gets big, he doesn't want to be big anymore, then he gets small, but the suit's too big. I'm talking about behind the poster, Mickey. Oh, um... Are you making a hole in my wall? No, no, no. I was fixing that. Fixing it with a pick? Yes. Mickey? All right, look, Bob. Don't tell anybody, but I'm digging my way to the bank. What? Come on, no. It's the perfect crime. I've got double jeopardy! What do you mean you have double jeopardy? I'm robbing the same bank, Bob. They can't try me for it again. Yes, they can, Mickey. Look, remember how you held me hostage? Of course I do, silly. That's how we met. And there were SWAT teams, and helicopters, and negotiators? Yeah, it was great, right? It wasn't great, Mickey. That's the only time in my whole life I ever want to have SWAT guys pointing g*ns at my face. Just that one time. Never again. Got it? So, are you cool with me finishing my tunnel? No. You may not tunnel through my basement to a bank. I forbid it! Fine, then, Bob, why don't you fire me? Okay, you're fired. You're firing me?! Look, you can stay tonight, but tomorrow you're gonna have to find another place. Okay. That's cool. I'm taking the pick. No! Oh, Bob. I tell you. Uh-huh. It's gonna be really tough to find a job within 50 feet of the bank that will also let me sleep in the basement. Hmm. Well, I'm sure there's something. Oh, I'm so clumsy. Better clean that up, Mickey. Actually, I fired Mickey. And good news, I'm hiring you all back full time, starting right now. So you can clean it up! Uh... sorry, Dad, but we can't do that. Look, I know what I said before about wanting you to have fun, but the thing is, my childhood was terrible because I actually had to work, and my dad never smiled or laughed. Yeah, mine neither. And he had a drinking problem. Oh, been there, man. Open up some fresh wounds here, Bob. All right, Mickey, enough. All right. (clears throat) I spent last night thinking about this, and I'm a pretty good dad. Yeah, Mom's the one with the drinking problem. The problem is I don't have a friggin' drink in my hand! (laughing) The point is, you guys don't have a hard life, you know? You just goof around. And you should be goofing around here at home, with us. Dad, we've moved on. We got other jobs. What?! We're working girls now! You're a girl? Yes. Nah. Yes. He's not. He's not. No. Tell that to my v*g1n*! You got other jobs? What do you mean, you got other jobs? What about the restaurant? Oh, that's adorable, Dad. You thought that you could snap your fancy dad fingers and we'd come crawling back. You thought if you didn't want us, nobody else would? Well, guess what, Cooper and Beverly wanted us! Who's Cooper and Beverly? Cooper and Beverly? They're farmers. And they smell great, so don't even bother asking. They still have farms? Where do they have farms? Way out in the country where a man can breathe the air. Sorry, Dad. I hope we can still be friends. Wait. Wait. What are they paying you? I'll match it. Ten dollars a day. Never mind. Have a good day. Bye, guys! Hey, is that blueberry delivery girl with the glasses here? You mean Tina? She's not here. Well, I need to return these blueberries. Can you tell her they were mostly stems and seeds? I want a replacement or my 40 bucks back. Okay, I'll let her know. Okay, bye. Bye. That was weird. Wow, 40 bucks? Those are expensive blueberries. They're probably organic. (sniffing) Oh, they smell like a music festival. (sniffs) Huh, you're right. Bob: Oh, my God, Lin. Are the kids working on a pot farm? (gasps): Ooh. Oh, yeah, the old false-bottom blueberry box. I remember these from when I was a kid. We have to go get the kids. But we have no idea where this pot farm is. I may have some idea of exactly where it is. Mickey: No, wait, go back, go back, go back, go back. Wow, this isn't what I pictured. It's nice. Hey, I've been there, buddy. Remember, they can't cage this. What are you doing on our property? We want our kids. What kids? There are no kids here. Tina: Hi, Dad. Oh, hey... Hello. Oh, you mean our kids. Your kids? Those are our kids! Come on, guys. Get in the car. Now. Let's go. Mom, Dad, we already explained this. We work here now. Okay? You're acting a little desperado. No, Louise, you no longer work here. Dad, small farms are the backbone of America. Willie Nelson would love this place! Yes, he would, Gene, but not for the reason you're thinking of. (helicopter whirring) Bob: Oh, no. No, no. No SWAT teams! No g*ns! Code red, Mother! Code red! B-Bob, what do I do? I've never been an innocent bystander before. Just get your hands up, Mickey. Eh, like that? What? No. Up. Like this? The... you're doing like kitty paws. Up. Up. Higher. Higher? Like that? No, all the way up. Like past my shoulders? Get down! Everybody down! Hey, I know that guy. Hi. Hi. Pedal, Daddy, pedal! Both: Right! Left! Right! Left!  Right, baby, left  Right, left  Right...  Federal agent: Stop! And, uh, oh, let's take a right. Let's keep it moving.  Right, and turning  And a little more right.  Stop, please. Oh, my God.  We got to get out of here before they catch us  Whoa! Now this is summer fun! Cooper: Oh, hey, how you doing, guys?  Let's head over this way.  I'm getting a little dizzy. Louise: And that's why I believe blueberries should be decriminalized. (sighs) Louise, sit down. (school bell ringing) Okay, that's recess. Uh, be cool out there. Don't Bogart the snacks. And if the po-po rolls up, your first call's to your lawyer, not your mom.
(ship's horn blows) Bob: Okay, kids, you know the plan. When the ship docks, Gene: bam, bullhorn! Abandon ship! For Bob's Burgers. Then, Tina, when people start coming ashore: pow, coupons! 50% off to all cruise ship passengers. Pow. Try "poo." That always gets attention. Oh, yeah, yeah. No. Poo. Use the bullhorn. No. Poo. (laughs) Never mind. Just don't say anything. Yeah, don't say anything. Where is everybody? Did you hand out the coupons? Yes. Oh, wait. No! What happened? We practiced! We choked, Dad! We planned on handing them out, but then it was noon, and then there was a bug that landed on the ground, and anyway, the day just got away from us. Oh, God... Rooty-toot-toot, someone's wearin' a white suit! I think that's the captain, Lin. White pants, take a chance. Permission to come aboard? Permission given! I'm Captain Flarty. Is this restaurant seaman friendly? You know, I've tried burgers from Maine to Mexico, but this is the best burger I've ever had, Bob. Um, thank you. Maybe you could encourage your passengers to try our burgers. I'll do you one better. Join me as a guest chef on our cruise to Puerto Rico. Really? Ooh... Your family will accompany you, of course. Ten days, all expenses paid. (cackling) Wow, that's, that's quite an offer... Uh... but we really can't afford to leave this place for that long. Kids: Come on! Hmph! Also, I'm, I'm supposed to get a meat delivery, and the pickle guy's coming, too, and... You're turning me down? Yeah. Sorry? Um... Well, then, would you at least do me the honor (coughs) of cooking just for tonight, Bob, at the captain's table while we're docked? Say yes, say yes, say yes! Um... sure. Uh, yes. Yay! Well, it's something. We'll take it. Outstanding! And meanwhile, your family will have, of course, free run of the ship, and I, I do mean free. Take this VIP card, bride of Bob. Ooh... Women and children first.  And VIPs!  Everyone, listen! This ship is...! (muffled yelling) Fancy? Was he gonna say fancy? Sexy? Pregnant? A grand old dame? Don't tell us! Let it be a surprise! (laughing) What's so funny? Oh, just, uh... funny fish I saw. If it's that one, it's hilarious. If it's that one, it's dead, which isn't funny. Welcome aboard the Windbreaker, Belchers! Uh, thank you, Captain. This is our first time on... Aah! Kiki likes you! Go on. Oh, don't be afraid, pet him, pet him. Uh, no, thanks. What is, what is... what is he? I want you to pet him. He's a capybara. Aren't you a capybara? It's the largest member of the rodent family... After Gene. Mm-hmm. (Kiki grunting) Oh, God. Oh, Kiki! That's a big BM, yes. All right, dinner's at six bells. My first mate here, Mr. Asch, will show you to the galley. And you'll show the captain's table how burgers are done. All right, Bobby, have fun cooking! Yeah. Come on, kids. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I want to see how far Kiki gets with Dad's leg. Yeah...! Bob, this is our head chef, Duval. (grunts) If you'll excuse me, duty calls. My replacement. I hope that you have a hairnet for your face and arms. I'm not replacing you. I'm just cooking one meal for one night for the captain's table. You remind me of me, back when I was the captain's special guest chef for just "one night," 56 voyages ago! (dramatic tone plays) Ah, there's the dinner rolls. Why does your timer sound like that? It's French! (dramatic tone plays) Okay, over there is the movie theater, and beyond that is the rock-climbing wall. A talking manatee?! I don't know what that is, but I got to see it! All right. Us girls are gonna go hit the spa. Pass. I'm gonna go write dirty words on sunbathers' backs in sunscreen. Yeah, I'd rather not spend all day in a... (moans) I can go to the spa. Look at you, making hamburgers with your fancy beef for the fancy captain's table, Mr. Squishy-Squashy. Mm-hmm. The regular passengers will be enjoying my fresh vegetable stew. Um, none of those vegetables are fresh. The passengers don't care. They only complain if we run out. And when they complain, the captain gets angry. Is he a little crazy? (hushed): Shh! He can hear you. He put a microphone in the cheese grater. Act normal. (humming) Come on. Hum, hum. Okay. Uh... (humming) That's it. Humming like normal. Okay. Announcer: He's a former regional Star Search finalist... she's the sexiest sea cow on the ocean. Together they're Herman and Marilyn! Why were you out so late last night, Marilyn? Listen to this one. Always up my butt.  Ooh-ooh-ooh, sexy lady, ocean lady.  This is so much safer than the sun. Come on, cook me. (bed buzzes) I can't work on minors. Ship's regulations. I could lose my job. Marco, what if I told you I'm holding a life-threatening amount of tension in my glutes? No glutes. Calves? No. Haunches? No. Muffin top? Back fat? No. Top of head only. Deal. (moans) Don't stop. (moans) Francesca, I don't want to be here, you don't want to be here. So let's make the best of it. Can you do this? Ooh! Cancel the rest of my appointments. Nailed it! Why don't you jump into the ocean and see me sometime? (all laugh) What's your name, handsome? No, it's Gene. Hi, Gene. Hygiene. Something this one could use a little more of. Well, at least my jokes are fresh. Jokes? What jokes? You're the straight man. I use the term loosely. Well, you know loose. I prefer to be called "flexible." My pants feel funny! Good-bye! I need a summer drink to go with my new summer glow! Hey, Isaac, daiquiri me! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah. Who wants apps? I'll take 'em all! Hi, Gene. My scalp massage was fantastic. Thanks for asking. How was the puppet show? Weird. I felt like I had to pee the whole time, but I didn't. Whoo, throw a ripped wedding dress on this daiquiri 'cause it is not a virgin! Go ahead and give yourself a big tip on goldie. And this is my son. You can't tell 'cause he's pale and I'm so dark, but take care of him, all right? Looks like the boy who's sweet on you has a silver spoon sticking out of his mouth. Mm-hmm. I think we just found our meal ticket. Duval, you're sweating into your stew. Eh, saves on salt. Oh, God. I'm glad I'm leaving after this meal. It's like a hundred degrees in here. Oh, sorry. I was hogging the fan. Okay. That doesn't work. Thanks. Cool off. Thank you. Cool off. Take it away. Here you are. Ouch. It's on my face. Ah-ah. Ah-ah. Ah-ah. Come on, lady. Let her play it. You've had plenty. (sniffs) Ugh! Oysters? Yes, they're for the brunch tomorrow. Duval, these oysters are spoiled. You're spoiled. Okay. I don't know why I thought you'd be interested in that, but, uh, don't serve those. I am serving them. Don't serve those. I'm serving them. Captain would like to thank the chef. Oh! I meant Bob. Oh. Huh? Hmm. Psst. Urgent whisper. Meet me later. Cabin 308. (coughs) Me? No, the other handsome young man I'm whispering to. I wish I could, but we're leaving after dessert. Well, if you're looking for something sweet... Who are you whispering to?! Him? Oh, leave him alone. You leave him alone. I think you've embarrassed yourself enough for one night! Remember, cabin 308! Honored guests, let's give a big Windbreaker salute to guest chef Bob Belcher! Linda: That's my man! He made your burgers and he made my babies! Ugh. Okay, kids, come on, time to go... Are we moving? Bob Belcher, everyone. Where's the land? Where's the land? Where's the land?! Next stop, Puerto Rico. What?! Looks like you'll be my private chef after all. No, you can't do... Linda, we're being shanghaied! Shanghaied? Ooh! Ancient Chinese vacation! Yay! Yahoo! Boobies! What? Nothing. (whimpers) All right, steady as she goes, Bob. I wouldn't call a ten-day, all-expense-paid cruise "being shanghaied." But you can't force my family to be on this crazy boat for ten days. Oh, come on, Bobby. It's a vacation. You deserve it. We all do. Stop fighting it. This isn't a vacation, Linda, it's a kidnapping. This is a slave ship. You're disoriented, Bob. It happens to some people when they're at sea. You'll adjust once you let yourself relax. Yeah, Bob. Give in. We're not missing anything at home. Hey, Bob, it's Demetri. I'm gonna leave your meat outside. Uh, you and Linda are probably upstairs. Back in five minutes, right, buddy? Ooh-ooh-ah-ah! (chuckles) All right. Let's discuss your concerns on the bridge, Bob, where there's s a ship-t-shore radio you're free to use. You can call someone and make arrangements. All right. All right, good man. (quietly): I'm gonna let him steer the boat. That always works. You'll get your vacation. Kids, looks like we're on this Puerto Rican cruise for the whole enchilada. So, now I can go to room 308. What's in room 308? I don't know! I wonder if Marco has a 9:00 scalp shiatsu. I'll massage your scalp, Tina. Ow, ow, ow. So, how does this work? The coast guard sends a boat for us or... Wait, this isn't the bridge. Mm-hmm. This is the galley. And your home for the next ten days. You're out of your mind. Yes... with hunger. Now get cooking, 'cause I've got room for another burger. And oh! Oh, it looks like Kiki does, too. (grunting) Let him finish! Yes, sir. (panting) Go ahead, Bob. Go ahead, run! Unless you can run on water, there's nowhere for you to go! Damn it, you're right! (laughs) Who's crazy now, Bob? You still are! Ah...! Bob. (over P.A.): Attention crew, this is your captain. Our mustachioed guest chef has gone missing. First one to find him gets their passport back. All right, let's see what these babies can do. (grunts) No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Francesca! Hey, Marco. I'm four hours older. Maybe you can rub my neck now? (whispering): Don't tire him out. Do you have penny slots? Yes, we do. Give me a whole roll of pennies 'cause I feel lucky. Marilyn (sing-songy): Who is it? (hushed): It's Gene. I can't talk long, he's in the shower. I got you this mug. I hope you "heart" cruising. Thank you. Uh! (shatters) Herman: Marilyn, who are you talking to? Uh, room service! He's jealous. He never lets me out of his sight. I just need 100 bucks for new headshots, then I can go solo. But where, oh, where will I get $100?! Well, maybe you... Oh, Gene, thank you! It'll just be a loan, I promise. Here's your first interest payment. Marilyn, you never wipe the seat! There's sea water everywhere! (gasps) Run, my little cabbage! Run to $100! (ship's horn blows in distance) Yes! Help! SOS! We've been kidnapped! Man (on bullhorn): Sorry, please repeat! (disco plays) We've been kidnapped! My family's on this boat! (music stops) Is everything okay or is there a problem? (disco plays) Th-The captain is crazy! Help us! (music stops) All I hear is a funky bass line. (disco plays) I know, because he's doing it! Stop turning the music on! Ha-ha! Very funny! Screw you! (music stops, plays)   What's the matter, Bob, you don't like high energy dance music?! k*ller whale, k*ller whale, k*ller whale! Orca! Whoo-ha-ha! Yeah! Uh, Bobby? Bobby? Have you kids seen your father? You mean that creepy guy with the mustache? Yeah. No. Hey, we're trying to sleep in here. Sorry. Penny angel! Feels good. Oh, feels good on my face! Pennies, pennies, pennies. Mom, we talked about this. Pennies, pennies, pennies. Mom, stop. Pennies, pennies, pennies. You're better than this. Pennies, pennies, pennies. Flarty (over P.A.): Come out, come out, wherever you are. (giggles) You made one mistake, Flarty: you let me live. Passengers, join us tomorrow morning for Poseidon's Brunch, featuring Chef Duval's famous Oysters Onassis. Kiki loves them, and you will, too. Oh, crap. The oysters. Row, row, row the boat... Duval? Hmm? Is that you in there? No one's in this pot. Go away. I am the spaghetti. Duval, you're not the spaghetti. I am spaghetti. Let go of the lid. Just spaghetti in here. Val, stop. I'm trying to get off the ship, all right? But first you have to throw out those oysters. If I don't serve the oysters, Flarty will make me teach pole-dancing to seniors. But if you serve them, people can get really sick. It's like the Hippocratic Oath of chefs, Duval, to not make people sick on purpose. Bob... Yes? ...kiss me. What? You know you want to. No, I don't. You didn't just want to kiss me just now? I didn't. All right. But you're right. Come, let's throw out those horrible oysters right now, Bob! Now you're talking. You first. Way in the back. What the hell?! Duval, open the door! You spend the night in there. The captain is complicated, but he knows what's best. (banging on door) Duval! Duval! I will kiss you. Too late. The moment's gone, Bob. Duval! We can do more than kiss! Other things! Duval! (banging) (Bob grunting) Thanks for serving canned meat, Duval. (grunting) Flarty (on P.A.): Good morning, Windbreakers! Looking forward to seeing you all at Poseidon's Brunch, featuring Oysters Onassis, as well as the catch of the day. (laughs) That one is a little shout-out for you-know-who. (horn blares) (squishing sound) Hmm? He's gone! Oh, damn it! You get the brunch ready! You! You find Bob! When he runs, it only makes me want him more, right, Kiki? Kiki-Kiki-Kiki. Little help! (air hissing) Oh, sorry. Bob: Louise, come here. Over here. Oh, hey, Dad. Flarty is absolutely insane. He locked me in his walk-in overnight. He's gonna serve rotten oysters. We've got to stop him. Oh, Dad, watch this. Clackety-clackety- clackety-clackety, click-click-click- click-clack. Huh? Louise, are you gonna help me or not? Okay, I'll help. All right, good. First, we need to distract Flarty and his crew while I take the oysters from the brunch. Well, I am a master of distraction. Ow! See? (panting) I'm gonna get you that hundred bucks, baby. (grunts) No! Those are for Marilyn! Ah! No! Drop it! We have personnel on every deck looking for Bob, sir. (yells) (gasps) Ha-ha! I got your rat! My Kiki! Clackety-clackety-clackety- clackety... Get her! Clackety-clackety-clackety- clackety... So long, seamen! Clackety-clackety... Where are you taking the oysters? Trust me, you don't want these. There's plenty of other things to eat. Don't tell me what to eat! Let go. I'm trying to help. Yeah, help yourself. Argh! They must be running out! Clackety-clackety-clackety- clackety... I did it! I did the distraction! Typically, Louise, when you do a distraction, you don't lead everybody to me, right? Right! Okay, next time. How dare you use Kiki in your sadistic game? My sadistic game? That's right, buster. You kidnapped us. Thank you again. I'm having a wonderful time, Captain. Linda, are you kidding?! Wha...? He shouldn't be captain. Anyone would be a better captain than you. Sounds to me what's happening here is a mutiny! Ooh, mutiny? This boat has so many activities! Go ahead, Bob. You want a mutiny? Proceed. Okay. Come on. All right. Let's go. I will. Go ahead. (clears throat) Here we go. Everybody... Here we go. All right, let me... Call a mutiny. I'm doing it! All right. But if you fail, I'm putting you in a dinghy with nothing but a compass and a biscuit. Okay, fine. So who's with me?! How about you, shorts-and-binoculars guy? You hate it here. Or you, prisoner guy. I saw you locked in that room, right? You've got to be on my side. Don't look away! Oh, Dad. Oh, you're bombing. Oh, forget it! Get the dinghy! Captain, there seems to be a problem with the buffet. (vomiting sounds) Oh, boy. Uh, yup. Ooh, I love this song. (jazz playing) Marilyn?! Marilyn...! Ugh! Marilyn, are you okay?! I found your eye, but I couldn't get the money. But I will. Kid, forget it. It's just a scam! What? Oh, God. Listen, you're a sweet kid, (gags) and you deserve better than an old, (gags) an old sea cow like me. But, but... Save your buts. Some things just aren't meant to be. Keep the eye. He's got a whole box of them somewhere. Ah... What the hell was that about? I know she was a puppet, but she put her hand right up my heart. Aw, sick! Don't worry, Gene. There's plenty of manatees in the sea. But there's not, really, because they're endangered. (humming) Mon dieu! Now can we go to some land? These people need a hospital. Give it up, Bob. Your mutiny failed. Duval, make Bob a doggie bag for his dinghy. No, Captain. I'm sorry. Did you say no? Yes, I did. I gave you the best cooking years of my life. And now on behalf of all cooks and all oysters, I demand that you give up your command. There you go, Duval! There you go, Bob! You're relieved of your position, cook. Asch, remove Bob and Duval from the dining room. Asch! Asch! Duval is right, sir. I'm with him. I've cleaned up enough of your messes! Escort the captain to his stateroom. All right, you're doing great. Kiss me! Not now. Not a good time. Then when?! French kiss that Frenchman. Well, you've won, Bob. But remember this... What'd he say? Nothing. He just burped. Ah... (a la Marilyn): I miss you, Gene. I really, really miss you. Anyone need a mole removed? Ah, peel my back. Look, Marilyn, it's a meat farm. It's beautiful. Ugh! You've got to be kidding me. I'm going to bed, I'm not dealing with this right now. Or maybe ever. Well, I've never felt more rested. Like a protein sunset. It's nice.
Faster, faster, you beast! This is as fast as it goes, Gene. It has a messed-up wheel. And a lot of junk in the trunk. More to push. Yes, Gene. You love it. Beep-beep! Here we are in Turkey Town. Oh, hello there. Which one of you lucky fellas wants to get eaten by me this Thursday? (in goofy voices): Me! No, me! Okay, settle down everyone. So Dad's talking to turkeys now? Sheesh, Dad. Get an oven. Your dad loves Thanksgiving. It's his favorite holiday. Will it be you? You're a big one. You been working out? (in goofy voice): A little. Well, you look great. Yeah, it's a little weird, but it's his selection process. It's like The Bachelor, but at the end, the one he chooses gets eaten. That's what happens on the real Bachelor, too. They just don't show it on camera. (in goofy voice): Hey Bob, what about me? Oh, yeah. Sorry, I didn't see you there. I hope he waits to get it home before he stuffs it. Yes... Yes, it's you. (gasps, in goofy voice): Really? Really. (in goofy voice): Hey, thank you so much. I don't know what to say. It's okay, don't say anything. (in goofy voice): Oh, Bob. Dad, are you crying? Shh! Let them have their moment. Yes! Come on. Let's go get stuffing. Come on. You're the one! Come on! You are the one! Gene: That turkey is our mom now. (door bells jangling) Uh, Mr. Fischoeder. Um, it's not December yet. And I, I paid November's rent a few days ago. I know I used a lot of pennies, but... Stand down, Bob. I'm just here as a friend. A friend who needs to borrow your family for Thanksgiving. What? I need to borrow your family for Thanksgiving dinner. Why? Bob, have you ever been in love? I-I guess. I-I technically am. Hi! Well, Bob, I was in love once, too. Oh, sick! With Shelby Schnabel, the most famous sharpsh**ter since Annie Oakley. You lost me at "love" but brought me back with "sharpsh**ter." She left me for a married oil magnate. Then she left him for a married movie magnate. She's a magnate magnet. More like a homewrecker. Exactly, which is why I need to give her a home to wreck. If you want to wreck your home, buy a bunch of mice, like a normal person. So, Bob, in exchange for one month's rent, can your family pretend to be my family? Yay! Acting! Mmm... no. From now on, call me Gene Fischoeder. No wait, Vesuvio Fischoeder. No, wait, Alabama Slammer! I'll need you, too, Bob, to pose as my cook and to roast the bird. Definitely not. Thanksgiving is this family's favorite holiday. Eh. Wait, it's not? No way. Check the rankings. It goes: my birthday, Christmas, Halloween... Easter... Hanukkah... Snow Day, Amateur Night... Uh, okay, that's... Veterans Day... Tooth Fairy Eve... Not real. Patrick's Day, May Day, Groundhog Day, season premiere of Game of Thrones... You've never even seen... Opposite Day, Day of the Dead... Stop. Dawn of the Dead, Carnivale... Angela Lansbury's birthday... No. Bath Night... (Bob groans) Black Friday, then Thanksgiving. Love Black Friday. Black Friday before Thanksgiving? Yeah, 'cause it's dark. Oh, come on guys, what about all of our Thanksgiving traditions? Gene and I always play football. Always go for the feet. Ow! Tina and I break the wishbone. I wished for more wishbones. And Louise, we use the giblets to play Turkey Crime Scene Investigation: Miami. (shutter clicks) Cause of d*ath is a missing head. Same as last year. Same as every year. We've got a serial k*ller on our hands! But everyone's favorite part is my funny toast, right? Like, last year, I said, if you want to open the door to this family, use the tur-key! (chuckling): Tur... Oh, my gosh. I just got it. Let's up the ante. Three months rent. (gasps) Bobby. Two. Gene, no. Purple. What are we guessing? Five. Deal. Wow, I didn't think you were gonna go... Okay. Uh... well, that'll make a huge difference for us. That's-that's like real money. Goodie. I'll send you all scripts for Thursday. I want you to really get into your parts. Just like I'm going to get into Shelby's parts. Her lady parts. Which are the lady parts? The v*g1n* and the heart. (grunts) I can't believe my bridesmaid's dress from Ginger's wedding still fits me. You look like an elegant sausage. I hope I can breathe to do my Thanksgiving song. I thought we settled on no song. I hate plays that don't have songs. I'll find a place to fit it in. What's your Thanksgiving song? Uh, no, no, no, no, no.  Pass the cranberry sauce  We're having mashed potatoes  Ooh, the turkey looks great Lin...  Thank you for loving me Lin.  Thank you for being there  Oh, God.  Everyone's thankin' Lin.  The whole world's thankin' you  Stop, Lin. Stop.  Thankin' us for thankin' you Lin.  k*ll the turkey.  Please. I liked it. Thank you. Okay, everyone, we're here. Listen, I figured out how to have our own Thanksgiving, stuffed inside Fischoeder's Thanksgiving. Like a turducken. A poultry within a poultry. It's like Inception, with meats. Gene, before dinner, you come in and we'll play tackle in the kitchen. Then send Tina in for the wishbone. And then Louise. And at exactly 8:00, you all say you have to go to the bathroom and then you come to the kitchen for my toast. 8:00... that's your cue. I'm only half listening. Did you just say you want us to go to the bathroom in the kitchen? No, Louise. Come on, guys, "Belcher Thanksgiving" on three, ready? One, two... Ah, the Fischoeders! Come inside, family. Yay. Okay, uh... You guys go. (door slams) I'm still excited. Uh, can-can you open the door? Fischoeder: Go around the back, cook. Okay. Still gonna be good. This house was originally built by a paranoid arsenic manufacturer. Oh, I bet there are actual skeletons in these closets. And a dungeon full of Dungeness crabs. I bet when you flush the toilets, the water evaporates upwards and forms a rainbow. Two of you are correct. You already signed your liability waivers, so go explore. Awesome! (toilet flushes) So, Mr. Fisch... Tina: I was right about the toilets. Huh, I thought the kitchen would be more, uh, mansion-y. Mansions are for the owners, Bob, not the cooks. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going get drunk for dinner. Do you mean dressed? Dressed out of my mind. Got to loosen up, you know? Right, right. Got to get my s*x face on. I can't wait to see it. Well, Lin, this might not be so bad, right? This Thanksgiving. Neh. What? My hair! Now I got to go redo it. Great. Fine. Guess I'll just be here, alone. With uh... with the turkey. (in goofy voice): My name's Lance. Sorry. With Lance. How are you, Lance? (goofy voice): Pretty great. Oh, there are my little Fischies. Thanks for the new outfits. Sometimes you need a make-under. I'm glad you like them. Now, our job tonight is to fool the woman of my dreams into believing that we are a loving, happy nuclear family that she can destroy. Romantic. In order to keep you kids motivated, we're going to be playing by arcade rules. You'll be awarded these tickets for convincing performances as Fischoeder children. Game on. Wait, time out. Okay, game on again. I thought my shoe was untied. The one with the most tickets at the end of the evening can claim a gift from my prize room. The only prize I need is your love, father. And we're off and running. (growls) And just like every happy family, we now have a commissioned painng otius, holding the family crest covered in ten schlongs, which of course is German for "snakes." Oh-ho-ho. Look at the schlongs. (doorbell rings) Oh, she's here! She's here! Oh, God. Ooh, I'm so nervous. Places, people! Places! Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh. You ready for the oven? (in goofy voice): I dunno, Bob. It feels weird. We should be doing this at home. I know it's not the same, but it can still be fun. (goofy voice): Why don't you take a sip of that over there, Bob? That? (goofy voice): Yeah, that green bottle. It's, uh, absinthe. Doesn't this make you hallucinate? (goofy voice): Carpe diem! What? (goofy voice): Seize the day. All right, I'll take a little sip. This can't be that bad. Whoa. Weird. (goofy voice): Bob! Bob! Bob! What? (goofy voice): Can you leave the oven light on for me? I get scared. (chuckles) So cute. Here's the light. (goofy voice): It's too bright. Shelby, may I present my wife, Linda. Pleasure to meet you, Linda. Oh, I like that name, Linda. (loudly): And I'm Linda. Moving right along, these are my children, Gina, Team, and Lucy. Welcome to our happy home. Any ex-lover of my father's is a friend of mine. What unusual children. Calvin, your sperm did wonderfully. She took my sperm and ran with it. Because I'm his... (clearing throat) Because I... (clears throat) Because I'm his wife. Thank you, Linda. Say, do you kids like bullets? I think all kids like bullets. Think fast! Whoa! Whoa. Wow! Calvin, you kept my old r1fle. You weren't carrying a torch for me all these years, were you? Oh, of course not, I was just holding it for you. You can have it back. You don't mind if I cock this thing in here, do you? Cock away. (everyone shouting) Linda: Ow! Loud! That trick's called the "Reverse Cowgirl." I bet you could pierce Gene's ear from there. Ooh, do my belly button! Not till you're 18. If you teach me to sh**t, I'll teach you to regret teaching me to sh**t. And I can teach you to make burgers, like in our restau... Eh, eh! What is she talking about? All this talk about sh**ting is making me thirsty. Why don't we pull the trigger on a glass of wine? Ha-ha. I'm funny. I'm his funny wife. Being a family man suits you, Calvin. Hmm. You look better than I remember. When will Thanksgiving be over? I want it to be Father's Day every day! Very nice. Here, Father, let me refill your glass. You must be dehydrated from being so wonderful. Take it down a notch or two. Hey, Dad, remember when we did that thing that was fun and memorable? (whispering): That's pathetic. Um, hello, I'm your chef. Yes, this is our chef, uh, Burt. Here are your salads, and now I will, uh, go tackle the turkey. Did you hear that, Gene? I'm gonna go tackle the turkey. Tackle away. Tackle the turkey. Ah! Ow. (laughter) Oh! That was a great sh*t. Really, really funny. Do another one. Ooh! Do a crouton. Uh, no, I'm gonna go back to the kitchen now. So, uh, here I go. Back to the kitchen. Gene, go apologize to the cook. (groans) Gene! Buddy, football time. Let the traditions begin. (sighs) Let's make this quick. All right, I got the ball on the one yard line and then I gotta punch it in: Hut, one! Hut, two! Hut, hut, hut, hike! Ow. Great game, Dad, hit the showers. But we barely played. Gotta get out there and get more tickets. Tickets? What are you talking about? I don't have time to explain this to the help. Fine, just send Tina in. And come back for my toast! You got it, Buddy. One for me... and one for Bob. I'm very good at drinking this. Thank you. There's my girl! Okay, time to break the wishbone, right? Oh, crap, it's still in the turkey. Well, maybe we can just pull it out a little early. Ow! Oh, my God, that's hot! Got some skin! Okay, you grab your end and let's do the wish-skin. Um, okay. Great, you won! Yay. What'd you wish for, more wish-skins? More tickets. I'm way behind in the best kid contest. Oh. So you're gonna leave? I'll send Louise in. Louise Belcher regrets to inform you she cannot attend the Turkey CSI: Miami due to a prior comtmenmi Oh, great, I guess I did all this for nothing. Ugh! (goofy voice): Remember, Bob, it's all an act. Thanks, Lance, you've been my rock through all this. I love you. Well, it's almost 8:00, so I'll do my toast, and the Belcher Thanksgiving will be back on track. I "yam" what I "yam." And what I "yam" is the luckiest man in the world. All: Yeah! Was that a great toast or what? You're the toastest with the mostest. Mwah! Kids: Aw... Family! Thanksgiving...! Lance, you're big. Mm-hmm! (gasps) (Bob laughing) (chuckles)   (laughing continues) (gasps) Oh! (Bob yelling excitedly) (Bob blowing notes on bottle) This is weird, right? (timer dings) Oh, my God! (goofy voice): What? What's going on? It's 8:35! My toast! (all laughing) Oh, Fischoeder Dad, you are hilarious! (goofy voice): They're not coming, Bob. Yeah, I know, Lance. Ow! My face! Bobby, I need a chopped onion... stat! No one came in for my toast, Lin. My big toast. You can do your toast for us tomorrow. Tomorrow's not Thanksgiving. But tomorrow we'll have five months free rent. Because this is working... I think. Now come on, I need an onion so I can cry for my next scene. Chop-chop! (laughs) Get it? Fine. You don't want to come in here for my toast, I'll bring it out there. No, you will not, mister. I haven't even done my song yet. I'm coming out, Lin. Bob, you are drunk. (splutters) You're drunk. I am not. I've only had half of four bottles of wine. Just bring the turkey out and you can come back in here and take a nap on the floor like you do at home, okay? Now, let's go! (grunting, sighing) Thank you. Linda: All right! Thank you. That was called "Ode To Dad." Fischoeder: Bravo! And this is called "Better Ode To Dad." Get ready! (rhythmic grunting) I can't compete with that. You know, I am so emotional. What a wonderful... family we have. And it's... Hmm. It almost, it brings tears to my eyes. Hmm. Just a second... Gene (hushed): You're doing great mom. Really natural. (sobbing) Oh, you are so married. So gosh damn married! Hello, it's me, the cook, Bob... Or Burt. And this is Lance. Lance is a turkey. Lance, these are the jerks I mentioned in the kitchen, when I was talking to you. He seems like he's in a good place. So, without further ado, I will now give the traditional cook's toast that I do every year. Uh, maybe you should go back into the kitchen, Mr. Cook. Oh, shut up, Mrs. Fischoeder! Uh, ah, okay. Wow, there must be five months of dishes to do in there. You don't want to sleep in the basement again, Mr. Cook. Are you still talking?! You don't want to sleep without... Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah! Oh, dear! It's Thanksgiving again, and there's some "stuff-ing" I'm thankful for. (chuckles)  Go on and pass the cranberries...  Don't, Lin, don't!  It's time to sing a little song now.  Stop it! Stop! Wow, this is getting good. All right... (clears throat) Thanksgiving. (both grunting) Let's break the word down. Let me, uh, just... Thanks. Shh. Excuse me. Sorry. I've heard people use that word quite often. Up here. Let me just "pumpkin" you up by saying... Or "than" than. "pumpkin you up," right? Like "we have more than" day! Let's raise our glasses. Yes, raise your glasses. Tina, raise drop those glasses. Both: Raise them higher than that.  Oh, pass the cranberry!  All right. Shut up, Lin!  Let's get a little lazy  Fischoeder: Here's my toast, and what I say goes. Me? We'll go by applause. Everyone who liked the cook's toast best... Shh! Clap now! I don't need clapping. What I need is what every dad needs, hugging! Uh, kids, go hug your dad. Come on. No, your dad, your Fischoeder dad. Unbelievable. Wife, come! Oh, yes! Ah-ha, ha-ha. It's working. Let's seal the deal. No, no. Give me those lips. No... no... Lips. Lips. No, no. Lips. Lips. Okay, one. (screams) Whoa. Sick! Aw... Get your lips off her! Wow! Everybody wants everybody! This is so exciting. I believe the cook has had too much to drink. Oh, do you believe it?! I believe it in my heart of hearts. Oh, great, everyone wants to hear your beliefs! Back to the kitchen now! I'm not going back. Now this is a holiday. Is it cool if I grab a leg? No. You people don't deserve to eat Lance. Lance is my friend, okay? Ow, Lance, you're burning my arm. Put that turkey down. I pay your salary and your rent. Keep your blood money, Fischoeder! Bobby, come back! Not the gravy! Save me some dark meat! Lance, take care of my father! Get back here with that turkey! I'll get it back. I love a turkey hunt. Wait. What? They'll never catch us! Let's hide here. There he is! Oh, boy. (goofy voice): Duck, Bob, duck! You're a turkey, Lance. (goofy voice): Good one, Bob. They're gaining on us! (goofy voice): Run side to side! Okay, but I think this is slower. Shelby, stop! Don't sh**t him! What the...? Come back here with our turkey, cook! Never! He's mine! No, don't sh**t my dad! I'm not. I'm gonna sh**t the cook! And I won't k*ll him. I'm just gonna maim him! Gene: Tackle! (grunts) (thud) Oh, God, we k*lled Bobby! We k*lled Bobby! Dad! Why do they keep calling the cook "Dad"? Lin, he's sh*t. Oh, thank goodness. Oh, my God. Dad! Dad! Lance, talk to me. You're gonna be okay. (goofy voice): No, no I'm not gonna make it, Bob. Don't say that, Lance. Don't talk like that! You're gonna be fine! (goofy voice): No, I'm cold. I'm so cold. Get him a blanket! Get him a blanket! (mutters in goofy voice) What? What's he sayin'? I don't know. I can't understand. What's he sayin'?! He's just murmuring! Lance? Lance? Oh, he's gone!! Oh, Bobby, I'm so sorry about all this. I never want to be someone else's wife, even for pretend. Sorry we ruined your Thanksgiving, Dad. We were jerks. I'm sorry, too. I promise to tackle you every day for the rest of my life. I've been talking to a turkey for a long time now. But I drank a lot of absinthe, just to be fair. Oh, Bobby, come here. Mwah! Lin, not now, I'm grieving. I lost a friend today. This is so confusing! Well, it's clear to me that this cook has, uh, fathered these, uh, children with, uh, this... Oh, give it up. I'm not Fischoeder's wife, all right? He hired us to pretend to be his family so you'd be attracted to him... there. I'm touched that you would go to so much trouble for little old me. Oh, you're not old, and you're not little. Not where it counts. In the wabba-wabba. Oh, Calvin, this isn't gonna work. Oh. I respect myself too much not to be the other woman. Wow, you guys are insane. Let's get out of here. We can still have dinner at home. Wait! I almost forgot! I have the most tickets! And I know exactly what I want. Now this portrait will grow old for me and I'll stay nine forever. Oh! This "absence" is delicious. It's absinthe, Lin. You're absinthe. (laughs) Hey, Mom, are you hallucinating yet? Not yet. I need more. Okay, who wants what? I'll take a bullet piece, please. Me, too! I'll have a thigh. There's plenty of shrapnel for everyone... don't be shy. Good thing the bullet hit Lance, or else we'd be eating Dad. He'd taste old and bitter. I bet Dad would've made a great dinner. Thanks, Tina. Yeah, you're so plump. Oh. Aw, to delicious Bobby! Lin, don't toast to eating me. All (chanting): Eat Dad! Eat Dad! Eat Dad! Eat Bob! Eat Bob! Stop it. (chanting continues) Thanksgiving's over!  Pass the cranberry sauce  Bob: No...  We're having mashed potatoes  Ooh, the turkey looks great  Thank you for loving me Lin...  Thank you for being there  Please.  Thank you for loving me  Oh, God.  Everyone's thanking Lin...  The whole world's thanking you  Lin, stop. Lin, stop.  Thanking us for thanking you  Lin...  k*ll the turkey Lin!  No.  Pass the cranberry sauce   We're having mashed potatoes  Ooh, the turkey looks great  Thank you for loving me Lin...  Thank you for being there  Please.  Thank you for loving me  Everyone's thanking Lin...  The whole world's thanking you  Stop.  Thanking us for thanking you  k*ll the turkey.
Shh. So, Mort, you ordered a small? How small was it? What? Sorry, I'm taking a stand-up comedy class. I think I did something wrong. I thought it was funny. Ugh, the ice cream machine's stuck again. Hey, Mort, you're getting a free medium-- a free large-- a free extra large. Oh. You got to hit it just right, Dad. I said just right! Okay, kids, only one thing to do: ice cream for brunch. Teddy: Yay! Yeah, all right! Yay, free ice cream! Yeah. Let's just unplug it. Reach behind there and grab the plug. I found my retainer. Linda: You don't wear a retainer. Oh, God, you're right! Get it out of my mouth! Never mind, I got it. Aw. (door opens, bell jingles) Hi, Hugo, hope you're not here for ice cream. I'm lactose intolerant, Linda. Oh. I'm also intolerant of that suspicious-looking bicycle outside, Bob. Uh, why are you telling me? Maybe it's because you're the block captain. But you don't even live on this block. Well, I live in the quadrant and I happen to be the quadrant captain. Quadrant captain-- did you make that up? Did I make up these quadrant captain business cards? Why would you do that? I didn't actually mean to. Well, pick them up. No, now stand down. That bike has been there for 24 hours and the seat's missing. It's clearly abandoned. Fine, I'll take care of it. Don't be block-cocky, Bob, just do it. Jerk. Gene: Nailed him. You trying to steal my bike? No, someone thought it was, um. It's mine. Want to see the receipt? (farts) That's not a receipt. Where do you shop? I really thought being block captain would be more fun, like I'd have a g*n or a Taser or something. All I get is this whistle. Don't knock the whistle. Whistles stop hundreds of crimes every year. And thousands of basketball plays. And they make dolphins jump out of the water and eat fish. Dad, you could do that. Bob, I recall you raise either chinchillas or children. Which is it? Uh, children. Good. I'm focus-testing some ideas. I need a new blockbuster attraction at Wonder Wharf. Why don't you focus-test with the kids down at Wonder Wharf? Those sheep? I've already got their money. Besides, these children are a perfect cross-section of American youth. Yeah-- boy, girl, and Tina. I'm a tastemaker. When I talk, people listen. Guys? Mr. Fischoeder, we're adrenaline junkies. Oh. We like our rides pure, uncut, and assembled in "Méjico." I want something coming out of here, here, and/or here. The three-hole standard of excellence. Wait, walk me through the holes again. Let me throw some concepts at you. A bounce house full of jelly. Jam Slam! Try chutney. Keep pitching, Barnum. Scare-ousel-- a carousel where you ride on real horse skeletons. You had me at "horse" but lost me at "horse skeletons." You know, if you're looking for an attraction, this town actually has some interesting movie history. Hog Wash! Not you, Bob, it's an idea. Slide with the hogs. That's not bad. Yeah, well, seriously, in the '80s, they sh*t one of those shark movies right here in town-- The Deepening 3. Oh, yeah, in 3-D. Right, The Deepening 3D-eeepening. Oh, that shark made me so scared of the water, I spent the whole summer standing up to pee. (chuckles) Then I got into the habit. I like it. There's your attraction. Teddy, you remember The Deepening, right? Remember it? I was in it. Some of us locals worked on that movie. I was Handsome Lifeguard #3. Really? Seriously? Yeah, what? It's just, uh, you know, we're looking at the "after." It's kind of hard to picture the "before." Bob. Louise: Guys, the shark is for sale. What?! The shark? A prop house is selling the actual mechanical shark and they're ready to deal. The actual shark? Oh, wow, Mr. Fischoeder, you've got to get that shark. Teddy: Nah, don't, no, come on. Teddy, yes. You worked on the movie, you should be excited about this. Yeah, but just not that shark. Why, Teddy? I don't want to talk about it. Okay, that's one vote for yes and one cryptic vote for no. Let's run it past the focus group. Five-holer-- nostrils, too. Sounds like a winner. Noooo! Teddy, what is wrong with you? Uh, this ketchup is empty. Can I get a new ketchup, please? Mort: Some actor, this shark, a real ham. He chewed more scenery than Nicolas Cage. He really chewed it... with his shark teeth. (mic feedback screeches) Ha-ha-ha! (forced laughter) Ha, ha, ha! Louise, stop. Mort the mortician, everybody. Hey, I see Bob Belcher. All this was his idea. I know what you're thinking. That guy? Yes, the guy with the, uh, food place. Thank you. It's a restaurant. It's called Bob's... Now... please welcome champion water skier and shark attack survivor Kristi Sanducci. I'd like to thank the jackass who got the left-handed scissors. Kristi Sanducci. Always professional. Now, the real star of The Deepening 3D-eeepening-- the... shark. Bob: Whoo-hoo, shark, yeah! Linda: Ugh, someone has not aged well. What a butterface. We've filled her up with diesel, now let's see what she can do. (mechanical clicking) Tina: It's waving at us. Hi. So that one does that. Let's see what this one does. (yells) Yes! Thank you, God. Woop, wrong one... (stammering)... oh, here we... Oh, boy. Yes, yes, all part of the fun. Can someone pass my arm back up here? Give me that, Louise-- we've got to give it back. No way! I caught it! It's like the bouquet at a wedding. I'm going to get bit next! You having fun? I wasn't-- I... (grunts) Ow. Wow, she's good with that thing. She can do that and park anywhere she wants. (sighs) And so it begins. Why are we watching a movie about a fake shark when we could be at Wonder Wharf standing next to the real fake shark? Because this is how I want to remember the shark-- in its prime, scaring the crap out of Linda Blair. Fischoeder is crazy to keep that thing going. After what happened to that girl's arm and that lady's poor dog and that guy's balls-- you know, the juggler. Oh, yeah, Fischoeder's crazy to keep it going with all those people lining up, paying to see it, buying souvenirs. Nothing good can come from that shark. It's evil. Oh, there I am again. That's me in the red, white, and blue trunks. What's everybody looking at? Nothing. Nothing. Your body. Oh, my God, Linda Blair's boobs just popped out of her wet suit. Ooh! They're comin' at ya! Huh, this movie's a little bluer than I remember. Let's get to a good part. (funky soundtrack playing) Outdoor shower scene-- no. Yes. Topless car wash. Yes. Tina, no. Nude hot tub-- no. Yes. Oh, okay, here's some good clean shark. No. See that surfer getting eaten? I made out with her. She had her movie makeup on. Fake organs were coming out of her side. Pretty weird. The '80s-- am I right? You are not wrong. Why is the shark attacking that submarine? The CIA is training sharks to attack Soviet subs, and they're holding the shark's baby hostage in the nude hot tub. So the shark isn't bad; she's just protecting her baby. She's misunderstood. She just needs a friend. (soulful '80s-era pop ballad melody playing) (deep belching) It doesn't want to be here. This is exploitation. I'll show you exploitation. Go up there and get me that fin. You want her fin? I've got a guy. He wants it packed in ice and on the next plane. Why does he want a mechanical shark fin? Mechanical shark fin soup. Mmm, that does sound good. Don't cut off her fin. It's her best feature. God, Tina, it'll grow back. Oh, yeah, cut it off. I'm bare-backing a shark. Come on, Gene, chop-chop with the chop-chop. Whoa, it's tippy! Aah, no, Gene, get the fin! (screams) (Gene grunting) Are we safe here? Of course! It's safety tape. They can't just call it that if it's... Aah! Aah! Run, shark, run. We set it free. No, we didn't, we were never here. But we were. Remember right now? Yeah, okay, but you know what I just remembered? We were never here. Oh, okay. (funky soundtrack playing) Man, this movie is, like, 90% nude car wash. Bob, there's some kind of commotion down at the Wonder Wharf. It's like the Running of the Bulls but dumber. Yeah, but with a shark. Uh, yeah, it is a shark. Yeah, it's a shark. Fischoeder: Nothing to worry about. Having a little shark problem. Uh, good time to grab a hot dog or some popcorn. Oh, or a hot dog. Mr. Fischoeder, enough's enough, right? You've got to shut off the shark, right? I mean, now. Shut it off? Oh, no, no, I've got a packed park. I can't shut down my top attraction. I mean, I really can't. That thing's on till it runs out of gas. But what if it breaks out of Wonder Wharf? What happens then? Those are reinforced cement walls, Bob, built by somebody-- proud immigrants, I guess, I don't... Wha...? The shark fell over? That's crazy. We were at the library, right, guys? Yeah, exploring the wonderful world of books and periodicals. Uh, yeah. And microfiche. Oh, no, no, no, no... (tires screeching) Crap. Oh, my God! The shark's busted onto Ocean Avenue. This is my fault. I have to do something. What? I said, "This is my fault. I have to do something." Oh. Block Captain Bob. Yeah. (blowing weakly) God. On Ocean Avenue, local merchants fear they will become so much fish food, while police and fire officials are caught in a surf-and-turf battle. Meanwhile, local citizens are taking matters into their own hands. The block captain has called an emergency, all-block, shark-stopping meeting... (crashing) Edith: That shark is ruining my arts and crafts business! This town might do all right without arts, but crafts?! Where the hell are we gonna be without crafts?! Screw crafts! What about my liquor store? Let me talk! Everybody, listen! Calm down! You calm down! I lost a son! Seriously? A sun quilt. It was beautiful. Listen, we're gonna solve this! Yes, let's listen to Bob. He's the idea man behind the shark. He pooh-poohed all my safety concerns, by the way. What? Thank you. I have to run. N-No, I said it might be cool to get a mechanical shark. I didn't turn it loose. Yes, he did! No, I didn't! Nobody knows who did! Yeah, stop this insane witch hunt! It could've been anyone who wasn't at the library. The library? It's no use! They know we knocked the shark over! Wait, what? You did? No! That's just an expression. Hey, did you knock over the shark today? You know I did! You're the family from hell! They're destroying the town! Let's have a town meeting to decide what to do with the Belchers! (screeching) Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! Teddy, what are you doing? I'm trying to get everyone's attention, but I don't have any nails. Okay, so what do you want to say? I have something to say. Yes. What? I told you not to get that shark! I told you he was trouble! Now we need to join together to stop him. Ow! Don't you see? Us fighting with each other, that's what he wants! Ow! Teddy, stop! Yes, Teddy, thank you. Thank you. So, yeah, we've got to join together to stop the shark. Let's put our heads together, right? Block captain brainstorm. No bad ideas. Go. Topless car wash, like in the movie! Topless car... Don't write that down. Uh, Linda said there were no bad ideas, Bob. Well, she was wrong, Hugo. (muttering): Yes, like when she married you. What? What? I heard you mutter something. Yes, and when someone mutters, that means they're muttering to themself. (muttering): Huge mistake. Well, I heard you. What? I heard you mutter. Oh, really? What did I say? "Linda made a huge mistake." So we agree. Ha-ha. Someone else? Listen to me. I know how the shark thinks. It's confused. It doesn't know why you want to k*ll it. It just wants to go home. Tina, it's a machine. It's dumber than our toaster. Our toaster is also confused. It doesn't know why we put bagels in it. Oh, my God. Okay, we got four good ideas. Well, four Hail Marys we could try. (chants): Let's stop the shark! Or not. All: Let's stop the shark! Or not! Let's stop the shark! Or not. (mechanical whirring)   (metal clanging) If a spike strip can stop those drunk Shriners, it should be able to stop a shark. Here it comes! Here it comes! Ouch. Okay, we've given the shark spikes. I knew that would happen. Bob: That oil's gonna keep the shark from getting any traction. Ah... And we made it faster. Bravo, Bob! You want to catch a fish, you gotta think like a fisherman, right? Okay, now the shark is electrified! All you're doing is making the shark more dangerous, Bob. I can see that, Hugo! It was an FYI. Bob, the shark's getting pretty close to our restaurant. It's all right. We've saved the best idea for last: the big hole. Why'd we save our best idea for last? Because we didn't know it was the best idea until the other ideas were really terrible. Stupid. Anyway, we dig a big hole, the shark falls in and hopefully, end of our problems. Beginning of China's problems! Sorry, China! They'll nail it. They're really smart. Linda: Come on, keep going. Climb into your hole, you big mouse! (quietly): Turn around! It's a trick! (cheering) Ah-ha-ha! You did it, Bobby! The shark is gone! Gone, but not forgotten. Wait, what are we talking about again? Maybe you're not such a horrible, greasy, perverted, shabby, two-bit, filthy, disgusting pig. All right, thanks, thanks. (rumbling) What was that? That thing's still moving down there. But we buried it. (cracking, rumbling) I think it just ate its way into our basement! (dramatic musical sting) Dad, can we keep it? The shark is in our basement?! Well, there's only one way to find out for sure. Kids, stay here. Duh. Yeah, I thought our basement was scary before it had a shark in it. Bob, stop. You've done everything you can. You don't have to go down there. This whistle says I do. Gene: That whistle blows! (blows raspberry) Enough talk. This ends now. Mort and I will go with you, Bob. What? Oh, I mean, yes! Thanks, guys. That means a lot. Oh, good news, everyone! The dream team's on it! Ahab, Gray-hab, and Flab-hab! You want to come, Hugo? No, I'm good. Crowd control. Back up! Back up! Real quiet, all of a sudden. Quiet as a morgue. Morgues aren't all that quiet, actually. Maybe it finally ran out of gas. We could come back tomorrow. No! We gotta make sure it's dead, and then we gotta cut it up in little pieces so it never hurts anyone again! Whoa, Teddy, calm down. What happened with you and that shark, anyway? Sorry, Bob. You see, It's personal between me and this shark. We had a little run-in, back when I was working on that movie... I was chatting up that cute surfer girl. (distorted): Ohh...! (snickering) (distorted): Ugh! Well, you can forget about getting any of this! She could've been the one, Bob! I hit the craft service table pretty hard after that. That's when I started getting fat. Uh, I don't understand. Why aren't you mad at the shark operator? Oh, yeah, that's a good point. No, no! The shark drove him to it. It's evil, and now I'm fat. You're not that fat, Teddy. I'm wearing a guy girdle. It's called a Boydle. Look at me. Look at me! Okay, Teddy... Well, you know, look at me. (falsetto): Hi, Teddy. I'm Bob's belly. (both laughing) Oh, you always know what to say, Bob. Mort: Over here! I'm Mort's belly. Huh? What? We're not doing that bit anymore? What's going on in there? (rumbling) Did you guys hear that? (all yelling) Oh! We're gonna need a bigger restaurant! Oh, come on. Sorry. (all yelling) Hang on, Mort! (grunting) Not... fat... enough! (yelling) Mort!! No! I think Mort got eaten. Oh, I should've laughed more at that belly-talking thing he did. Mort, are you okay?! (Bob and Teddy yelling) I'm out! I'm literally grasping at straws! (yelling) Ahh! Teddy, you're being crushed! No, my Boydle's protecting me, but I don't know how long it's gonna hold! This is what you want, isn't it?! (hollow thudding) This is what you want! I'm torn. Dad raised me, but the shark gets me. If the shark eats our restaurant, is he our new boss? Shark boss! (chomping noises) I'm blacking out, Bobby! I don't know how to stop it. We've tried everything! It's too bad we can't make it die from cancer, like in the movie. It didn't die from cancer, Teddy. Oh, no, you're right. They sh*t the cancer ending, but it tested really bad. It didn't have the "pow." Really? Cancer? No pow? Yeah, they sh*t a whole new ending, remember? They went and poured wet cement down its throat. Yeah, and that would be really helpful if we had a cement mixer! (door bell tinkling) Maybe we do. The ice cream machine. She's right. We could fill up the shark with ice cream. That might mess it up, right? I chose you, Dad. Thanks, Tina. Over the shark. Thanks. Because I thought... Yes. Originally, it looked like maybe I would... Yes. Oh. Yeah, Dad, who was Tina really gonna choose? A broken-down wreck with the dead eyes, or a fake shark? Aww... You like that, Mom? Yeah. Okay, let's give it a try. All I have to do is plug it in. Ow! Hurry, Bob. Some of the teeth are getting under the Boydle! (Bob groaning) Stretch, Bob! Stretch! You call that stretching? Got it! (shuddering) My feet are getting cold. Must be making ice cream. (grunting) Oh, my Boydle came off! You got my Boydle, but you don't got me, you shark! Linda: It's working! The shark's getting all logy! I've had dreams like this. It's over. No, Bob. (yelling fiercely) Die! Die! Die! Now it's over. No, it's not dead! Just kidding, everybody. Just kidding. How shark was it? I still feel like I'm doing that wrong. (bell tinkling) Whoa, Bob! I love what you've done with the place. Listen, I'm gonna be out of town for awhile, but, uh, keep it up. Uh, we-we should talk about repairs for... No. Okay. I'm going to miss you, shark. Hmm, I'm gonna miss you, too, ice cream machine. He died the exact way I want to go: destroying the restaurant. Hey, how the hell are we gonna flush this thing down the toilet? Whoa, somebody lost their Boydle! It's mine now. (grunting) Ah, my little Bobby Block Captain. You saved the town. Eh, just part of the job. Gene: You're fired! I can't take credit for everything, Olsen, but as quadrant captain, I will. You're welcome. Who wants soup?
Wow, still can't believe this sale. Six thousand low-fold dispenser napkins for $58? What are they thinking? I don't know. Yeah, and they're two-ply. This is... this is a great day. A really great day. Wow, look how big and empty the parking lot is, huh? (low whistle) What do you say you get behind the wheel? What would I do behind the wheel? Drive. Is that legal? Well, no, but my father let me drive when I was about your age. Call it a perk for running errands with your dad. Let's make this kitty purr. Mm, go ahead. Try a turn. (Tina groans) Tina, why are you groaning? You're doing fine. (groaning louder) Rela... Tina, relax. Easy, easy. (continuous groaning) (chuckling): Okay, okay. Tina, you're kind of headed toward the only other car in the lot. You have plenty of time to turn, Tina, so just go ahead. Turn one way or the other... You're just swerving back and forth. Turn one way and stick with it, Tina. (continuous groaning) Tina, for the love of God, turn away or stop! The brakes, Tina! On the left! You're about to hit that car! The brakes! Hit the brakes! Oh, my God, it's bad. I ruined the car! You did. You really did. Okay, uh... Well, that's... Ugh. At least there doesn't seem to be any damage to the other car. No, I see a dent! There's a dent! That-That's a ding. Not even. It's like a little scratch. N-No, it's a dent! All right, we'll leave a note. You know, then again, for all we know, that probably was there, right? We have to leave a note! We have to leave a note! Okay, okay! You're- You're so honest. Who raised you? I don't know. Da... It was me. I did. (bell dings) What's with the cab? Yeah, where's the car? Um, the car is in the shop. There was a little accident and... What?! Wait, Lin, Lin. What? What happened? Calm down. We hit a parked car. Are you okay? What happened? My baby, wa... Look at me. Look at me. Oh, God. We're fine. Tina is fine. Oh, my baby. Oh, my baby. Wait, how'd you manage to hit a parked car? Are you drunk? No. You smell like wine. (chuckles) We-we were coming out of the restaurant supply store and... (phone rings) Hold on. Bob's Burgers. Oh, hi, Jimmy. Yeah, he's right here. It's Jimmy Pesto. Ugh, what does he want? Hello, Jimmy. Hello, Bob, want to hear a knock-knock joke? No. Knock-knock. I'm really not in the mood. Knock-knock! Ugh, who's there? You hit my car, dumbass. Eh, classic knock-knock. You've got to be kidding me. That was your car? Did you or did you not hear my knock-knock joke? O-Okay, look, what happened was... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, tell it to your insurance company. Oh, come on, Jimmy. I don't want my rates to go up. I'll just pay whatever the damage is and... No way. Not on your salary. I don't have time for you to work out an eight-cents-a-month payment plan. Ha. He's poor. (groans) Fine. We'll go through my insurance. Good-bye! You drive like a fart! Fart. So what happened? So anyway, I was driving, and I ran into what turned out to be Jimmy Pesto's car in the parking lot. But, Dad, I was... Come on, Tina. Help me carry the napkins down to the basement. Okay. Help you carry napkins? Yeah, Dad, be sure to lift with your legs. Bob: Ha-ha. Use the hand truck. You shouldn't be carrying anything at your age. Yeah, you're pregnant. You sit down, Dad. Hey, while your car is in the shop, I can drive you guys around. Oh, thank you, Mort, but we don't need to go anywhere. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, we'd get to ride in the hearse? There's lots of places we need to go. What? Where? Nightclubs, day clubs, smoky cafes... Chinatown, Thai Town... Library. Great, I'm heading out now if you want to come with. I call shotgun. I call coffin. No fair, I want coffin! Good, it was a trick! I'm too scared to ride coffin. So we just have to say I was driving, okay? That's lying. That's not right. That's true, Tina. Lying is wrong, and you should never do it. Unless an idiot named Jimmy Pesto makes you go through insurance, which he is. So we have to lie this one time. What's next? Perjury? Human trafficking? Look, our insurance will go up a little, but we'll be fine. We just can't tell anyone about it. Even Mom? Ugh, especially Mom. She can't lie. But I can't lie, either. You know what, it's not even really a lie. It's a secret. It's our shared secret. Huh, maybe if I had a backstory? A backstory? Do I have a boyfriend in this scenario? Uh, we should probably just stick to the necessary facts. Oh, okay. Fine, all right, you have a secret boyfriend in this scenario. One that you can't ever talk about. What's his name? Um, Sebastian. He plays lacrosse, and he loves me. Mm-hmm. But he loves lacrosse more. Uh, yeah. How long is his hair? I-I-I don't know, but it's greasy. Yes. So Mort, what special features does this baby have? Special features? Like what? You know, like an oil slick in case you're being followed by mourners? Oh, no, no, nothing like that. Is there a hammer in case one of them comes back to life? No, no hammers. I guess you have to use your bare hands then. You're cute. Yeah. Whoa, how'd you swing that? Oh, the police escort? In addition to giving you kids a lift, I'm also on my way to a funeral. k*ll*ing two birds with one stone. So there's a dead body back there? And two birds. And two buns! Go, go, go, go, go, go! Take that, po-po! Come on, kids, please. This is not... Sorry! Oil slick, go. (hissing) Why are you wearing a hair net? Because stress is making my hair fall out. Look at me. Tina, you have the fullest head of hair in the family. I would k*ll for that hairline. I believe you would. Take it easy. Take it easy. This is all wrong. I'm going to jail. Or hell. Or hell jail. What's for lunch today? Your lies! No! That's what we had yesterday. Look, I know it's hard, but I swear it will get easier. Just hang in there; we'll get through this. (bell dings) Hey, there. What can I get for you? Oh, I'm not having anything, but I do have a few questions. I'm Chase Kaminsky, your insurance adjuster. (groaning) What's that sound? Uh, uh, what sound? (groaning continues) I don't hear anything. Oh that, that, yes, I hear that. That's probably my daughter. Is she all right? I-I-I think it's a song. She's always singing, so... it's probably a song. You know, kids and their music. (thud) Uh, oh. She passed out. Better go check on her. Everything's fine, Tina. We're going to go out there and act like we didn't do anything wrong, which we didn't, kind of. But lying to Mom was one thing; lying to the insurance guy is another. (groaning) Okay, stop, stop making that sound. He hears it. Okay. All right, let's-let's have you go down to the basement and, um, sweep something. Like dirt? Yes, like dirt. So, I was in park, but I thought it was in drive, so I was thinking, "Uh, why am I not moving?" Yeah, well, we've all done that. I mean, I haven't, but somebody must have. We... you did. (laughing) Yeah, I did. (forced laughing) Oh, God. Uh, this is my daughter, Tina. Laughing is another one of her noises. Oh, is that laughing? I was in the car with my dad. Uh, in the passenger seat, she was. Yeah, where passengers sit. Right, so after I put it in park, and I was moving, I thought, "Am I in neutral?" So I shifted into gear and lurched forward. And then a butterfly flew in the window and Dad started swatting at it. (bell dings) A butterfly? What butterfly? Wha-What butterfly? Hey, Linda, kids. Uh, this is Chase. He's from the insurance company. I was just telling him what happened, uh... Uh, yes, I was... I was just getting to the butterfly part of the story. I thought it was a bee, and I was startled. So I was, ah... swatting at it. Dad's scared of butterflies. Uh-oh, Dad, look out. There's a ladybug! Stop it. All right, so, uh, anyway, back to the story, uh, Chase. Uh, I mean, not a story; it's the truth. Um, so I swerved and... A cormorant flew in the window. What's a cormorant? It's a kind of seabird. We learned about them in school. In China they use them to catch fish. Yeah, thanks, Tina. Sorry I left out the cormorant. Gene: A cormorant? What an auspicious sign. Anyway, that's how I hit the car. Butterfly, then cormorant. Okay! Really? We'll get your claim check cut right away. Thanks for your business, Bob. (bell dings) Thank you. That was easy, right? Phew. One more thing. Aah! Aah! It just occurred to me to ask you... Here it comes. I'm hosting a barbecue this Sunday. My caterer fell through. Boom, I meet you. What do you say? You ever take this show on the road? Oh, um, cater your party? Mm-hmm. Sounds great. We'll do it. Our only other employees are the kids. Is that... is that okay? Great! Here's my number. Huh. See you all on Sunday. Great. Where's the bathroom in this thing? Under here? No. No, it's not there. Yeah, it's fine. Well no, just... Can you just hold it a little longer? Well, it's not a problem. No, no, please. Don't worry about it. I'm meeting a grieving widow in ten minutes. Oh, I have to go, too. Hey, look! "Three bedroom, two bath." We can both go. Ah, all right. But make it quick. Got to go. Got to go. Got to go. Everything okay in there? Everything's great. I had to pee, but one thing led to another. Bam, I showered. So our grandpa died. That's him out front. He's in the to-go box. His last wish was to be buried at the house he was m*rder*d in. Yeah, with the shovel he was m*rder*d with. Can you believe he was poisoned with a shovel? (stammering) We'll take it! Kids. Ah, perfect timing. Mortimer, give this fellow a fair price for the house, and we'll meet you in the car. Hey, thanks for the lift, Mort. Uh, shouldn't be more than a couple hours, so, uh... are you gonna wait here or come back? Well, it's an hour back to my place, so I guess I'll just sit in the hearse. Maybe grab a nap in the back. Uh-huh. A nap in the back of a hearse? Who says morticians are creepy? Ha-ha. Well, all this gas is getting pretty expensive. A hearse doesn't exactly sip gas. It's a big vehicle, you know? Uh-huh. But you know, if you would like to chip in that would be so great because... Great, we'll see you in a few. Okay. All right. See you soon. That's fine. Why are we even here? You said it would all be over after the one lie. Well, we couldn't exactly say no to Chase, Tina. That would make it worse. After the barbecue, I promise, everything will go back to normal. Will it? Or is that another lie? Whoa, easy. You've gotta calm down. Let's, let's, let's see your "everything is okay" face. Um, no, no, no, that's, that's not, that's... No, that's bad. No, don't do that face. Like, like this? No. Just stop doing the face. How about this? And stay with me here by the grill. That way your sweat will look more natural. So then a butterfly spooks him, and he crashes our freaking car! (laughs) Hey, your wife has 'em roaring over there, talking about your little fender-bender. Uh. Uh, Tina, I'll be right back. Mm... Just try and keep the meat off the ground. Okay... You heard of the butterfly effect? If a butterfly flaps its wings, Bob crashes his car! (laughs) Okay, Linda. Let's, uh, settle down. Oh, what? I'm making conversation. And he says I'm a bad driver! Tina: Ah! Ah...! Ah...! Tina! Oh, call the fire department! Oh! Oh! Oh! Ooh! Ooh, my face! Tina, no one's blaming you for this, but what wrong thing did you do?! I don't know. I was cooking like normal. Maybe I had the flame too high? Why would you let me around fire? All right, Tina, calm down. This is, this is bad, but it was an accident. We'll, we'll tell Chase we're sorry. And that we lied about the car accident. What?! No. No-no-no-no-no-no. We're, we're in too deep now. We have to stick to our story. Oh, this is horrible. It's horrible! We barbecued that poor man's house. (gasps) Wait, who's this "we"? I was locking Gene in the garden shed when Tina was playing Firestarter. I burrowed out like a little mole! (growls) Louise is right. I'm a firestarter and a jinx. Yep. And I'm going to destroy this family. You're the reason I'm fat! I know. Oh, my God, Chase. I, I don't know what to say. We're, we're so sorry. (house creaks) Bob, it's okay. This was still a better-than-average party for me. Really? But your, but your house. Your-Your really nice house is gone! Well, this might surprise you. I have insurance! (laughs) (sporadic laughing) Yeah, I lost a lifetime of memories and my cat Spritzal. I k*lled your cat?! Well, no, Spritzal died last week. Natural causes. She's, uh, she's peeing in God's shoes now. Too soon! But her ashes were in there. Well, technically, they still are, aren't they, buddy? (sobs) Look, you all go home and just forget about this, okay? I'm just so grateful that no one got hurt. Ow. Coming through! I'm a firestarter and a jinx. And I'm going to destroy this family. We're in too deep now! We have to stick to our story! (both scream) Huh?! Wha...?! (screams) Screaming! (keyboard plays sampled scream) Wha...? Wha...? Gene! What the heck is going on? My stomach is in knots. Did you eat rope again? Tina, sweetie, is this about the fire? Because houses can be rebuilt. No one was in it, honey. But my conscience is still on fire. Okay, enough. I, I can't stand to see Tina like this. Listen, I lied about who was driving our car during the accident. Huh?! I let Tina drive a little in the parking lot. No fair! Mort doesn't let us drive! And then I made everything worse by lying about it. Why didn't you tell me? Because you're terrible at keeping secrets. You just blurt everything out. Sorry we're late! Bob had diarrhea!  Running down the gutter  With the piece of bread and butter, diarrhea.    (makes fart noise) Lin! I love you, Mom. Anyway, I shouldn't have kept this from you. I was wrong. (keyboard scream) Stop it. I'm going down to Chase's office first thing in the morning to come clean. I'm going with you. Yes! Good. We'll tell some truth! "Hey, while your car's in the shop, I can drive you guys around." Why did I say that? What's wrong with me? Oh, hey, guys! What can I do for you? Hi, Chase. Uh, I have something I need to tell you. Is it about my dead fish? 'Cause I already know. I wasn't driving when I had the car accident. Tina was. It's true. I was. (sighs) I knew that. You knew? You knew? What, you thought you were fooling me with that cockamamie story about a butterfly and a bird? A cormorant. Whatever. Of course I knew! I figured if I scratched your back, you'd scratch mine. Wait. I-I don't want to scratch your back. You already did. Tina's "accidental" fire? No accident. It was an accident, I swear! What are you talking about? We're all in on this, compadres! I looked the other way on your fender-bender. You gave me a convenient cover to burn down my house. Why would you burn down your own house? 'Cause I'm covered for twice what it's worth. And no one is gonna question my claim when little Tina was left in charge of the grill. How did you know I was going to start a fire? Well, you didn't. My good buddy odorless kerosene did. Ugh! So I'm not a jinx. I, I can't believe what you're saying. Well, believe this. It's your cut! My cut? I'm... I'm not taking your money. Oh, think about it, you two. We'll be the three amigos of insurance fraud. Restaurants are disaster magnets! Broken pipes, slip-and-falls, her. Aw... Hey. I make sure you get the maximum payout, minus a small percent, of course. Hey, we're not gonna commit insurance fraud. Yeah, that doesn't sound like something you'd do. Oh, wait, you already did! Your daddy could go to jail! Huh?! Huh! Huh! Chase, you can't be serious... Huh! Huh! Serious as a judge. Judges, by the way, are most interested in the testimony of the insurance adjuster. And I will testify against you. Oh, I got it! You'll flood your basement! Why are you doing this to us? Because you're my golden goose. And I'm not letting you get away. You are the worst insurance adjuster. But the world's greatest uncle. (clicks tongue) So, Chase is blackmailing us. And if we don't go along with his scam and flood the basement, he's gonna turn me in. Flood the basement? But my collage supplies! They're just magazines, Mom. They are '90s Cosmopolitans from the '90s. Lin, let's focus on the blackmailing. Huh! Huh! We gotta take that son of a b1tch down! Language. Sorry, Mom. Tina's right. We need to come up with an idea to get us out of this. Huh! Huh! Huh! Tina, stop doing that. It's disturbing and scary. Wait. That's it! What is? What if we scare Chase so bad he'll never want to see us again? Hmm. That could work. Scare him? How? Boo! Ah! (bell jingles) Good morning, Bob! Or should I call you "Rob" since we're gonna be stealing money together? I'm sorry. It was too good to resist. Yeah, that was hilarious. Uh, so anyway, my basement flooded. Luckily, we're covered. Uh, Bob, will you send the kids up? Their breakfast is getting cold. They aren't down here. What are you talking about? Of course they are. They were playing down in the basement. The basement?! Bobby, what's the matter? My babies! No...! Agh! Agh! Oh, my God, no...! I went too far! What have I done?! My kids...! My children are dead! Bobby, why?! Bob, I can't handle this! I never saw this... Okay, I'm leaving! I'm sorry! You'll never hear from me again! And... scene. Eh? Great performances by all three of us, huh? Oh. You figured it out. Come on. You didn't really expect me to buy that, did you, Bob? Uh, sorta. Yes. Your acting is terrible. You closed the door. You didn't even try to resuscitate your kids! Yeah, It turns out the kids can't hold their breath that long. And we were gonna give 'em snorkels, but, uh... Snorkels. Yeah, uh, you know what? Never mind. Snorkel. Kids, come upstairs. Now let's get this paperwork started! Get this claim processed! And remember, this stays just between us. No one can ever know. Bob, Lin, oh, good. You're, you're both here. Listen, I, I got something stuck in my craw. Not a good time, Mort. Uh, you know, it's never a good time for these things. You're my neighbors and I love you, and I, I love your kids. I mean, up to a point But I'm not a taxi, okay?! All right. Sorry, That came out wrong. A little over the top. Let me, let me start over. Look, we're getting our car back tomorrow. So we don't need any more rides, Mort. Yeah, we left you a note and a thank-you package on your doorstep. Oh, so you did. Okay. Well, I mean, that wasn't necessary. What a lovely surprise. All right, I'm gonna go now. Okay, Chase. You, you caught us. But you're playing with fire... Fire. ...and water, literally. And eventually, somebody is going to get hurt. (bark sound) Gene, stop it! Ah! Don't insult me, Bob. You're new to this. I'm the pro. I've pulled hundreds of scams, and I'm gonna pull hundreds more. Now for our next fraud, I'm thinking lightning. A big surge could mess up all these incredibly expensive appliances. Am I nuts? Yes. Well, off to process this flood claim. Talk soon, partner! Oh, my God. We're stuck with this guy forever. Like me and this piece of corn in my teeth. Right, corn? Are we? I've pulled hundreds of scams, and I'm gonna pull hundreds more. Ha! Tina, that's brilliant! Oh, sure, when she does it, it's brilliant. That scammer is going to the slammer! Buh-bye, baby! Tina, do you realize what this means? You saved the family. I guess it's all part of learning to drive. (farting) (lion roars) (lasers firing) (farting) Uh, the, this one. For our next fraud, I'm thinking lightning! Hey! Hey, Bob! Bob, look! (mimics tires screeching, crash sound) That's you. Well, I'm glad this week is behind us. This was the worst week of my life. But I'm better for it. This was the worst week of your life, Tina? You got to crash a car and burn down a house! I got to do nothing! Fine. Here, Louise, you can break this plate. Ah! No fair! I want one! Yeah! That felt good. I want another one! No, that's it. Here, give me one! Stop! Lin, what are you doing? What? They're... I hate these plates. Stop breaking plates! Lin! Ah! Ah-ha-ha, it's fun. Smash! Watch me break this plate and the window! No!
Hey, remember my fart from last night? Be more specific. Maybe this will ring a bell. (fart noise) Oh, yeah. (farting "Yankee Doodle Dandy") I taught it to love its country. It's "Stankee Doodle Dandy." (laughter) Cool. Play something else. Play "Happy Birthday" 'cause my birthday's coming up. Play "Happy Stankee Birthday." Do it. Do it. It'll be funny. Do it. Hey, Courtney, take a chill pill. (gasping) Oh, my gosh. Uh... No, it's all right. No, guys, guys. I will take a chill pill, I will. Because I have a congenital heart condition, and I take them every day. I had shingles once. I have a cut on my leg. Those things aren't congenital. (school bell ringing) Show's over. We got to get our congenitals to class. (door bell dings) Hi, Lin. Hey, Gretchen. Just came by to return this bottle of water you left at the salon. When did I leave that there? Two weeks ago. Oh. Hey, do you guys have a lost and found? Yeah. Why? What'd you lose? 15 pounds. Look at me. Oh, yeah, you lost weight. Good for you. Wow, what's your secret, Gretchen? I went on the Skin Deep diet. You can only eat fruits and vegetable skins, and the weight just fell right off. One time, I accidentally ate a banana peel, but I didn't look like you afterwards. (laughter) Whoa. Humph, err... Well, I got to run. Hey, Gretchen. Wow, you look great. Did you lose weight? Little bit. Look-- my tattoo's not stretched out anymore. It almost looks like a regular dolphin. Wow, yeah. Look at my thigh tattoo, Bobby. Oh, let me pull my shorts up here. It's okay. Okay. All right. Bye, Gretchen. Bye, everybody. Bye. You're perfect the way you are. Don't lose one more pound. I won't, probably. I don't know. (laughs) Gretchen looks good, huh? Yeah, I guess she looks all right. Why is your eye twitching? Because I'm very happy for her. So what if she's the hot one now, and I'm the one with the muffin top. Oh, come on, Lin, you look great. I like your muffin top. So you think I have a muffin top? What? No, no, I said... No. I'm going on that diet, Bob, and when I'm done, I'm gonna look like Gretchen's skinny sister. Gretchen's sister is skinny, Lin, but it's because she's on methamphetamines. Whatever works, Teddy. Don't judge! (sucking, snorting) If you guys are trying to cut the line, forget it. Lenny's giving us backwards cuts. Backwards cuts? They found a loophole. Hey, Gene, guess what? What, Rupa? I know someone who likes you. Is it Lenny? 'Cause I want backwards cuts. I think she means someone like-likes you. Uh-huh. Oh. Is it the school nurse? She said I was the perfect temperature. Can't tell you. It's a secret. Aw, I guess we'll never know now. Well, whoever she is, I hope she appreciates that I can do this. Ah, ah, baa, baa, ba. Dun dun da-dun-dun, baa-baa. I don't get it. Bop. Bop. I try and try and he ends up with the secret crush. Maybe don't try so hard, girlfriend. Okay, I see your point. Who do you think like-likes Gene? "Puberty, puberty, puberty." That's all I hear when you guys talk. But we're his sisters. What if we don't approve of her? Oh, judging people. Well, when you put it like that... Bad hair, bad breath, bad attitude, eyes, nose, mouth, posture... So, we know it's not Sarah, Wendy or Lizzie. Maybe it's Julie? Nah, she like-likes Lenny Destefano. Geez, who isn't on the Lenny Destefano train. It sold out even before it left the station. Uh-huh. What about Rupa? Maybe she told us about the secret crush to throw us off her trail? No. Rupa's not that smart. She thought elbow macaroni was made of elbows. Oh, (forced laugh) and that's not true. Maybe it's someone we're not thinking of. (both gasping) Both: Courtney Wheeler! (both screaming) Hi, Gene. I heard somebody like-likes you. Do you know who it is? Nope. (screaming) She's in your grade, and she thinks you're really cute. And she has blond hair. And she's looking right at you. It's me! (laughs, snorts) Oh, boy. (screaming) So, do you like-like Courtney? Do you want to go out with her? (screaming) Uh... (screaming) Uh... Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. You like-like her, right? Yes. Uh... (screaming) I guess? (giggling, screaming) Oh, my God, I can't believe he said yes, But he did. You guys are going out. Let's make it official. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. (screaming) Aw. Uh, is this forever? Oh right, I forgot. Gene: Oh, no. There it is. It's all, eh, written down. (snorts) Uh-huh, uh-huh. All right. Well, thank you. Bog Harbor Catholic has an opening. You'll just need to wear a skirt and go by the name Eugenia. Louise, what are you talking about? Gene's switching schools. Gene, why do you want to switch schools? (gasps) Are you being bullied? Who's hurting my baby boy? I wish I had a bully. This is way worse. Courtney Wheeler like-likes him. Oh...! Courtney asked Gene if he wanted to go out with her, and he said yes. All right, Gene, you're on the board. Way to go. I hear dating bells. So, who's Courtney? Courtney Wheeler is the most annoying girl in my grade. In school. In the world. Oh, well, what's so bad about her? She talks too much, she breathes too loud, and she's always sucking on her necklace. (slurping noises) And her breath smells like sweat. Yeah, and she talks on her phone when she goes to the bathroom. It's confusing. Courtney: Hey, how's it going? Good. Thanks for asking. I'm in the bathroom. Where are you? I'm in the bathroom, too. I thought you knew that. Sorry, hold on. Some girl thinks I'm talking to her. Oh, well get rid of her. I'll wait here. Gene, then why did you say you'd go out with her? Her friends were staring at me! I didn't want to be a jerk, Dad. Well, you're not being a jerk if you don't like her. Like-like her. Like-like her. Your father's right, Gene. When did Mom start eating garbage? These are potato peels. I'm on the Skin Deep diet. I'm only allowed to eat fruit and vegetable skins. It's delicious. You know, the longer you wait, the harder it's gonna be to tell her how you really feel. Oh, yeah? When are you gonna tell Mom how you really feel? Linda: Huh? Huh? What'd he say? Hi, Gene. Hi, Courtney. Both: Aww. So cute. We're walking into school together. 'Cause, you know, now we're going out. Take my hand. You should know when you hold hands with me, you hold hands with everything I've ever eaten. I don't care if they're sticky. Just makes them harder to pull apart. (anxious whimpering) Both: So cute. Unbelievable. You guys, we're going in. Yech! Do you know where to hit me on my head to give me amnesia? Right here. Who am I? Tina, try again. Who am I? Tina, try again. Who am I? Tina, harder!  We go together like rama-lama-lama  Ka-ding-ka-dingy-dong  Remembered forever  As shoo-bop-shoo-wada-wada  Yipidy-boom-di-boom  Chang-chang, changity-chang-shoo-bop  That's the way it should be  Wah-ooh.... yeah!  Both: Aww.  We're one of a kind  Yech!  Like dip-di-dip-di-dip  Doo-wop-a-dooby-doo  Our names are signed  Boogity-boogity-boogity  Shooby-doo-wop-shoo-bop  Chang-chang, changity...  (Linda munching, TV playing) Mom, a whole cantaloupe skin? You sure? I earned it. All I had for breakfast was kiwi fuzz. It was like licking your father's back. Ugh. Thanks, Lin. What? Gene, let me get this straight. I'm driving you on a date with a girl who you don't like and should've broken up with by now? Like-like. Tina, I know. Actually, it's a double date. Julie and Lenny Destefano are coming. Julie better not get too attached to Lenny. That is one stallion that won't be broken. Here, Dad, you'll probably need ear plugs. And if those aren't enough, hit yourself over the head with this. I'm sure she's not that bad, Louise. Hmm... she kind of is. Ehh... you would be wrong. Prepare to be surprised. Dad, take it, take it. I don't even need it back, just take it. Good-bye. All right, well, good luck finding a drive-thru hammer store. (giggles, snorts) Kick, kick, kick. Courtney, will you stop kicking the seat? I'm not kicking. Kick. Really? I can feel it. And you're saying kick. No. It's not me. Kick. Well, Julie's too far away. And it's not Lenny. Not me, Mr. B. Oh, I know, Lenny. Maybe you're just imagining it. Kick. Did you feel that? Yes. Kick. How about that? Courtney, please. Courtney can't control her legs because she has a congenital heart condition. What do those things have to do with each other? What does anything have to do with each other? (grunts) Oh, my God. (whispering): Gene. What? She's so annoying. I know. You have to break up with her. I know. Get back in the car. We can drive away. Seriously? I think so. Forget it, forget it. It's too late. Here she comes. I don't know how to break up with her, Dad. Just.... Oh hi, Courtney. We were just talking. Just chatting. Come on, Gene, let's go, come on! I just want to finish these chats with Dad. Dad, I just want to chat with you some more. We have to go get seats in the back row 'cause people complain about the way I chew for some reason. Gene, I'm so sorry. I want to break up with Courtney, but it's so hard. My life is more difficult than anyone else's on the planet, and, yes, I'm including starving children, so don't ask. Why don't we practice? Tina, you be Courtney. Gene, break up with her. Go ahead, you can do it. Courtney, I think we should break up. Oh, okay. Please don't be sad. No, I get it. It's fine. It wouldn't have worked anyway. This is so hard! Can't I just wait till we go to different colleges and lose touch? You're doing good. You're doing good. Come on, try it with me. Courtney, I think we should break up. What?! You'll never break up with me! I will k*ll you first! (screams) Forget it. I'm not doing it. Yes, you are. Again! Courtney, I think we should break up. Nooooo! Again! I think we should break up. (screaming) Courtney, I think we should break up. I understand. Again. Courtney, I think we should break up. You're ready. (muttering): I think we should break up. I think we should break up. I think we should break up. We don't want any. Okay, bye. Hold on, wait a second. I'm kidding. That was a joke. What can I do for you? Is Courtney home? Who's asking? I'm Gene. Oh, so you're the famous Gene. Come on in, famous Gene. Uh... okay. Courtney! Hold on, I'm yell... You got to yell up the stairs. She can't hear me. Gene's down here, Court! I'm taking my pill, Daddy. Tell him I'll be down in a second. Okay, she's taking her pill. She's gonna be down... You probably heard that, didn't you? Follow me. Whoa! ("Halleluiah Chorus" playing) Where did you get all this stuff? Did your parents buy it for you? (chuckles) Yup, they did. (moaning with pleasure) You like that? Uh-huh. Go ahead. Go nuts. (drums playing) Why do you have all this? Are you Moby? (chuckling): No. I'm not Moby, but I am in the music business. I'm in the music business! Is that right? Well, I write jingles. Right now, I'm working on one for Pips potato chips.  Pop in a Pips-- Pop! potato chips  Crunch! That's beautiful. I've never met a real artist before. Well, Gene, now that you're Courtney's new friend, you got an all-access pass to gear heaven! Oh, my God! Gear heaven! (moaning with pleasure) (synthesizers playing various sounds and notes) Whee! Eeh, eeh, eeh, eeh... Whoop, whoop, whoop, wah, wah... Hey, Gene. Moby?! Hey, Gene... Gene! What'd you come over here to tell me? Um, well... (expl*si*n booms) Ooh! expl*si*n! (sucking) Uh... (synthesizer making various sounds) What is it? I just wanted to tell you that I like-like-like you! Wha-wha-really? (gasping): Oh, my God! (breathy giggle) (humming upbeat melody) Daddy...  Gene and Courtney sitting in a tree...  S-I-T-T-I-N-G! (laughing) I can make this work! (TV playing) He's back. Did you break up with Courtney? No! Better! What could be better than that? I met her cool dad. Oh, you weak idiot! Louise, stop it. Seriously, Gene, what's wrong with you? Courtney's dad writes jingles. Remember Pawsage's Cat Sausages? Oh, yeah! I remember that.  Pawsages are pawsitively purrfect! Meow!  (stomach growls) Ooh! That just made me hungry. God, Linda, just eat something. No! Courtney's having a birthday party this weekend, and great news-- I got us all on the list. Ooh! We're on the list! (stomach growls) That's right, tummy. You're coming, too. (stomach growls) What's that, tummy? No, you can't have ice cream. Count me out. Fine! Then you'll miss my performance. What performance? I'm gonna write a jingle and sing it at the party. When Doug hears it, he's gonna give me a record deal! A jingle deal. Her dad isn't gonna give you a record deal, Gene. Yes, he is! You can't keep going out with Courtney, just because of her dad. Yeah, you don't even like-like her. No, I think I might like-like her now. No, you don't. Nah, you don't, honey. Why don't you try speaking in words, instead of your damn dirty lies! Seriously! I think I do! When I shut my eyes and cover my ears, I feel like I maybe could spend the rest of my life with her. Aw... I mean, "oh." Where's Gene? Oh, he's at Courtney's, hitting on her dad. Hey, Lin, can you check the burgers on the grill for me? I can't be around food right now, Bob. You do realize you work in a restaurant, right? Don't say restaurant; it makes me hungry. You okay, Linda? Mom's cranky because she's only had fruit and vegetable skins for three days. Is your name Linda? I don't think so! Whoa. I'm sorry, honey. Come here; I'm sorry. (moaning) Come here. Come hug Mommy! Okay. Mommy hug. (sniffing) Mm! Did you use that cocoa butter shampoo? Yeah. (stomach growling) (moaning): Bu... bu... bu... Butter... butter... Lin... Lin... (muffled): What? What? Stop eating Tina's hair. (gagging) Dad, I made up a jingle for you. You want to hear it? Not really.  Have a feast for your face  Have a burger at Bald Bob's!  It was pretty good, up until you said Bald Bob. Doug says when you write a jingle, use alliteration. Oh, thanks for the lesson, Professor Jingleberry. (chuckles) Good one. I've got one for you, too, Mort.  If you got yourself a stiff  Don't dump it in a ditch  Take your corpse to Mort!    That's me! That was really good. How about this one?  Told you to break up with Courtney  And you didn't listen  And now you're stuck with her forever  So suck it!  That's not very catchy, but we'll work on it.  It's Friday, Friday, gotta get down on Friday...  (high-pitched): I feel light-headed. I'm not feeling anything. I think somebody stepped on this batch. Cake, anyone? Not for me, I'm on a diet. Bob! Bob! Take a piece of cake! I don't want cake. Just take a piece. I want to look at it, up-close. Fine. Oh, icing's like cake skin, right? What?! (smacking, moaning) Lin, get ahold of yourself. (moaning continues) Okay, I'm walking away from you now. So, Bob, I hear you're a burger man. Yep. Gene mentioned that you write jingles. You thinking what I'm thinking? I'm afraid to say yes. (humming rhythmic melody)  Blazin' beef and big old buns  Bun, bun, bun, bun-bun, bun-bun  Bun, bun!  Well, nice meeting you. Courtney: Attention, everybody. Look at me! Birthday girl talking! Come on, everyone! They make a cute couple, huh? They certainly are standing next to each other. Mr. Belcher! I said attention! He talked first, so... Well, he asked me a question. No... I didn't. Well, you did, too. Um, okay, anyway, Gene's written a love jingle about me, and he's gonna perform it now. This is more of an extended jingle jam/demo reel. I call it "Silent Love." (laughs)  When I close my eyes and I cover my ears  It's almost like you aren't here  It's a silent love-- shh!  Silent love! Shh! (quietly): Silent love. No, seriously-- shh! Talkin' 'bout silent love! Stop singing! All the ladies in the house now: silent love! Silent love? (grunts) Gene! I have to do the fellas in the house! You can't do the ladies and not do the fellas! Just be quiet! Let me sing! No! It's not a duet!  Silent love... it's a silent...  You are so annoying! What? Just stop singing! Stop talking! Stop breathing! (everyone gasps) (Courtney gasps) (siren wails, fades into distance) Do you think I've ruined her birthday? Nah. (groans) You were right, Dad. I should've broken up with Courtney a long time ago. Now I've k*lled her. You didn't k*ll Courtney, Gene. Yeah, honey, she'll be okay. Probably. Look at the bright side: You'll never have to go out with any girls again, because they all hate you. They hate me, Doug hates me... Lenny hates you. My career is ruined. Gene, Doug wasn't gonna give you a record deal. He doesn't even give out record deals. He doesn't have that power. Yes, he does! No, he doesn't. You don't know anything about the music business. (high-pitched): Look, the doctor's coming over. Tina, are you still doing helium? No... Tina! I like it. Give me some. Doctor: Gene... would you like to see her now? Uh, I'm good. Now's the time. Dad, what do I say to her? (high-pitched): Just make light small talk. Yeah, cheer her up. Make some fart noises, huh? I don't think I have it in me. (farting sound) Oh! I do! There he is. (monitor beeping, Courtney snoring) Gene, is that you? Yes. (whimpers weakly) P... Put my necklace in my mouth? (groans) (sucks, moans with pleasure) Did you really mean those things that you said? No! Well, a little bit. I'm sorry. So, you don't like-like me? No, but... I like things about you. Like your dad and his stuff. (groans weakly) You were using me. I prefer the term "networking." Gene, if you're gonna break up with me, break up with me. I can take it. (snorting) (sighing) Courtney, I think we should break up. (gasps) (steady flatline beep) Oh, my God! Courtney! Doctor, do something! There's nothing we can do. You broke her heart. (gasps) Psych! (laughter) Way to go, Courtney. You're okay? Yeah. Did you fake this whole thing? No. The palpitations were real, but we stabilized her. Thanks, Dr. Chegler. Oh, you're welcome. You should've seen your face. Did you see his face? It was very funny. You scared me! I think you kind of deserved it, after what you did to me. I guess you're right. It's okay. I'll forgive you. If you get Peter Pescadero to go out with me. Peter's got partial hearing loss. It's a perfect match. And if you clean my bedpan. (sighs heavily) Fair enough. Doug, can I still visit you in gear heaven? Nope. Not a chance in gear hell, Gene. Okeydokey. What the hell? I didn't lose a thing! You're wearing clothes; that adds a little weight. You're right. Oh, he's so smart. Yeah. Lin, no... no, no... Linda, stop. Lin, you can't take off your clothes here! Bob, I need an accurate number! Lin, this diet is making you crazy. Just take it off... You don't even need to be on it. You look great. What about my muffin top? You know who doesn't have a muffin top? People who go to the gym all the time, and who don't have kids. Don't blame us, fatty! Lookin' good! Aw! Horny little grandpa. Thanks, horny little grandpa! Well, I learned my lesson. Never date someone you don't like-like. Even if it means losing out on a record deal. That's my boy. Gene, why are you holding a bedpan? The doctor said I could have it. I'm never using a toilet again! (Bob groans) Ooh, mashed potatoes. Lin, where are you going? Lin (grunting): Hey, come back here! Oh, yeah, now I see her muffin top. Linda: Give me that! (over TV):  When I close my eyes and I cover my ears  Hmm?  It's almost like you aren't here  It's Silent Muffler-- shh!  That's my song! That's my song! Doug! ***
 Fa-la, la-la, fa-la, la-la  La-la-la-la-la  I saw three kids come sailing through  On seven days before Christmas in the morning.  Why are you putting up ninja throwing stars? I think they're doilies. They're snowflakes! They're Christmas-y. Ninja snowflakes! Hi-yah! Ha! Yah! Ow. Ow. Gene. Speaking of Christmas, here's my annual list of demands. "My own apartment." And it cannot be a studio. You have exactly seven shopping days to comply. If it rolls into day eight, there will be tears and violence. I want a dry erase board. So I can write down all my private thoughts and then erase them immediately. I want the actual Olympic bobsled used in Cool Runnings. We can't afford any of those things, kids. Not even a dry erase board? No, Tina! Sorry. Been a tough year, ever since the City Guide listed us as a gas station. Hey, a bunch of presents don't matter. Christmas isn't all about getting stuff. Yes, it is! Take it back! Take it back! (humming) Merry Christmas, Mike! Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas to you. Hi, Mike. Hi, Bob. Here's your mail. Thanks. (clears throat): Ahem. What? Ahem! Oh. Right. Of course. You know, I never know how much to tip the mailman. No, you don't. Um, you know what, here. Uh, I am going to write a number on this piece of paper. There you go. Oh, yeah, that's about right-- if I delivered mail one day a week. Fine. Here's more than that. Oh, thanks, Bob. Hey, I got something special for you, too. Special delivery. Were you not gonna give me this if I didn't tip you? No, I-I would have. Just not today. Maybe it's from Santa. It's from the law firm of Bankoff, Bostwick & Biel. (screams) Santa's suing us! Hey, it says I've been named an heir in the enclosed will of Ernest G. Lombard. Aw! Uncle Ernie's dead? But it's Christmas. Huh, I haven't talked to Uncle Ernie in years. "Talking to Uncle Ernie" would be great code for going a poop. James, he just died. It's a fitting tribute. Excuse me, who is *** this guy? He was my mother's brother. He owned Lombard's Department Store before the mall came and put it out of business. How much did Uncle Ernie leave you? Well, let's see what it say-- Hey! Hey! A-ba-ba-ba! Don't look! Let's have a reading of the will. I'll make punch. You always want to make punch. Ever heard of eggnog? I have all those sample punch packets. Ah, look, I got-- just got another one. I'm so excited! I have to go talk to Uncle Ernie! Okay, everyone has their punch, so it's time to inherit the wind! Oh, mmm. Ooh, it's good. No, it's not. Let's make a pact that we won't let the money change us. Uncle Ernie's worst Christmas is going to be our best Christmas! Okay, let's not get ahead of ourselves. Jamaican bobsled! Apartment! Dry erase board. Uh, like that. Let's just say this Christmas might not be terrible. (clears throat): Ahem! You have been bequeathed... Drumroll! (imitates drumroll) ...storage unit 39 at the Quincy Avenue Just-Stow-It. Oh. Ugh. (imitates somber rim sh*t) I still have a good feeling about this. There could be an old car in there. Or a whole bunch of fur coats. Ooh. I'm gonna throw paint on them! Remember, if it's something really good, we'll have to pay taxes on it. (all gasp) Huh? Oh, hey. We won a caveman! Who are you? My name's Chet. Uh, short for Chester, long for Ch. That's my little joke. Did you, did you enjoy the joke? Yes. Eh. I'm Tina. Shoes on or off? On, please. Can I get you something to drink? Cough syrup? Rainwater? Not that. That's urine. Why are you living in my uncle's storage unit? Mr. Lombard is your uncle? Yeah, he left me this unit in his will. Oh. Mr. Lombard's dead? Yeah. You want to come in for a hug? Um, no. Why? 'Cause we just met? Yeah, I guess. That's better. May I join you two? No. So, how'd you know Uncle Ernie? I did window displays at his store for 20 years. When the store closed, he let me stay in here. Don't you have a family or friends to stay with? You know, with Christmas coming and all that. Wait, it's Christmas? My calendar says it's, uh, da-da-da... August. (whispering): Bobby, tell him he can stay in our basement. (whispering); What? Why? Because, 'tis the season! Of what? Taking strange men into our basement? Of being nice, Bobby. He's fine right here. He's got a TV and a jar. You guys are loud whisperers. Sorry. So, you're taking over the lease? It's 150 a month. Oh. Thanks again for letting me stay here. Yeah, Bobby, you old softie. You're like a mushy snowman. A lot of space! I can't wait until the carpeting comes in. Is your heart set on this wall color? (singsong): 'Cause I have some ideas. But just to be clear, Chet, you're only here till right after Christmas. This Christmas? Um, yeah. The one that's coming up in a week. This is the nicest thing anybody's ever done for me. Including when Sal over there gave me this track suit. (whispering): If you want to give Sal something, he needs a pen1s. Fire! What?! Just kidding. Come look. What? Come on. What? What happened? Linda (sighs): Ah! Chet's gone. His pee jar is cold. I got to say, I'm relieved. There was something off about that guy. And he smelled... (clears throat) Oh, oh! It's Chet! Oh. Hey, Chet. There's my guy. What do you think of the display? Is it holi-doing it for you? You did all this? Oh, it's amazing! You gave me a place to stay, I give you: Class under Glass, by Chet. So you don't just design the displays, you're also in them? Of course. Why wouldn't I be? Well, it's a nice display. Um, thanks for doing it. How long did it take...? Chet? Chet? He's being weird again. Louise: It's been two hours and he still hasn't moved. Come on! I'm tired of pantsing him. It's like pantsing a stone. Or Grandpa. I love your display. The hats are fabulous. How much are they? Uh, we don't sell hats. We sell burgers. We still need to find a hat and something for the mailman. Please tell me you sell gift certificates. I, uh, I have a napkin and a pen, so I can write one. You know, Chet may be a strange guy, but his display really upped our foot traffic. Okay, Chet. We're closed. You can move now. (sighs): Whew! Ah! I am full of lactic acid and ideas for tomorrow's window! Ah! You're gonna do a different one tomorrow? Tomorrow and then the next day and then the next day and then the next day and then the next day and then it's Christmas, so I'll stop. Can we help? I want to be a Gene-equin! I'll be a Tina-quin. Let me print up some real gift certificates. And maybe, uh, cover the window with a big curtain, and unveil the new display right before we open. That's very theatrical. Are you gay? We wish. Chet: Okay. Anything jumping out at you for tomorrow's display? I found a train! The most civilized form of toy travel. This would look good in my new apartment. It was a joke at first, but now I'm starting to expect it. This is fun, teaming up, you know? I used to do windows with my wife, Nadine. Oh, you're married? We're separated. It's okay. What's past is past. Let's just, uh, focus on tomorrow's window. Moving on! Yeah, your new family doesn't want to hear about your old family.  When I was small, I believed in Santa Claus  Though I knew it was my dad  And I would hang up my stalking at Christmas  Open my presents and I'd be glad  Father Christmas, give us some money...  One local man has gone from homeless to "homeful" here in the window of Bob's Burgers, where you could say he's been making quite a living display of himself. Hey, look, I can see me! Look, I'm waving! Bob: Wow, this is great for us. We're on the news. The restaurant... Gene, stop licking yourself. You're on TV. Where I belong! So, Bob, what's it gonna be for the big Christmas Eve finale? I don't know what the last display's gonna be. Chet's the idea guy. Let's hear your idea, Chet. No, no, no! Don't tell me! Don't ruin it. No, you got to tell me, you... I can't handle it. No, no, no, no, no! Don't tell me. Don't tell me. (chuckles) Guy's fun to talk to. Whatever it is, it better be good. Mort's mom is coming to see it. She's got cataracts, so make it big. Linda: It's not here yet, but I want to go on record and say this is the best Christmas ever! Whoa! I know. We might actually be able to afford to buy the kids something nice. And maybe I can sneak out later while you cover for me. Yeah, I'll tell the kids you're dropping off a present for your mistress. (laughs): As if. ("Silent Night" playing) Why are you wrapping the TV remote? It's my Christmas present to Dad. He loves this thing. Great idea. I'll wrap Mom's glasses. Hey, what you looking at, Chet? I'm just zoning out. This was Nadine's favorite Christmas song. Oh, who's Nadine?  Silent night Oh.  Holy night...  (whispering): Who's Nadine? (whispering): She's Chet's ex-wife. He's missing her pretty bad. How could you not miss her? Oh, she's gorgeous! Wait, is she...? Whoo. She looks nice. Yeah, perfect posture. And wooden boobs. Chet, this is a mannequin. Back when Nadine and I got married, I was a mannequin, too. Oh, now I understand. You think you were a mannequin? Oh, it's okay. You don't need to be scared of me. I'm not one of those m*rder mannequins or satanic mannequins. I'm just a store mannequin that came to life. So happy you're staying with us in our basement.  Sleep in heavenly...    Okay, everybody out. (sniffs) (whispering): Chet's crazy, Lin. Do you think he'll k*ll us before or after Christmas? (whispering): I don't think he will. He said he's not a m*rder mannequin. You two really have to work on your whispering. So, if you're a mannequin, you won't feel this! (screams) That hurt! I didn't say I am a mannequin. I said I was a mannequin. I get it. One day, all of a sudden, you're anatomically correct. I just went through that. Well, I'm pretty sure mannequins don't turn into people, except in that one movie. This was no movie. This was retail. The new summer sportswear had just come in, and so had Nadine. She didn't have nipples, and, brother, she didn't need them. As summer turned to fall casuals, our relationship became anything but. Tina: Casual? Chet: Yes, casual. That winter, I took Nadine skiing. There was a terrible accident. (Linda gasps) Nadine shattered her right hand. Linda: Oh, God. Chet: When she came back to the store with two left hands, I knew I had to make a decision. Gene: Which hand to replace with a hook? Chet: No.Which one to put the ring on. Gene: Boo. Oh, God, Lin, are you crying? (sobbing) You know I love weddings. We were going to be together forever. Then came... the mall. Louise: Damn that mall! Chet: Lombard's had an everything-must-go sale, and my everything went. I never saw her again. Wait, why didn't she need nipples? I was so heartbroken. The pain must have turned me human, so I could feel pain. This is the greatest love story ever told. Look, Chet, there's no way any of that could be true. Well then, if I wasn't a mannequin, how come I don't know how to use a computer? Explain that, Bob. Yeah, Dad, explain that. (sighs) Don't give up, Chet. Maybe Nadine's still out there. You could find her. Hmm. Well, with a face like that, I assume she's modeling in Paris or Milan. We could help, even if it means going to Paris or Milan. Bob: Right. I bet she's in Kosovo. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. No one's helping Chet look for a mannequin who may or may not exist. She existed! Fine, she existed. And you were in love with her. But you were never a mannequin, Chet. Just move on. Nadine is probably in a dump somewhere. (Chet and Linda gasp) Oh, God! (whimpers) Kids, bed-- now. I want to talk to your father. No, kids, stay. Please stay. Go. Go! Stay. Stay! You go! Gene, stay! Now! Tina, don't move! You go! Louise, stay! Get out of here! Don't leave me! You get out of here! How could you say that in front of that poor Chet? Poor Chet? Poor us, stuck with poor Chet. Bobby, you made him cry. He's unstable, Lin. I'm sure lots of things make him cry. Oh, I'm so mad I could stomp, Gene: Do it, Mom! Do the stompy dance! Louise: She's doing it! Don't bother bringing the mistletoe to bed! But do bring me a snack. Chocolate! Mom, Dad, get up. What? What happened? You have to see Chet's window. Oh! Oh, my God. What the hell is it? He's gone murder-mannequin. Chet: No. It's the display window of my soul, Bob. This is a warning. Don't love or believe or hope in anything. Message received. I like this area. Dig deeper. People are coming to see this. Our window was on TV and in the newspaper's Christmas Countdown. You have to change it. Make it happy. My happy is gone! It's in the dump somewhere. I hope your face can catch, Bob, because I'm throwing your words back in it. Nice job, Bobby. Way to go. We have to find Nadine. Don't worry. Gene-equin knows how a mannequin thinks. Ah, a traditional Christmas mannequin hunt. All (chanting): Show us the window! Gretchen: Yeah! Show us the window! Gretchen: Now! Louise: We found Nadine! We found her! Oh, it's a Christmas miracle. I told you kids not to go looking for her-- I mean, it. You also told me to not surprise you when you're peeing, but you know you love it. (humming) Stick 'em up! Aah! Aw, Chet's going to be reunited with his long-lost love. Can't get that at a store. Where'd you find her? At a store. Oh. Gretchen: I'm gonna break it! I'm gonna break it! Oh, crap. What are we going to do? You're going to go get Nadine. That's what you're going to do, Old St. d!ck. Then Chet will have his lady love, and maybe he'll help you give those people their display. Hmm, that could work. Go! Use the back door. I'll stall the crowd. Go, go. Crowd: Show us the window! Gretchen: Yeah! (clears throat) Show us the window! Gretchen: Now! Show us the win... (clears throat) "A Christmas Poem" by Linda Belcher. Christmas, Christmas. Christmas, oh, Christmas. You Christmas you. Christmas, Christmas. C-H-I... No, C-H... R-I-S-T-M-A-S. Are you sure it's Nadine? Look at her hands, Dad. (mimics dramatic music):  Bum bum bum. Two lefties. All right, you guys stay out here. She's mine. I found her at the dump. Finders keepers. Okay, fine. But, um, could I... could I borrow her just till the end of the day? Are you kidding me? She pulls them in. And there's only one s*x shopping day till Christmas. It's my biggest day. There's nobody here. Oh, no, no, no, there's other people. They're in the back part. These finger puppets have no arms. Looks like we're going to need a diversion. Release the personal massagers. Snakes on a plane! Hey, no kids in here. Get Nadine. Come on, Dad! Let's go! Hey. Squirt the lube! Hey, you... Ow! Ooh. Ow. Uh, I'll have her home by midnight! 12:30 at the latest! Stop, you sickos! Man: What? No, not you guys.  Bells, bells, bells, bells  Bells, bells, bells, bells, la, la, la, bells  La, la, la, bells, la, la, la, bells, la...  Mom, mom. Wh-What? Wh-Wh-What? All right! Chet, we found Nadine. And we only dropped her twice. Chet: You-you...you found her? Yes, she's right here. Oh, my God, that's... Wait a minute. I don't... I'm not sure I want her to see me like this. This track suit is 12 seasons old, I've got a gut... Oh, don't worry. Nadine's changed, too. Yeah, come out, Chet, please. It-it... she really misses you. Chet: I don't know. What about all the stuff you said about how I was never a mannequin? Bob... (grunts) Look, um, I'm sorry I said that. I... I do think you need help. But before you get help, we need help. Chet: So you still don't believe me. Um, no, but all that matters is you're a man now, in love with the mannequin who I'm holding by the arm but should be in yours. Chet: Wow. I got to say that really hit me. Okay, so open the door. Tough times, huh, Baby? Well, I don't care what you had to do. I missed you. I've changed? (chuckling): Well... Yeah, I like your hair that way. It's... Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh, yeah. Well, I was... Uh-huh. Right. Chet's a really good listener. That's important to a woman. Lin, she's a mannequin. Who won't shut up, apparently. Hey, uh, guys, sorry to interrupt. Did, uh... did Nadine say anything about getting that window display going? 'Cause we... we really need to finish strong here. What do you think, Nadine? (laughing): Yes. What? What is... what is she saying? She's cracking one of her spoofs. What's a spoof? Just one of her goof-abouts. You mean like a joke or...? Nadine, you still got it. Yeah, she wants to do it. That's great. What was the joke? (laughing): Trust me, you won't get it. And remember, look alive but absolutely still. And... no action! Uh, thanks for waiting, everyone. I now give you... Christmas! (oohing and aahing) It was worth it. Mort, I want to take a picture. Fix the wig. No, your mom's. Okay, who needs a gift certificate? Thief! You stole my girl. I want her back! Oh, no. Hand her over. (gasps) Sorry. She's with me now. We'll see about that. Okay, easy. Easy, guys. Yeah, peace on Earth, smut peddler! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Aah! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa, manger danger! Aah! Come on, stop. That's a fresh take. This crèche is crap! (grunting) You're lucky I don't call the cops on you pervs. Can't we just buy her from you, please? She's not for sale. Every s*x shop owner has his price. Five grand. What? No. What about... two hundred and sixty-one, two, three dollars? No, Louise, that's the money we were going to use to buy you kids presents. Okay, that is not enough for an apartment. You can spend my gift money on Nadine. Oh, your dry erase board. You can use my money, too. Oh, your Jamaican bobsled. Fine. I'm in. But I better get a heck of a Presidents Day gift. Seriously? You're all willing to give up your Christmas presents for Chet? Aw. (sighs) What the hell? Give me the money. Well, here you go, Chet. Thanks, Bob. Sorry we busted up your display. Mm-hmm. After everything you did for me. Roof over my head, Nadine back in my arms. All right, you know what? You don't need to be out by tomorrow. Really, Bobby? You mean it? Yeah, stay till New Year's. (cheering) Aw. I'll make punch. No! Look at us, Bob, with our special ladies, huh? Yeah. We've got it all, right? We should take a trip, the four of us, you know? Ooh! Probably not. I'm flexible, wherever you want go. I'm... it-it would be hard for me to get away for a while. Well, we'll let the ladies figure it out. Bermuda! Does she have a passport? I can't wait any more, Chet. Kiss her. Mmm. Ugh. No! Oh, God. Pick it up, Chet. Five-second rule. Oh, are you as hot as I am right now? Whoa. Are you hot? I'm fine. Never mind. I think they love it. Oh, my God, it's happening. The kiss is turning her human. No, wait, it's turning him back into a mannequin. No, wait, nothing's happening. They went too far. I'm out of here. Merry Christmas, Teddy. Happy holidays, Mort. Happy holidays. Merry Christmas, guys. Burn in hell, Belchers! Uncle Ernie's storage unit had some real treasures after all. An exit sign. Thanks, Santa. Now I can go out any door I want. I got a shoe sizer. Eight and a half. I got a tool to remove security tags. Next Christmas is on me! So, Chet... what are you going to do after we kick you out? Oh, don't worry. We'll probably stay at my place in Manhattan. I have a loft that was being renovated, and I cannot wait to see how it turned out. Bob: What?!
Linda:  Dish-a-dee-do  Dish-a-de-dee, da-da-washin' the dishes  Aba-ba-ba-ba.  All right, all done with the dishes. Time for family game night. Whoo! Left hand red. Whoa-oh! I'm losing my balance. Whoa! Bob? Kids? Where is everyone? What's up? (kids grunting) Louise: Take that. And that. You naughty witch. What's, uh... what's going on? It's this thing we do with Dad. Yah! It's called "stone the witch." Dad's the witch, but it's just pretend. Right, Dad? Well, as you know, it's family game night and things are really heating up in the living room, so, you know... Come on, kids. I feel limber. I'm ready to dominate. Um, how about a rain check on that? Let me up. We're kind of in the middle of something here. Well, then I'll just play this with you guys. Whoa, ooh, here comes the blanket. That'll warm you to d*ath. Yeah. And, oh, ooh... how about this catalog? You can learn all about the season's new blazers. Wait, I'm lost. Okay, let's take five, everybody. What? No, hey, ooh, how about doilies? We can have a fancy witch with a doily hat. Hmm. Mom, it's over. You ruined it, okay? You "mommed" it all up. Uh-oh. What's that supposed to mean? Dad's here... did he "dad" it all up? Yeah, but that's a good thing. Oh, boy. Fine! I don't want to play your dumb old game anyway. Well, that's 'cause you suck at it. (gasps) Uh-oh. Ouch. Oh, God. Don't you talk to me that way, Miss Smart Mouth. You just bought yourself a ticket to your room. Oh, fine. Best money I ever spent. You can't ruin anything in there. (groans) I'm going back to family game night by myself! Oh. Oh. Oops. May I? I'd look great in that. I'd look great in that. I'd look great in that. Linda: Right foot blue. Terrific, I win. (grunting) Lin, you okay? Mm-hmm. You're not mad, are you? No, no. Okay, well, good night. Oh, you just think you're so much fun. Don't you, Mr. Fun Buns? What? I'm sorry. It's just that Louise. She's always liked you better. Ever since she was a baby. Are you Mommy's little girl? Dada. And Mama. Dada. Mama. Dada. Mama. Dada. Dada. Mama. Dada. Mama. Dada. M... Ma... Da... Da... Ma. Ma. Ma. Da. Da. Da. Da, da, da! Ma... ma! All right, you know what? Change your own diaper. Well, don't worry, Lin. She's just going through a phase. A nine-year phase... she'll grow out of it. Well, I'm not waiting for that. According to the Phenomimom... The Phenomimom? It's a mommy blog, by Dakota Applebaum. She says one way mothers and daughters connect is through story time. Phenomimom... that's fun to say. I am gonna go story that little punk. Sounds good. Louise, you awake, baby? Louise? Louise! Huh? What? What's going on? Sorry. Did I wake you up? Look what I brought. Princess Pigeon Toe... remember? Oh, no. Uh-huh. Not that book. Scootch over. (grunts) Scootch. This is a twin. Come on. There's not a lot of room. Come on, come on. Move, move, move. "Princess Pigeon Toe lived in a peacock castle on Penguin Lane." Please stop, please stop, please stop. "Every day, she went to Parakeet Park to play pinochle with Pauly the Porpoise." Oh, no! Please, just let me sleep! "Sometimes they take a picnic basket full of pickles and peppers and pumpkin pie!" Please make it stop! (squeaking) (bell rings) It's Claire and Jacqueline. Who? The most popular girls at school. How do I look? Oh, good... Hi. I'm Tina. I'll be your server today, and hopefully in the future, your good friend. That's nice. I'll have a cheeseburger. Me, too. Okay, two cheeseburgers... Claire, did you see Rachel's legs? They are so hairy. Oh, my God, I know... so gross. Right? Get a razor, girl. More like a lawnmower. (both laughing) Yeah-oh! (gasps) When did you get there? What'd you say? Nothing. Gene, hide my legs. On it! (grunting) Nothing to see here. This is just how we walk in the restaurant biz. Linda: Aw. My teeny Tina's growing up. With her little leg hairs. Just shave up to the knee. Only strippers shave above the knee. The good ones anyway. Okay. Louise: Um... who did this? I did. Oh, you did? Yes. Oh, what a surprise. Well, you left it in my room. Yeah, the Phenomi... I mean, I think it's important to create tangible expressions of our relationship. Oh, well, isn't that... Whoops. Hey, you hang that up in your room. You know you're gonna need your mother someday. Who's gonna shave your legs, huh? No one... I'm gonna grow them out all long and scraggily. (grunts) I want to look like a torso on two tumbleweeds. (laughs) And I'm gonna learn about s*x from television, so I don't need that from you, either! (grunts) Wait, maybe you should take some time to cool off. Yeah, I don't think you should shave angry. Who's angry? (both yelling) (grumbling) Uh, listen, Lin, do you think you might be forcing it a little? I'm not forcing it, Bob! Right. Louise is gonna see that her best friend is her mommy even if I have to shake it into her. Ow. Shake it, yes, shake it. Stop, no, stop. Like that. (grunts) Ooh, look. No. Yes. No, no, no, no. Yes! Okay, here we go. Going on a little errand, that's all. (groans) We need to talk. Look, I think we should spend some time apart. Mm-hmm, yeah. I'm just not really looking for something serious right now. Sure, sure, honey. You understand... I mean, yeah, it's gonna be a little awkward. You got some of your stuff at my place. We live together... We're here! Laser tag... a little dated, but all right. Not that. That! (screams) I've been kidnapped! No, she hasn't. We're fine. Keep moving. Nothing to see here. Nice blouse. Come on. No, no, no, no, no! Louise, relax. It's not like I'm torturing you. I'm just taking you to an eight-hour mother/daughter seminar. Eight hours?! Yes, our relationship needs help. Professional help. Hey! Start, damn you, start. (both grunting) No! Oh, all right, all right. 20 bucks. What? I'll give you 20 bucks if you come and do this with me. Interesting... $1,000. $28. $29.50. Deal. This is gonna be the hardest money I've ever earned. Unless you become a hooker. (laughs) ? Welcome, everyone. Welcome to my mother/daughter seminar... Modo Time. I'm Dakota. You're the Phenomimom? But you're a man. I am a man. And that's okay. The female spirit flows through all of us. We're all estro-geniuses. Everybody stand up and say it, "I am an estro-genius." All: I am an estro-genius. Oh, dear. Guys, today we are going back. We're gonna go all the way back to the womb. We're gonna get into a womb-a-tism! A what? A womb-a-tism! Ooh, a what? (grunts) No. Hi. Sorry we're late. Ooh, a male daughter. Ha-ha, Logan. Oh, God, it's here. Sorry, this was the only seminar available, and we had an incident yesterday. Logan called me the "B" word. Why must that word exist? Question. What's the "uter-room?" Well, I'm hoping what's in that room won't be necessary. Now, let Modo Time begin! Dad, I want you to drop everything you're doing and shave my legs. I'll take care of the first part. Gene. I was trying to help. Uh, Tina, can't you just shave them yourself? I tried. Oh, God! Aah! Oh, oh, dear. Oh... oh, my... aah! No more razors for you. Just wait for Mom. You wait for Mom. If I don't shave this before school tomorrow, Claire and Jacqueline might talk about me at some restaurant. All right, fine. Like a seafood restaurant or a Chinese restaurant. Tina. Or that rain forest restaurant with all the jungle sounds. Or McCormick and Schmidt's. I said I'll do it. Oh, okay, thanks. There was a time when you got all you needed from your mother through a single cord. Mothers, please strap your symbolic umbilical cords to your daughters' faces. I call them "umbilitators." That's not how umbilical cords work. Here we go... wee-ooh! It doesn't make any sense. And feed those fetuses. Down the hatch. Louise, open your mouth. Louise, open your mouth. Uh-uh. Yeah, she's fine. We're fine. Yes, open that fetus mouth! (laughs) Oh, it's fun. Money. What? Money, no... no more extorting me. Mm-hmm. Okay, fine. Five bucks... now, swallow. Mmm, oh, she loves it. (hacks) Aw. Oh, hello. You must be here for our back waxing special. Um, no. Arm waxing? No. Scrotal waxing? No... what? No! Yeah, that one. No, no, not that one. Yes. Gene, stop. You need it. Gene, shut up. My daughter needs to get her legs waxed. Hi. Oh. (laughs) Phew. I mean, not that I don't want to wax you... but no, I have my limits. Okay, well, you don't have to be rude. Why don't we just take you in the back, sweetheart? It's your job, you know. I'd wax you, Dad. Thanks, Gene. Time to be born. This is disgusting. You sound just like your father. Louise, come to Mama. Oh, no, I think I'm good, thank you. Can I get some scissors, Dakota? Do a little C-section? Those vagisacks cost $50, so... no. Speaking of money. (groans) Here. Someone's dilating. There she is. And time to swaddle the baby. No, no, no, no, no, no, no... oh, God. Snug it up, now, snug it up. No. I shaved that part. You must have been very determined. Thank you. Okay, here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna put the hot wax on your legs. Uh-huh. And then we put these strips on your legs and pull them off. Uh-huh. And it kind of hurts. Uh-huh-ah. A lot. Dad! I don't know if I can do this. Dad, you have to do it with me. What? No, no way. Yes, it's like when you got that flu sh*t to show me it was okay. Yeah, that was brave of me, but... Please? I know I act tough, but I'm not. (crying) Oh, my God... the crying. Okay, I'll do it. Yay, scrotal wax. No, Gene, not scrotal, just leg. Oh, boo! Okay, everybody, role reversal. Louise, you're Linda now. And you're trying to get your defiant daughter Louise to clean her room. Action. (quietly): Role play's gonna cost you big. (hushed): I'll pay for it when I see it. (clears throat) Hello. I'm Linda.  And I want you to clean your room  So I'm singing this song.  But I'm not gonna clean my room, la-la la-la la-la.  No-no-no-no. No singing. Wha...? I'm doing you. That's why I'm singing. You're doing me, so you don't sing. Oh, like I'm not gonna sing!  Oh, you better clean your room  I will never clean my room  'Cause I'm singing this song  'Cause I'm so rebellious!  And you're gonna clean your room!  No, I'm not gonna stop!  Okay, you two are done. Big hand for Linda and Louise. Please sit down. Great. You blew it. I blew it? You gave me nothing out there! Well, nothing is what you're getting paid for that! Whoa. Time out. Linda, have you been paying your daughter to be here? I'm sorry, Dakota, but it's the only way she'd do it. (sobbing): I'm a terrible mother. Oh, Linda, you really, really are. Everybody, everybody, listen, okay? Linda is a good mother. Mwa. Because she did it out of love. And that puts you in the running for the Most Valuable Mommy award... the MVM, everybody... which I give out at the end of the day. All right! MVM! Pshh... And as for you, I don't feel like you're taking Modo Time seriously. Oh, no, not at all. And that makes me feel negatively towards you. Well, maybe this will help clear things up. Here's your seminar. See it? It's so cute and nice in my hand, and... (blows raspberry) Did you just fart on my seminar? Ye, me, too! (blows raspberry) Okay, that's... that's fine. I think I know what we need to do here. Hey! Watch it! Get off me! You two will stay in there until you're ready to engage in this experience! Oh, almost forgot. Oh, God. What is that? It's Freaky Friday on a loop. Mom, you're old. And you're young! Wouldn't it be crazy if we switched bodies? Both: No...! (both screaming) No...! (all screaming) Oh-hoo-hoo! Oh, no, we switched bodies! What a crazy journey we are on. The logic of this movie is very unsettling! You can't do this, you monsters! All right, well, why don't you two pair up now that your children are locked away? Of course, Dakota. Come on, Cynthia. Let's you and me learn some mommy skills together. I'd like that, Linda. Dakota: And don't forget about that Most Valuable Mommy award, everybody. It's a beautiful sash. Huh. Huh. Hmm. Hmm. (grunts) Ah. I want that sash. Over my dead body. I want that sash. I love sashes. (both growl) My legs are so free. Mmm. So that's what air feels like. It's nice. (grunts) Yeah, these pants feel incredible. Why don't all men do this? Hmph! Gene, why are you making noises? They're my jealousy noises! Ugh! What are you saying? I want to wax my legs, too! These ones right here! You don't even have leg hair. Tell that to my heart! Hold on, everybody. We're making a U-turn. All right! Ow! Gentle touch, Cynthia. A mother's gentle touch. I'm so sorry. You know, Dakota, when I braid Louise's hair, I sing her a song. Ah, yes, please.  Here goes the hair and there goes the hair    Ah...  And where is Harry Truman?  He's dead in the ground, he's dead in the ground  He's dead, dead, dead...  Ow! Ow!  Well we switched bodies again, and everything's back to normal. I finally understand you, Mom. Freaky Friday's getting to me, man. They really understand each other! You pull yourself together. We got to get out of here. They just had to see things from each other's perspective. Logan, come on! We got to think! Walk a mile in each other's shoes... Oh, I swear to God, if you keep talking, I'm gonna gut-punch you! It's a beautiful story of love and acceptance. Oh, my stomach! Wait a minute. That's it! Wow. See? What'd I tell you? That is smooth. Whoa, whoa, Teddy. What, a little high up on the leg? Yeah. Sorry. There's a stop sign right here. Now feel mine. And mine. No, Teddy, don't touch their legs. Look at this. Whoa! You could wash a pan with that. Hey, maybe I'll sh**t over there and get what you got. Yeah. Nah, on second thought, I couldn't get rid of these little guys. They're my little furry friends. Don't listen to him. You're an embarrassment! No, don't listen to him. You're all right. Furry little... friends? (high-pitched voices): This is fun! Higher, Tina! Higher! (high-pitched screaming) Watch out for that bear! Whoo! Here comes a puma! (yowls) Louise: Mommy! Mommy! Logan: Mommy! Did you hear that, everybody? They're coming around. The Uter-Room is working! Oh, that umbilical soup got me, Mom. Got me real bad. Rub my tummy? Mine, too. Oh, my poor baby. (baby talk) It's wonderful. A mother's instinct at its most primal level! Come, other mothers, come and see! Mommy's gonna make you all better. Well, this mommy's gonna make you all better first. (both grunting) Now! Ha! What the hell's going on? Uh, what are... what are you doing? You fell for the oldest trick in the book. The fake tummy ache! The old belly bluff. Oh, the belly bluff! Now, if you'll excuse us, us girls... (clears throat) Sorry. Ladies... Thank you. Are going to play laser tag. Whoo-hoo! Linda: Oh, I hope those lasers hit you right in the butt! (Dakota grunting) Come on, you! Damn these delicate shoulders! Let me try. (grunts) Where'd you learn how to break down a door, Girl Scout camp? Move it. (both grunting) Announcer: No covering your sensors. No climbing on the barriers. And no physical contact of any kind. Well, agree to disagree. I feel kind of bad about locking our moms in that room. (laser trills) Ah, hey! Tina: I k*lled them. I k*lled them all. Tina, what... what's wrong? I k*lled my friendly leg hairs. Um... oh. Well, they'll grow back. It's not just that. I did it 'cause I was worried about what those girls would think of me. I'm a sheep! A hairless sheep! So you gave in to peer pressure. It happens to everybody. I mean, why do you think I wear these shoes? 'Cause you don't care what you look like? What? No. 'Cause I... No. 'Cause I saw some other chefs wearing them and I thought they were cool. Don't you think? Yeah, yeah. What do you mean? I think they're... Yeah, they're cool. Um... okay. Well, because if they don't look... if they look stupid, I won't wear them. No, they... Yeah. Forget it. Listen. Leg hair or no leg hair, you're still Tina, and when it comes to the important stuff, you'll make the right choice. Gene, put some pants on. No! Ugh. (lasers g*ns whooshing and whirring) What the hell? How'd you get out? I busted through the door. Um, we busted through the door. Fine. My shoulder and Cynthia's left boob. All right, everybody. Fun's over. Now, let's get back on Modo Time. Oh, no freaking way! You are coming back to the Nurture Center right now! You're in big trouble, Logan Berry Bush. Huh? Logan Berry Bush? We didn't think it through. Okay, everybody, calm down. Now, how do we get down there? No one goes in without a vest and a laser g*n. Well, that's not happening. I'll go down there! Linda, no! Laser tag goes against everything we've been working on. And besides... you're mothers. Uh-huh. Where's mommy's g*n?! So, welcome to the war. Okay, first, uh... let's just try to create a dialogue, and we'll... (Dakota shrieks) You're gonna get it, Miss Missy! Why don't you let your g*n do the talking, blabbermouth! Blabbermouth? (grunts) Linda, this isn't right! Feels pretty good to me! I am ordering you to put down your g*n and go cradle your daughter! No! I'm gonna sh**t her instead! Ha! Gotcha! I gave you that one! Nah! This is seriously hurting your chances of receiving the MVM award! Maybe I should give the sash to Cynthia, huh? Die, Logan! Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa, seriously? I'm the MVM? What?! The sash! Oh! That's for kidnapping me! Ooh! Aah! And that's for taking me to The Momgina Monologues! You almost k*lled your mother. I hope you're happy. I am. Any last words? Yes. I just wish... I just wish you liked me, that's all. But I guess you never will, so go ahead, put me out of my misery. Is this all 'cause you think I don't like you? Go on. Just do it. Just go. Take me out. Go ahead. (sighs) Mom, I guess I've been kind of a "B" word today. You have. But I came on a little strong. I'm sorr... You! You ruined my beautiful seminar, you little brat! And now you're gonna pay! (screams) Aah! No! My baby! Suck on this soup tube, Dakota! It's laser-flavored! Mom, nice! (grunts) (panting) Linda: Look north, Dakota. Whoa, Mom, amazing! Make my day! No, no, better before. Wait, wait. Hold on. (gasping) Hey, get off the equipment! Oh, shove it! I'm bonding with my daughter! Yeah, we're bonding here! Best therapy ever. You should have seen the way Mom took down Dakota. Phenomimom, my ass. My ass, too! Up high! Yeah, that my girl! Quit scratching, you two. Can't help it. It itches. Yeah, mine, too. Switch? Okay. Come on. Scratch like a man! Give it to me! Tina, I'm sorry I wasn't there to give you your first shave. It's okay. I regretted it anyway. But it was fun going to the waxing salon with Dad. He's a screamer. Ow, Gene! Not so hard! Aw, man! Your day sounds better. What? I want to go shave my legs with Dad and then regret it. Yeah, let's make all the same mistakes with Dad again tomorrow! Okay. Yay, Dad. Oh, screw all of you. Ah, Mom. Come here.
Hugo: Will the burger be hot enough? Hot enough to k*ll the deadly bacteria? Or is it so cool that I will shut you down? One sixty-three, one sixty-four... One sixty-five. Hot patty. It's safe. Damn it! Yay! Yay! Grade-A ground beef. Meaning we dropped it on the ground. Louise. Are we done here, Hugo? Almost. There's just the little matter of your handwashing certification. I don't see it prominently displayed anywhere. Come on, nobody needs to be certified in handwashing. Yeah! Hands off my hands, government! If you wish to remain open, you will attend a one day seminar exploring the 32 steps of proper hand sanitation. I'm not taking that seminar. Not before you watch the introductory DVD, you're not. Ugh. Come on, Hugo. And here's your "C" rating. Which will remain in your window until you graduate. What?! Hugo, you're an awful man. Uh, wrong, Bob. I'm a "lawful" man. (laughs) Falafel man. Waffle man. Omelettes. Am I doing it right? We should get going, Hugo. Who're you going to harass next, guys? Well, Bob, if you must know, perhaps you've heard our town is now home to a disgusting nude beach? There've been reports of vendors there serving food while n-n... naked. That's how the vendors served food in the Bible. Don't drag religion into this. Sorry. So long, Bob. Get certified or that "C" will stand for "closed." (laughs) Hi. I'm Andre Royo. I played Bubbles on the critically acclaimed series The Wire. Today I'm here to talk about a different kind of bubbles. Soap bubbles. Remember: When washing your hands, do it for the time it takes to count to a thousand. One... two... three... four... (groans) Bobby, when are you and me gonna go to that nude beach that Hugo was talking about? Ugh. Nude beaches are full of overweight, out-of-shape old bodies and I don't want to go there and realize I look exactly like that. I'll go with you, Mom. Mother-daughter nudity day. Fun! I'm pretty sure it's no kids allowed. No kids allowed? Hmm... Look through here and tell me what you see. Tina: It's a cliff. My turn! That's a cliff, all right. Tina, you nailed it! No, it's a cliff that overlooks the nude beach. And if we figure out how to get up there, we could sell tours... nudity tours... to teenage boys. It's like the lnternet, but outside. Yes! Hey, whoa, God! We're not even at the nude beach yet, you. Guess my boobs didn't get the memo. Ha! Linda: It's like we're in Paris. I love it. I know. C'est la vie. Let's go! Whoo! Keep hacking! Come on, guys, we're gonna be the Lewis and Clark of nudism! I'll be the Sacajawea. Of sacks! This is fun! (gasps) You already took your bottoms off! Whoa, whoa! What kind of shape is that? I don't know, it started out to be a triangle, but then I had to do it myself, and then, I don't know... it's like a flower or something. Whoa. Check out the hot guys in the drum circle. Hi. Hey, that looks like... Oh, my God! Bobby, you're not gonna believe this. He was at the nude beach! Wait, who was there? Hugo! Yeah, he was trying to shut the place down. No, he's one of them now. One of what? A nudist! Nudie! He was playing in the waves. (chuckles) Dancing around. He looked like, ah... Madonna in the "Cherish" video. Th-that's not possible. He said he took a leave of absence to be nude. So... Hugo's not our health inspector anymore? Do you know what this means? We're free! Ah! Oh, oh! No more surprise inspections! Ha, ha! No more stupid violations! And I am not going to the handwashing class! Filth! I wash my hands. Unbelievable. Hugo the health inspector is a nudist! I know, can you believe it? Gretchen and I spotted him from across the sands... Out with the bad air, in with the nude air. Don't be embarrassed, Linda. Yes, we were once an item, and true, we never saw each other nude back then... unfortunately... but better late than never. What happened? I thought you were gonna shut this place down. Oh, my investigation? Let's just say what I uncovered in that investigation was my very own soul. Wow. The old Hugo would have seen this man as a health hazard, pure and simple. The new Hugo sees only a man. A nude man selling blondies. Three blondies, please. Whoa, wai... Wha... Where'd you pull that from? My fanny pack. Where's your fanny pack? Oop. Oh-ho! There it is. Well, it kind of makes sense. I mean, the guy was wound so tight he was like a tubby little time b*mb. Teletubby time b*mb. Kids! Come in here! I have amazing news. Can't it wait? We're tired. And rashy. (grunts) Where were you? Bushwacking a trail to the nude overlook. Dad, before you say anything, know that we're gonna come out of this deal stinkin' rich! And we're gonna put a roof over you and Ma. Well, good luck. I'd pay not to have to look at those people. Hey, Dad, whoa, whoa, whoa, rewind. I'd like to hear your amazing news. Everyone, Hugo is not a health inspector anymore. He's a nudist! (door bell jangles) Ron! I think I know why you're here. Go ahead, I'll pretend I haven't heard. It's true. Hugo has taken a leave of absence. We miss him terribly and hope for his speedy return. Ha-ha! Right. All right, well, I'd like you to meet Hugo's replacement. Hey, hello, Tommy Jaronda. Pleasure to meet you. Hi. Uh... what, you're the new Hugo? Well, there's only one Hugo. Yeah, well, I'm here, so let's get into it. Oh, um... listen, Inspector, uh, Jaronda, I know you're just doing your job, but we got inspected two days ago, so... Yeah, yeah, it's cool, Bob. Yeah, yeah, you know what? Call me Tommy. Okay, Tommy. All right. I'm seeing a lot of tickytacky fouls here. What, he made you go to a handwashing seminar? That's some major B.S. Pardon my language, kids. How are you? Hello. No sweat off our ass. Yeah, that Hugo, he kind of had it out for us. Ugh. I-I can't stand inspectors like that. You know? Makes us look like turds. "No one can make you look like a turd without your permission." Eleanor Roosevelt. Ha! This kid's a trip! Funny stuff, funny stuff. You know what? I'm actually, uh... I'm starving. You hungry, Ron-Ton? You mean eat one of Bob's burgers? Hugo would never... Oh, come on, Ron. This guy... (laughs) How tall is this guy? (chuckling): He's pretty tall. The leaning tower of ta... of tall guy. (Bob laughs) I'm giving you a hard time, come here. Hey, Bob, can you grill us up a couple? Um... is this part of the inspection? Uh, yeah, something I like to call the mouth inspection. (laughing) Okay. (continues laughing) Whoa! This is incredible! Wow, first time I ever got a compliment from a health inspector. Bob, question: You like rock? Um, yeah. I like rock... music. Is that what you're talking about? Yes. Okay. You know, I play almost every night over at Pistol McSwish's Basketball and Brew. You should come by. Th-That'd be great. Absolutely. What your burger did to my mouth, my music is gonna do to your ears. (laughs) That's great... (laughs) Come here, come here. All right, all right. Get out of here, man. What are you doing? Yeah, come here. Oh. You got me. What, you punching me? I'm punching you back. I think Dad just got to second base with that guy. What are you doing this weekend, brother? I would like to visit the nude beach and see the naked people. You only live once, right, my sister? Haven't you heard? Kids aren't allowed on the nude beach. No! Unfair, isn't it? Well, what if I told you that you could see the nude beach? Mm! All the dingles... Ooh. All the dongles... Ahh. All for one low price. I want to see the dongles! Hell, yeah! Cocoa-buttered boobies! Sign up here to see the buff from the bluff! Don't be shy... they certainly aren't. Darryl: Hello, Louise. Darryl, you interested? You strike me as more of an indoor nerd. I am interested, but not as a customer... as a key member of your team. For a piece of the action? Oh-ho-ho, is that so? (laughs) It is so. If you're nudie watching from the top of a bluff, I've got something that'll double your money. Basically, this is the Hubble for boobies. I've seen my neighbor across the street put her bra and girdle on hundreds of times. Aren't girdles for old people? They are. And she is. Nice. (panting, grunting with effort) (groans) How come we're doing all the lugging? You're also doing all the yapping. Tina: Nudes, ho! Starting tomorrow, we're gonna be flush with ass-cash. Whatcha doin', Pops? Hitting the streets for some hooch? No, he's off to Pistol McSwish's to see the new health inspector play his rock. I have to go. We want to keep this guy on our side. Tommy! I was just heading out to catch your set... Bob! You're never gonna believe it! That idiot who owns Pistol McSwish's told me I can't play there anymore! What? How come? 'Cause he don't know nothin' about good rock, that's how come. Aw. Wait... Hey, I could play here. Here? Uh, what? Yeah. Nah. Yeah, no. The acoustics in here are not... No. The acoustics in here are great. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, sounds good in here. Oh, clapping. Clapping's fun. Echo. Echo. Stop. Stop. Echo. Echo. Gene, stop. Gene. Ah! Ah! Oh, it's done. I'm grabbing my amp. Maybe it won't be so bad.  I'm a bad man with a master plan  And the ladies call me Tex  And the one thing all the ladies know is  I'm good at having...  (grunts rapidly)  s*x, s*x, s*x, s*x, s*x, s*x, s*x  I leave my shirt on, that's okay  Don't make me feel self-conscious, babe  s*x, s*x, s*x, s*x, s*x, when you're done, say that was fun  We might've made a little son, I'm good at s*x  You're bad at s*x, I'm good at s*x, you're bad at s*x  I'm good at s*x, you're bad at s*x  I'm good at s*x, you're bad at s*x, I'm good at s*x...  (Tommy continues singing) Oh, my God. (quietly): Tommy's music is terrible. He's driving out all the customers. You told him he could play here all week? (quietly): I don't think I did. I did. But this is still way better than dealing with Hugo. You got to say something. What about that song, "Elderly Prostitute"?  Da, da, da, da, da, elderly prostitute  Da, da, da, boo, ba, elderly prostitute...  All right, I'll say something. So, what'd you guys think? Did you like my rock? D'oh. Tommy, that, uh... rocked. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Linda, what'd you think? Ha! Did it speak to you as a lady? Now be honest. It screamed in my face as a lady. Oh, Mom loved it. Sell her a CD. Done. Yeah, listen, Tommy, can I talk to you about something I... Come on, let's go backstage. Let's go. What? Oh. Okay. (door bell jangles) Hmm! WhooMan. What people don't know about rock, it's a very physical... experience, you know? It's-it's very athletic. You're moving around a lot. Yeah, yeah. You noticed that. It's almost like you moved around too much. Yeah, I've gotten all kinds of comments, you know... "you move around a lot," "you seem to be having a hard time." Yeah, I can see that one, a little bit. "You're jumping around for no reason." Right. "You know, your eyes are bulging weird. It's off-putting," this and that... but that's what they said about Queen. Yeah. Did they? Uh, in rock in general. Hey, uh, Tommy, uh... you know, our place is sort of a family restaurant and... some of your songs are a little risqué. So I was thinking, maybe don't... Wait. Hold on a second. Before I forget, I got a little something here for you... it's your inspection file. There's nothing on here. That's right! Clean slate. You're welcome. Wow. Really? Yeah, come on, shut up. Well, thanks, Tommy. Oh, man. I still got all that mojo flowing through me. You know, I-I got to get it out. I'm gonna take this van to the beach and peel off some burnies. You want to come? Um... what's a... wh-what's a burny? (tires screeching, Tommy laughing) (laughing) Ah! Ah, I'm gonna throw up! I want to go home! What? This is fun! Oh, no more burnies! All right, people, line up! You'll see we have many noteworthy specimens on the beach today. Only a dollar to get a closer look at the action. Step right up! Look through this tube, see some boob. Give me the green, see some peen. Hey, this is gross. We came all this way to see old people? Ew! Nasty! You tricked us. I want my money back. Uh-oh. Whoa-whoa, wait, whoa-ho-ho, you guys, you're looking at this the wrong way. You want to see nice bodies?! Get a magazine! This is real, people! Check out that guy. What is that? Is that a liver spot? Is that a birthmark? Is that a third nipple? Who knows? You can't write this crap! Hold up, hold up, hold up. Let me see. I get it. Yeah, I guess, on second look, it's better. This, uh... first song goes pretty deep. It's called "Daddy." Uh... at least it's, uh, uh, a family song.  Daddy! You abandoned me!  Daddy! You sold drugs to me!  Punches are not hugs to me!  Eh. It's no "Elderly Prostitute." Bobby, you said you talked to him. Uh, I did, kinda. But then he wiped our record clean.  Daddy! You're my enemy!  (sobbing)  You are my enemy! My enemy!  Both:  You are my enemy! My enemy!  My enemy!  No, don't. It's just me, just me, just me.  My enemy!  Oh, sorry.  You, you, you!  The ltsy-Bitsy Stripper climbed up the brassy pole  Down came her legs and wrapped around my soul  Weave your web of your sexy web  Weave your sexy web around me  Weave your web, weave your naughty web  Around my body, my beautiful body  My beautiful legs, my beautiful torso  Weave that web around me...    Gene: Hurdles on a beach? What are those silly little skin bags up to now? Wait a second. This can't be. Ow! Uh, guys, you might want to buy seats now, for tomorrow's event. Zeke: "Nudecathlon." That sounds like decathlon, but nude. They're naked and old and they're bringing home the gold! Go! You go talk to him! All right. Tommy, listen, there's something I need to talk to you about. I was thinking, maybe, um... you could take some time off from performing... uh, here. What? What, what are talking about, Bobby boy? It's just that, um... you know, you could be performing at... at way different places. Huh, it's almost like you're saying you don't want me to play here anymore. No. Not... No. You... took that the wrong way. Uh-huh. What I meant was... you're great. Right. Um, but just not maybe for, for here. I'll tell you what's funny, you know, that's what the manager over at Pistol McSwish's said, too. Did he? Yeah, kind of exactly. Oh. And it's a shame about that guy... you know, he got shut down by me. What are you doing? You know, I hate to say this, but, you know, you got rat turds on your floor, man, and, yeah, I-I gotta write that up, unfortunately. What? Tommy, that's crazy. You just carry around bags of rat turds in your pocket? Yeah, I don't know what you're talking about. Yeah, look over... see, I see some more right over here, see? You didn't even empty that one! You're saying a rat just came in here and tossed a bag of its poop on my floor? Yeah, that's a thing that happens. And look, you know, it can all go away. Just let me do an encore, and then come back and play every night. No, Tommy! You're not gonna hold us hostage with your crappy music and your threats! Crappy?! So get out of my restaurant, Tommy! Okay! Of course, you know what this means: Until further notice, you are shut down, my man! Fine! Why don't you get out, my man?! Oh, gladly, my man! Oh, and guess what?! You do have bulging eyes! And it is off-putting! So, uh... h-how did, uh, how'd it go? Great. We're hungry, Bobby! Open up! I can't, Teddy. Tommy closed us down. If I serve you, I could go to jail. We're willing to take that chance! If Tommy doesn't let us open, we'll be broke by next week! We gotta fix this, Bobby! There's only one person who can help us now. Oh, God. Oh, don't be so nervous. It's natural. What's going on here, anyway? Naked field day! Fun! Ugh. Bubbila, bubbila. There he is. I can't believe I'm gonna grovel to a naked Hugo. Bob! Linda! You're just in time to see me excel at nude tetherball! Hugo, look, I've come to ask for your help. The guy who replaced you shut down the restaurant. Oh, Bob, that's a pity. But the health-inspecting world doesn't interest me anymore. Come on. This guy's nuts, Hugo. He, he planted rat poop. You wouldn't even do that. Listen to you, Bob! It's all about things with you! Restaurants! Rat feces! Underwear! Oh, God. Today is the Nudecathlon, so either you join me in nude brotherhood or kindly return to your clothed country. All right, all right. What, what if I did join you? The more the merrier. But what if I competed and beat you? (chuckles) Uh, you won't. But if I did, would you help us out then? Is this some kind of bet, Bob? Yeah. It's a bet. And what do, what do I get if I win? Well, what do you want? You have to cater the Nudecathlon closing ceremony for free. If this is what it takes, this is what it takes. Bob, you do realize what you're getting yourself into. A nudecathlon has 27 events, not including warm-up freeze tag. I quit. No, Bobby, come on! You can do it! (groans) Parlays, exactas, trifectas! We're taking all action, people! Louise, you're gonna want to see this. (wailing groan) (screams) We played with fire, and this is what we get... fire in our eyes! I think Dad looks pretty good, considering he's had three kids. Hey, Dad, stop stretching like that! Oh, my God! (blows whistle) Zeke here, calling the action for you on this sunny afternoon. There can only be one winner today, but many floppy wieners. And they're off! Doughboy's out to an early lead! (panting) Go, Bobby, go!  History repeats itself, try, and you'll succeed...  You've got a tough day ahead of you, Bob.  And you can have your dream  You're the best around Ooh!  Like sand through his hourglass!  You're the best around  Nothing's ever gonna keep you down  You're the best around...  Point: Hugo.  Nothing's ever gonna keep you down...  Big fatty wins the tug! Bad luck, little fatty! Three legs, four thighs and two ding-dongs. Now that's one nasty bucket of chicken! (blows whistle)  Try your best to win them all  And one day, time will tell  When you're the best that's standing there  You'll reach the final bell  I'm the best around  Nothing's gonna ever keep me down  I'm the best around...  How are we holding up, Bob? Fine! Just great! Well, I must say you've proven yourself a worthy naked adversary. But this last event is for all the marbles. Don't say marbles. Line up for Greco-Roman wrestling! Go, Bobby! You're my big naked knight! I'm dying. Gentlemen, enter the ring. May the best nude win. May the best nude win. (blows whistle) (both grunting) Ah, not there. There you go. (grunts) Take this one. Let go! Sweep the leg, Dad! Sweep the leg! Treat him like a naked piñata, Dad! Break him open for some candy! Okay, Bob, time to do this! Not today, Bob! Oh! The little guy flips the fay little a patty! We've got a pin! No! Yes! I win! You took Linda from me, you were the scourge of my professional life, but this time, I win! (laughing wildly) You can get off me now, Hugo! Never! (laughing): I win! Let's go home, Lin. All right. I win, win, win! Wow. That was rough. Naked and defeated. Just the way he entered this world. Bobby, you put your pants on backwards, honey. Doesn't matter. None of it matters. We lost the restaurant, Lin. Tina, let's put our pants on backwards, too. Let's do it for Dad! I'm wearing a skirt, but okay. (door bell jangles) Hugo? What are you doing here? And why are you wearing clothes? Or is that just body paint? Today, at the beach, you tasted my sweet victory, but I realized something: It wasn't enough. What does that mean? I want to shut you down... I do... not some dirty doody-dropper... me. Until then, you're open for business. Ron? You got it, buddy. All right! Well, thanks, Hugo. All right, everyone! Load in! What's going on? The closing ceremony, Bob. Remember? You have to cater it. Disrobe at will! Don't bother with courtesy tissues on the seats. Gettin' nude for food! I love it! Hold the buns. Am I right?! Well, better clean up the gum under the tables. I'll get to it. Tina, no. I hate you, Hugo. (cackles) Wait... what about Tommy Jaronda? How we doin', Jimmy Pesto's?  I'm a bad man with a master plan  And the ladies call me Tex  And the one thing all the ladies know is  I'm good at having  Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh, sex-sex-sex-sex-sex  I'm good at s*x, I'm good at s*x  I'm very, very, very, very good at s*x  I am good, you are good, too  You're learning, little by little  I'm guiding you with my hand and my arms  I'm good at s*x, you're learning quick... 
Lookie, lookie. My green blazer from when I had jury duty on Saint Patrick's Day. What's the blazer for? Tina's gonna wear it at her audition tomorrow for the school news channel. I want to be serious newswoman, like Holly Hunter in Broadcast News. "It must be great being right all the time. No, it's terrible." Aw. I need to practice being a television journalist. Dad, can I interview you? Um, okay. Don't look directly into the camera, Dad. I got it. So, tell me, why burgers? Well, my dad got me started... Do you see this as a stepping stone to a real restaurant? It... is a real restaurant. Mm, slop shop. Can you cook anything other than burgers? Yes, lots of things. Like? Like, um... like, paella. Paella... tell me how you make that. Well, I'd have to look up the recipe, but, uh... So you don't know how to make paella? No, I could make... Okay, I'm confused, because a minute ago you were an expert. Dad needs media coaching. Look, I randomly said "paella." I didn't mean to. Ah, I'm going in tight. Bob, get off paella. All right, interview's over. Get that camera out of my face. I think we got what we need. You look amazing, sweetie. And you're gonna look even better on camera. You inherited my strong chin. Where's your strong chin, Mom? I can't see it. Keep looking, you'll find it. What did I inherit from you, Mom? You got my zest for life. And my extra long pinky toe. And I got your birthing hips. Actually, Gene, you take more after your father. No, hips don't lie. Look at this. I forgot that I went through a Judd Nelson phase. That's your father when he was your age. He looked just like you. (groans) Wait, does that mean when I'm his age, I'm gonna look just like him? Spoiler alert! No! Hey, you could do worse. I don't see how! At least you know your shoulders won't go bald. Gene, it's starting. I found this on your pillow! Ah! Oh, my God! Quick, come me over! Trump me! Louise... What? You're not going bald, Gene. Apologize, Louise. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. (scissors snipping) It's okay. What's the point of clinging to this, if I'm doomed to be that? Huh. I don't know. Lin. Why wait? Let's do it now. I want the whole Bob. Male-pattern baldness. Hmm. Stoop shoulders. Stop. Paunch. Please. And the push broom on my lip. This is incredibly insulting. Think about how I feel. You really let myself go. Go to school. We're going. Bye. Remember, kids, this is just the student news, no pressure. I'll only be going back frame by frame and critiquing you on eye contact, presentation and how cool you are. You really want to do this? (sighs) Okay, first up to the green screen, Zeke with sports. Comin' at ya, Mr. Grant! That game was tighter than a tater in a tailpipe. It was like two babies climbin' on the same boob. Then we lost. Wow, Zeke, I feel like I was there. Next up, auditioning for field reporters, Andy and Ollie. Back to you, Andy. Back to you, Ollie. Back to you, Andy. Back to you, Ollie. If only you two were Siamese twins. We can do that. Oh, great! (grunting) That'd be super helpful if you could figure that out. It looks like it's working. We did it! So sweet. And, next up, for the coveted anchor spot, Tammy. Good luck, Tammy. Uh, I was born lucky, Tina. 'Cause I was born me and not you. And I'm a blonde now, so I'm better than you. (scoffs) I don't like what you say, but I admire the way you say it. Wow, it's Tammy with the news! Whoo!  News... News. Tam, slam, thank you, ma'am. Next up, Tina. Oh, hey, Tina, little tip: You're a super fast talker, so talk really slow. Thanks, Tammy. Whoa! That's still way too fast. Mr. Grant, I'm here because I have a nose for news. Great. Now about that green jacket... I'm Tina with... (whispers): Tina. ... with... the... (screams) Paranormal activity! (screams) Oh, my God, I'm anchor! Yes! Yes!  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  (sings guitar riff) Whoo! I am anchor! I'm staff intern? But I already had a sign-off. "Good-bye, audience." Well, maybe you could change it to "Does anyone need juice?" Does anyone need juice? Hmm. Maybe it'll work better when you have some juice. So, what does the staff intern do? Besides go on juice box runs? Yeah. Oh, lots of things. You know, hand out the juice, make sure people are happy with their juice, clean up all the empty juice boxes. Okay. Isn't there any other important behind-the-scenes stuff I could do to help? Well, there's editing music, effects. That stuff is a blast. Great. But I do those. I mean, if you did them, what would I do? Be the teacher? Yeah, right, Tina, that sounds great. I'll just teach. (sighs) Little more off the top. Sprinkle on the back and the ears. A little more glue.  Buh, buh, buh, buh Show me, show me!  VoilÃ ! It's perfect! I've been tarred and Bobbed. I don't know how I got that arm hair to look so sad, but I did it. Can I get in here? I need to... Oh, my God! It's like looking in a mirror! No, it isn't, Gene. Who's Gene? I already can't tell who's who. Take that stuff off. Lin, get in here and settle this! Don't call your mother Lin. What? Oh! Wha... h-hey! Whoa, travel-size Bob. Aw. Linda, you're encouraging him. I need the bathroom. Oh. Wow, this is confusing. No, it's not. You're my family and I love you, but you're terrible. You're all terrible. I don't say that. Well, that's all you say. You do. You kind of do. Bob and Gene: Unbelievable. Gene. Bob. All right, enough. Enough. I'm not doing this. Yes, you are. No, I'm... oh, my God. Oh, God. He's really good. He's good. He's not good, Lin. He's not good, Lin. He's good. Gene! What, Bob?! Lin! Lin! What? Gene! Lin! Lin! Gene! I'm leaving! Aw, he's so cute. Stop following me! Stop following me in front! Hi, Mr. Branca. Careful, Tina. Slippery. (gasps) Did Mrs. Persky's water break? I may have won the baby pool. Worse. Someone dragged in a dog turd. And this isn't the first time, either. You have great stories, Mr. Branca. I ever tell you you're, like, my best friend? Oh. Thank you. Look, this news show competes for students' attention with cell phones, gossip and bathroom graffiti. We need to be faster, meaner, and graffiti-er! So, what I'm... I have a cran-apple, two grapes and a bunch of kiwi-strawberry. Here's the crazy straw you asked for, Zeke. Extra crazy, just how you like it. Could be crazier. Now, who knows the five W's of school news? Oh, "who, what, where, when and sometimes why." Or, is that vowels? No! They're "wow, woo-hoo, way hot, weird and what the mmm." Every story we do should have all five. I got one: New kid nip slips! Way hot, Zeke! Oh, whose parents are poor? Woo-hoo, Tammy! I've got one. The custodian says someone is tracking in dog poo. What the huh? Less caca, more gaga, Tina. Anyone else? I hear there's a 45-year-old fourth grader with a mustache walking around school. Now that's pretty "what the ah"! Go with that. Zeke: This is WSN, the news you need from the students you like. In your face! I'm Tammy Larson and these are the breaking stories. What's up with Brenda? I mean, right? Jimmy Pesto Junior previews dance moves the principal won't allow at winter prom. This one's out. Can't do this. Forget about this one. (grunts) I love it, but it's not news. Now, to our top story: Lenny Destefano... is there enough of him to go around, and how can we ration our passion? Jocelyn, who's Lenny going to the winter prom with? No one knows. He's going out with Julie, but he's been texting the entire drill team and me. And me, also. Jocelyn: Oh. Now to Zeke with dodgeball highlights. Thanks, Tammy! Here's a kid getting it in the muchachos. Ooh! Here's another dude, right in the Easter eggs. Boing! Watch this geezer with a 'stache get his. (grunts) It's okay, I've had my kids. Hey, Tina, I saw the news. Is that true about Lenny and the drill team? Julie deserves better. The school deserves better news. Well, I just got back from the library. More shoe poopy got dragged in up there. All the way to the reference section. Talk about Encyclopedia Brown. (laughs) I... I don't get it. Wait, that's a pretty long way to track something in on a shoe. I'm gonna poke around. Something doesn't smell right. That's this. Oh, yeah. So it is applesauce, but try to find it in the sauce aisle at the supermarket. You'll be sorely disappointed. Anyway, I was looking for chutney. Uh, is this a long story, Teddy? I mean, it has been long, but is it longer? I haven't gotten to the story part yet. Gene, I need you behind the counter. Just stand here and I'll be right back. I'm not sure I appreciate being foisted off like this, Bob. So, anyway, I end up in the ethnic food section. Mm-hmm. It was like a whole new world opened up. Mm-hmm. I bought baby food from lndia. Those babies are tough. No joke on those slices. That's fascinating, Teddy. Little Bob is great. Yeah, I guess I'll keep him. (laughs) Lin, stop. You stop. No, stop, Lin. No, you stop, little Bobby. Mm-hmm, stop. Bobby, stop. Look at you two, you're like an old married couple. We put up with each other. All right, enough, Gene. Gene, get back to the kitchen. How could dog poop make it all the way up two flights of stairs and into the library on a shoe without being wiped off? Tele-poop-tation? Let's experiment. We need something the exact same size and texture as poop. How about Dad's burger? It's even the same color! Great idea. (both making fart noises) What the hell are you kids doing? Walking on one of Dad's burgers to see how much like dog doo it is. Oh, science. It's clean. That can mean only one thing: The poos must have come from inside the school. Which means, they're probably human! I knew there was a story there. We're looking at a serial pooper. Oh, my God. Is it you, Louise? I've dabbled in the area, but I don't get enough food to be a serial pooper. I, uh, probably only poop once a week. I think I'll call the culprit the Mad Pooper. Ooh, I got a better one. The Butt-ler. Get it? I get it. It's got "butt" in it. (laughs, makes fart noise) Butt. Whatever we call him or her, it's definitely news. Mr. Grant: That's toilet journalism, Tina. We do gutter journalism. But there's a Mad Pooper loose in the school. It's the job of the news to inform the public. It's worth it, even if we save just one shoe. Yuck. Well said, Tammy. (sighs) The Mad Pooper story is ten times bigger than Lenny Destefano's love life. And less disgusting. He'll put his lips on anything with pom-poms. But I can't get it out there. WSN has a news monopoly. So do your own newscast. My own newscast? You think I could do that? Who's the one yammering about her nose for news? Me? Yeah, this nose right here! Ow! Get it sniffing! Snort some news up there! I can't snort 'cause you're holding my nose. There's gonna be lots of things holding you back! Okay. Snort it up! Come on, Cronkite, snort! It's for the good of the people! Let me know when you got something. (girl screams) My diorama... got diarrheaed. I think I just snorted a story. Dad's old camcorder, a VCR and a videotape? Say hello to your state-of-the-art studio. But, this is Gene's birth. There's a lot of crowning stuff that can just be taped over. Looks like an angry softball trying to get out of a coin purse. Hmm, okay. Listen, princess, I don't even know what you're talking about, but you can do anything you set your mind to. And, no matter what, your mother and I will always love you. He's good. That kid just fathered the crap out of you. He did... okay. I did great. Little preachy. You got a lot of shine on you, Tina. (coughing) How did you get equal time on the school network? I told Principal Spoors I had incriminating pictures of him. Because I drew some incriminating pictures of him. Great, let's do this. These halls are calm now. But on Wednesday, it was a different story. I left my shoebox diorama for a minute and someone pooped in it. It was about the Industrial Revolution. (crying) Some call him the Mad Pooper. My mom calls him the Butt-ler. By any name, these brown thumbtacks tell a tale of terror. Excuse me, can I go get my medicine at the nurse's office? Shh. I'm watching this. Oh. Oh, no. Who would do such a thing? We turn to an expert, Mr. Frond. It's someone trying to communicate. Likely, a foreign- exchange student. He or she has something inside them they desperately want to get out. Rage? Poo. And what do Wagstaff students think? My message to the Mad Pooper is: Grow up! I did. Whoever the Mad Pooper is, he or she is probably not finished. And if they're not, I'm not. In the hall, I'm Tina Belcher. Louise: And we're clear. Yes, I did it. Take that, Tammy. And Holly Hunter. Louise: I lied, we're not clear. Okay, now we're clear. I'll just edit that part out. Oh, okay, good.    (blowing air) (dull splat) Ah, damn it, we got poop-scooped! Tina's story is all anyone's talking about. Tammy, what happened? Well, you said gaga, not caca. This caca is gaga! Now get me that story. I don't know how. Do it, or I'll replace you with the weird twins. Back to you, Andy! Back to you, Ollie! Whoa, okay, no, no, no! Forget it. Hey, Tina, great Mad Pooper reporting. Thanks. Can I copy you like I do in math class? Real news isn't about copying. And you shouldn't copy me in math. Yeah, well, you should get a tutor, 'cause I got a "C." You got a "C"? Wait, I got a "D." You know what? I'll do my own story. And it'll be way better than yours, you lame-pon. Good, I hope it is. It will be. Because then we'll have more information about the Mad Pooper... Tina, we're trash-talking; Stop turning it into a normal conversation. Oh. Sorry. Um, skank? That's much better! Uh, I hate your new hair color. Give it to me! Your eye shadow is a little much. In the face! My face! Our top story: Is Tina the Mad Pooper? What if actual surveillance footage existed showing Tina in the act? Let's go to a reenactment of what that footage might look like. She was always so quiet. Yeah, she kept to herself. Yeah, she did. She did. So, did Tina create the very story she reported on? Mr. Grant is here to comment. When Tina auditioned, frankly, I was physically afraid of her ambition. She would've done anything to get on TV. And now, apparently, she has. Ah. And what if WSN had an exclusive video confession? Me... Tina... are... Mad... Pooper. You don't believe that just because it was on TV, right? Got it. Tina? Principal's office, now. (kids gasping, murmuring) I didn't do it. Follow the money. I'll take a poop detector test. Poop on me once, shame on you. Poop on me twice, we're not best friends anymore! It's not me, it was a reenactment. If it didn't happen, then how could they reenact it? Huh. Uh, yeah. Oh, you should be a teacher instead of secretary, Ms. Schnur. I know. Louise, why are you here? Tammy didn't frame you. Unrelated charge. And now we wait. At least you're guilty of something. I got framed. Cry to Principal Spoors when he gets back from the anti-smoking assembly. (gasps) Oh, my God, the assembly! The whole school is there. Can you think of a better place for the Mad Pooper to strike? The Super Bowl, American ldol, Westminster Dog Show, upside-down roller coaster, International Space Station, yoga retreat, inside a T-shirt g*n... If I could just get out of here, I could clear my name. I'll take care of Ms. Schnur. Oh, no, look, they're towing a high-mileage, smallish car with a bumper sticker about a personal passion maybe? "My other car's a cat"? That's the one! No! I hope Ms. Schnur's car's okay. Go, Tina! Oh, yeah. All right, missy, this better be good. Louise, where's your sister? Tina's not here, Gene. Don't you sass me! Hey, I don't even let Dad talk to me like that. (panting): We got here as soon as we could. Gene, what are you doing here? They called me! No, they called me. I can't believe my daughter is the Butt-ler. I have no daughter! Oh, don't say that, Gene. Yes, he should say that. Come on, she's down at the assembly trying to clear her name. (sighs) Our lives were so much simpler before the rug rats. We use to see movies... Lin! Sorry, but it's true. (applause) Cigarettes are the real devil sticks. Nicotine is a bad scene. You're here somewhere, Mad Pooper. Let's stay focused; We got to find Tin... Ooh, jugglers! Hey, can I get a light? Sure, smoke 'em if you got 'em. This is kind of a weird message. I really want a cigarette. I really want to juggle. No sign? Nothing. Oh, my God, look. The Pooper. I need to get up there. But how? You could use that hydraulic scissor lift. Perfect. I'll sneak up on him. I'll be as quiet as a mouse. Kelly Mathis and Jocelyn are wearing the same scrunchie. But Jocelyn is definitely wearing it better. Mr. Grant, look. It's Tina. What's she doing up there? Maybe she is the Mad Pooper. Hey, we're better than we thought. Let's get that camera. Yeah, catch her in the act. On the big screen! That's a big load of news. Look, everyone! It's the Mad Pooper! (screams) Ah, it's Tina! Tina, what are you doing? Get down! (crowd gasps) Oh, my God! Come out of the shadows, Mad Pooper. (crowd gasps) Zeke? Surprised? Zeke's the Butt-ler! Why'd you do it, Zeke? Well, the first time was an accident. But the second time was for fun. Then accident, fun, fun, another accident, three funs in a row, then after that, I was doing it for you, Tina. Aw. Aw. But now it's over. It's not over. I got one left! Zeke, no. (chanting): Poop! Poop! Poop! Crowd (chanting): Poop! Poop! Poop! Poop! Poop! Stupid kids, listen to them. Poop's not funny. I mean, it is a little, but what sort of message are we... I can't stand it! I want to see him poop! I want to be a kid again! Poop! Poop! Poop! Oh, thank God. He's back. Aw, I'll miss my Muppet Baby Bobby. You don't have to do this. Poop! Poop! Poop! Poop! Here we go. (grunts) This isn't an accident! No, it is, it is. (grunting): Oh, God. Oh, boy. It's taking a long time. It's a girl! Uh, no, it's a boy! I guess we're really watching this. Bobby, hold my hand. Get out of there! No! (sighs) Tammy, look out! (slow-motion): No...! Our top story: The Mad Pooper almost nails me. I'm joined by the girl who saved my hair. Louise, it was so close. I thought it was going to be a lot closer, Tammy, to be honest. But I miscalculated. Wind, maybe. I was scared there was gonna be poop right into my mouth. Let's go to the Mad Pooper himself, Zeke, who, incredibly, is not in trouble. Let's find out why. My family moves around a lot. His family moves around a lot. Uh, WSN would like to apologize for any inadvertent suggestion that Tina Belcher was the Mad Pooper. Our bad. And now, a new WSN feature: The Tina Table. Is it getting hot in here? One study shows the school nurse's thermometer is off by one degree. She's here to discuss it. Later, I'll talk to students about trading snacks at lunch. Is it insider trading? No, it isn't. Look at my news girl, her pretty head floating like a balloon. Is it just me, or does Tina look great without a torso? Wonder how'd she look with a mustache and a bald spot? Oh, I just remembered how to make paella.
(thunder rumbling) Linda: Happy Valentine's Day to all my loves. Smooches. Everyone gets a smooch. (kissing sounds) Oh, give Gene mine. I'll take it. (kissing sounds) I hope a certain wife is ready to be romanced. Huh? Oh. Oh, Bobby. A pancake shaped like a heart. Wow. We got the rejects. Mine looks like a moustache. Pancake rides, five cents. I can't see what mine looks like, but it feels ear-shaped maybe? What you doing under the table, you silly? Hiding. I-I mean I'm not here so I can't go to school. But it's Valentine's Day. You love Valentine's Day. Until the St. Valentine's Day disaster last year. What? I'm talking about Jimmy Jr.'s Valentine card. Here, Tina. "From"? No...! My heart was m*rder*d by the word "from." No one says "I from you." I'm not going to school today. If Tina's not going, I'm not going. Scoot over. Yeah, we made a pact. Everybody out from under there. You're all going to school. Gene: No. Yes. There's a lot of learning to do down here. What's under there? Wouldn't you like to know? Come on, it's raining, I'll give you a ride.  Buckle it up, buckle it up  Buckle it up or you'll die.  So? I'd say I knocked it out of the park with your mother this year. Mm, more like a swing and a miss. Heart-shaped pancakes is just as bad as a "from." No, it isn't. You do the same thing every year, Dad. You need to mix it up. Yeah. What? I mix it up. I mean, I stick to a central theme, hearts, but your mom loves them. Yeah, she never gets tired of them. Huh? Mmm... Huh? Oh... Well? Mm... (groans) Hmm. Grow up, Dad. Only kids get to make homemade gifts. She deserves something nice this year. Mom's a real keeper. She's okay. Teddy: So, Lin, did Bob make another last-minute heart-shaped thing this year? Flapjacks. Oh. Oh. Ah, it's all right. Valentine's Day isn't about valentines. It's about two people being in love.  Two people  Together forever  Security in life  And someone to love ya  Instead of being all alone  Such a lonely existence  I'd k*ll myself.  Tough song. It's talking about us, Mort. Oh, my God, I'm sorry. Going on about love when you guys don't... Have any love... in the slightest? I just got a great idea. I'm gonna find love for both of you today. We are gonna do speed dating. All right. I could go for that. I'm in. I'll make a sign. Oh, this is gonna be fun. Bob: Okay, so what do you think your mom wants-- chocolates? Perfume? We don't think what Mom wants. We know what Mom wants. Great, what does she want? A Grazielda figurine. Oh, yeah, those porcelain thingies. Okay, I'll-I'll get one of those. Thanks. All right, have a good day, kids. Dad, there are hundreds of Grazieldas, thousands maybe. Taking our jobs, marrying our women. Only we know the exact one Mom wants. Yeah, if you pick the wrong one, it's like you got her nothing! Okay, so tell me-- which one is it? We'll tell you... at the mall. Yeah, we should go to the mall. My heart will be safe from Jimmy Jr. there. Hey, I'm not taking you out of school to go to the mall. Okay, well, you know, it's your marriage. (knock on window) You're holding up the line. Hold on, one minute. Hmm, I could stand to wow her. (horns honking) Then wow the woman. Stop, I'm... wait! Come on, move it! You move it! I'm saying good-bye to my kids! (groans) You're sure you know? I know. All right, we're going to the mall then! (whoops) To the mall! Yeah! Okay. Eat it, you losers!  Buckle it up, buckle it up  Buckle it up or you'll die.  Okay, we go in, you tell me which one to buy, I get you back to school by 10:00, and you can tell your teachers, um, you had, uh... A dyslexic episode! Pregnancy. Bob: Hmm. Shingles. Uh, yeah, that's good, fine. Bob: Wow, these are all so corny. Louise: What's so corny about a puppy under an umbrella? (Bob groans) All right, so which one does your mom want? That one! That one! That one? That one. Wait a second, you have no clue which one your mom wants-- you just tricked me to get out of school. How dare you! I believed them, too, Dad. Egg on our face, huh? Let me guess-- looking for a Grazielda for your lovely wife? Yeah, so which one is the least expensive? Oh, this is kind of our starter figurine-- La Princessa. She's $250. What? That's your cheapest? I don't like that word. Perhaps you nor your wife are really serious about Grazieldas. No, we're not. Who would be serious about these things? Bill Belichick, Peter Frampton, Linda Lavin to name a few. Kids, we're leaving. Linda: Welcome, ladies, to Bob's Burgers' Speed Dating. You'll have one minute with these fine gentlemen, and when you hear this-- Kank-kank-- switch partners. But if you hear this-- cra-cra-crank-- change topics. And who's ready to fall in love? (watch beeps) Speed date. So, Teddy, this is Gina. You two are now in pre-love. We are? Well, you got 60 seconds to figure it out. So, ticktock, let's go. Uh, I'm Teddy, like Linda said earlier. Um, what do we talk about? Uh, I don't know. What do we talk about? I want to lick this one like an envelope, mmm. Great, mail jokes. (laughs) Oh, you're a mailman. Kids, how about this cell phone cover? It says, "Got Milf." That's perfect, right? For your mom? I'll get this and then I'll bring you kids back to school. School? Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Dad, you need to wow her. This is not gonna wow her. I thought you were done half-assing it, Dad. Why can't you be more romantic? What? I'm plenty romantic. Very funny. Stop goofing. What was the most romantic thing you ever did for Mom? I don't know, I planned stuff. I planned a whole romantic day one time. It was her birthday... No, wait, it was my birthday... No, no, no, wait, it was Valentine's Day. It was our first Valentine's Day together. Gene: You are the worst storyteller. Where's Maya Angelou when you need him? Bob: Yeah, I made a picnic basket and I picked out a spot to watch the sunset, and then my car died. So we had to get towed to the mechanic's. Tell me exactly what was wrong with the car-- was it a gasket? Was it the carburetor? Tina: Guys, he's telling us a romantic story. Bob: While the car was getting fixed, we went to a bar across the street. It wasn't the beach at sunset, but we, uh, we had a great time. Tina: Aw. And there was this old beat-up machine, like a love tester or something, and we squeezed the lever together, and it said we were "red hot." And she kissed me and that's, uh, that's when I knew we were in love. That's it. Buy Mom the love tester. What do you mean, the actual machine? Yeah, she'd totally marry you if you did that. Dad, do you remember where that bar is? Will it take all day to find it? Hmm, I do think I remember where it is. Oh, really? We've got a mission. The most noble mission there is-- a love mission. It's a missionary position mission. Yeah, she'd really like that. Probably get it for, like, 50 bucks, tops. All right, I'll drop you off at school and then I'll go to the dive bar. That's crazy. School is way out of the way. They're doing construction on that one street, it's raining-- what a clusterjam. We should go with you, Dad. All right, you can come, but then right back to... Uh-uh-uh, not another word about school. To the dive bar! Next dating game... speed hand holding. (watch beeps) And... hold hands. Kank-kank! (grunting) Teddy, Teddy, you're gonna hurt her. You're not trying to crush her. What? I don't mind it rough. Very good, Mort. You are as limp as can be. Limp and clammy, my signature hold. (door opens, bell jingles) Sergeant Bosco! What are you doing here? Someone just robbed a jewelry store on Front Street. He fled on foot in this direction so we're going door-to-door. Oh. All we know is he's five-ten to six-feet tall with an athletic build. Eh, none of you guys fit that description. Wow, that's harsh. Hey. A few years ago. Bosco, I couldn't help notice you don't have a wedding ring. Did the guy steal that, too? No, I chucked it into a ravine after my divorce went through. Oh. Officer (over radio): 500 block is negative. Well, keep looking! Damn, we had him, and then we lost him. Talking to me, Bosco? No! Maybe don't leave your thumb on the button? Eh, what's going on in here? Speed dating. Ladies, I think we've got a new contestant. No, no, if I wanted to feel like a loser, I'd just call my kids. But this is Bob's Burgers' Speed Dating. Ladies and cops eat free. All right, you got five minutes. Okay, couple up, clank-clank! How can I help you? Yeah, I was here about 15 years ago and I-I played this old timey-looking love tester thing. Do you still have it? You mean Dr. Love's Love Testometer? Yeah, that's it. He knows it. Hooray. Eh, the owner sold it a few years ago. Oh, man. Do you know who he sold it to? Nah, no clue, sorry. I know where it is. Hugo! Bob. Bob. Ron. Hugo. Yes, what? Oh. You know where the love testometer that used to be here is? I do. In fact, later today I'm inspecting the establishment where it's currently testometering. That's great. I think you should invest in new soap for your bathroom before you purchase vintage amusements. You think soap's the problem with our bathroom? But it's not for the restaurant. It's my Valentine's Day gift for Linda. Oops, I just forgot where it is. Oh, come on. I'm not helping you buy Linda a romantic Valentine's gift. Maybe you should tell him, Hugo. Maybe I don't want to hear it, Ron. All right. You're such a jerk, Hugo, you know that? There are 97 bars and restaurants in my expansive jurisdiction. Good luck finding it, Bob. (laughs) Bob (sighs): Back to the mall, I guess. Don't take this lying down, Dad. But Hugo won't tell us where the testometer is. He said he's inspecting the place today. So, okay, so what day is it? It's today. Right. So you have to follow him. Yes! It's Valentine's Day, damn it. You're right. He'll lead us right to the love testometer. Let's ride. Hyah! (whoops) But let's get a hot chocolate or something first. It's all rainy out. Great idea, Eugene. Whoo-hoo. Mm-hmm. Tina (groaning): You're too close! He'll see us. I know what I'm doing. I've got a buffer car. You're gonna lead us right to the testometer. And... we lost him. We didn't lose him, we'll catch up. I can still see him. Gene: Look, he's turning. No, no, no, don't turn. All right, uh... Let's see if I can safely go through this red light. We're losing him. Drive! It's safe! It's safe! (horn blaring) Bob: Oh, sorry. Sorr... I'll go. (car horn beeps) I'll go... Stop! (truck horn blares) Okay! (horns honking) I'm... I'm in the FBI. It's, uh, uh... it's official business! S-Sorry. (horns honking) Kank-kank. All right, new game. Everyone say your favorite food. (watch beeps) Go. Soy sauce. Wax lips? Plain white rice. Fried green tomatoes. Favorite love-making position. Go! The Fried Green Tomato. The Pick n' Roll. The Broken Sprinkler. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. The Sticky Wicket. No, no, no. Getting people to say their favorite things isn't gonna work. Sure it is. If you like the same food or s*x angles, you're compatible. I'd do the exact opposite. I'd make everyone say the worst thing about themselves, the most embarrassing, darkest secret. If the other person can stomach you for another second, then maybe you have a chance together, maybe. What? That is the least romantic... I want to do it. Let's do it. I'm game. No. I'll go first. Hi there. I'm part of a secret society. We hunt men for sport. Hello. I've had a yeast infection for ten years. Stop. Oh, Gina, no. (gags) Sometimes I just put the mail down the storm drain. I knew it. I knew it. Yeah, there you go. I called in a b*mb threat once 'cause I heard Mark Harmon was staying at this hotel. I wanted to see him evacuate, and then I stalked him for a year and hit his wife with my car. No, stop it. Saying icky stuff about yourselves isn't what Valentine's Day is about. Now, stop it. Well, it's what love's about. And if you women can handle my baggage, then you can fly with me, but bring a sick bag, 'cause it's gonna be a real bumpy ride. Clean-up, aisle my panties. No. Psst, over here. Huh? Hey, do you have a coin-operated machine in there that predicts love? Can't I just take out the trash one time without getting hit on by some perv? He may be a perv, but that's my dad. Hugo's gonna take forever. We wouldn't have to wait for Hugo to lead us to the next place if we found out where he's going. It's locked. But the window's open a crack. Maybe we can find a hanger or... Hangers are for Sunday school clothes. Bring me a rock. We're not smashing the window. It'll look like the rain did it. Do it. Get that clipboard. Gene, stop. Ron: Uh, thanks. Hugo would have blamed me for that. Oh, hey. Hi, Ron. This is... Ron, what are you doing here? Hey! This not my van. We were just gonna get some ice cream from this truck here. We're just getting the clipboard. Listen, Hugo's wrong not to help you out. I don't know which place has the testometer, but, uh, this is where we're going today. Hey, thanks, Ron. You know, we'll check those places out. You're a good guy to help us. You're a great guy. I look up to you, man. Oh. I wouldn't mind having a friend like you. Okay, let's go, kids. Thanks again, Ron. See you.  Falafel  We're on a love mission  Pizza  We're on a love mission  All the rest  We're on a love mission.    Kids, uh, stay outside. Excuse me, sir, do you have something called the love testometer? I got your love testometer right here, pal. That goes in the buttbank. Gene: Yah! Yah! Hyah! Well, this is the last place on the list. It better be here. I'll have a seven and seven. No! Make it an eight and eight. Make mine a double, would you? A 16 and 16, thank you. I'm good with water. No, wait. Um, yeah, just water. Kids, please. Look, I-I've been driving all over, trying to find my wife this Valentine's gift, and you're my last hope. Everybody loves these tiny umbrellas. How many does she want? No, no, no. I'm actually looking for Dr. Love's Love Testometer. Please say you have it; I want to buy it from you. You want to buy my love testometer? You-you actually have it? Yeah, it's right over there. It's exactly as I remembered. It's beautiful. I'd love to sell it to you. Great! But I can't, I already sold it. Hello, Bob. Lookie what I just boughtie. Odd bumping into you here, Bob. Oh, wait. No, it's not. I knew you were coming, thanks to Mr. Opens-the-van-for-anyone over here. Hugo noticed the missing carbon copy from the clipboard. Nerd. Now Ron's not allowed to ride up front with me in the van. Come on, Dad, you need to get that testometer for Mom. I'm starting to disappear. How much did he pay for that? A hundred bucks for that junk. (sighs) All right. Hugo, please sell me the love testometer. Uh, no. Hugo, this isn't about me and you. This is about giving a woman a gift to make up for years of-of... Crap? Well, not quite crap, Tina. Last-minute nothings? Crap. Listen, Hugo, please sell it to me. Linda deserves it. Okay, Bob, I will sell it to you. For $500. But you only paid $100. $500? Is that thing magic? You want it or not, Bob? Of course he wants it. It's just his money's all tied up in real estate right now so... Do you take fake credit cards? All right, fine. Another thing about me, I'm hooked on pills. The bad kind that make you feel good. I like to play with a yo-yo, so something comes back to me. People, enough with the confessions. You should know that there's hardwood under this carpet. Yeah, there you go. Stop, Mort, keep that carpet on. Damn it, Sergeant Bosco. You're infecting everyone with your poison. Don't you have a jewelry store thief to catch or something? That's why I have one of these; it's called a radio. And one of these; it's called a g*n. Yeah, well, what you don't have is one of these. (imitates heartbeat) A heart. Mmm. Ugh. Pleasure doing business with you, Bob. Wow. Now you won't have to get Mom another gift for 30 years. Yup. This is the best present ever, a living memory. Your Mom and I even carved our initials on the side. See? Who's "BB"? Bob Belcher. No, who's the other "BB"? Uh, what other... Oh, God. (rock music playing) This is fun. What? Barbara Bunkley! Oh, how could I have forgotten that Valentine's Day was with Barbara Bunkley? Who is Barbara Bunkley? What was I thinking? Barbara Bunkley! Will someone please tell me who Barbara Bunkley is?! I'm guessing it's our real mom. And she's beautiful and sporty. She was my girlfriend the year before I met your mother. I can't believe that. The date I'm remembering wasn't with your mom. (laughing) What a moron! So this love mission was a sham? Hugo, I don't want it anymore. Take this stupid thing back. Oh, no, Bob, no refunds. Okay, okay, there we go. I guess we're a little short on women, huh? Yeah, yeah, work those nubs. Ooh, that's it, right there. Another hard truth about me... Oh, you stupid... I pepper-sprayed my barber, but I mean, look at this. (angry muttering) Here it goes. I dress up as Santa every night. It's the only way I can go to sleep. Uh... What, Miss ten-year yeast infection. See a doctor, why don't you? (angry muttering) I have a prison pen pal. He thinks my name is Michelle. Technically he's my fiancé. I also ran over Vinny Testaverde's wife. Oh, that's it! Everyone needs to stop listening to this cruddy duddy right now! Kank-kank-kank. Too bad, Linda, you just don't know anything about dating. Yes, I do. Then why is everyone listening to me? They're not. They are. Oh, yeah, well, without this... (gasping) Whoa! ...no one's gonna listen to you anymore, tough guy. Yeppity-do, da-da-da. Sha-ba-da-ba-bum. Uh, Lin, I don't think you can take a police officer's g*n. Sure I can. I just did. Look. No, I mean, by law. Do you have any idea what you've just done? No. Kind of. Is it bad? You're under arrest. (groans) Oof, oof, tight. Too tight. Shush. One size fits all. Shut up. What's going on? Mommy's getting arrested. What? Whoa-ho-ho, I thought Dad blew it. Yeah, well, Mommy blew it real bad here today. She blew it. Oh. What's going on is taking an officer's sidearm is a felony. Whoa, Mom, you took his g*n? She sure did, Louise. I just wanted to get control of speed dating. That does not seem like a thing you would need a g*n for. Where have you been, Bobby? We spent all day helping Dad get you the perfect Valentine's gift. All day? You kids weren't at school? Dad sprung us. I wanted to do something special for you today. We... we went all over town trying to find this thing from our first Valentine's Day together. Dad ran a red light. We went to Chinatown. And Pickles. Pickles? And I spent $500 on it, but it wasn't from our first Valentine's Day together. It was from a Valentine's Day I spent with Barbara Bunkley. I remembered it wrong. I'm so sorry, I'm... I'm an idiot. So you're telling me you let the kids play hooky to run all over town to hunt down some expensive thing you remembered from a date we didn't even go on? Yes. That... is... so romantic! Aw. Aw. What? Oh, Bobby! You went through all that trouble for me. This is the best Valentine's Day ever. Ever! (radio beeps) Give me that. So you came here for speed dating? No. A jewelry store got robbed. The suspect was spotted in the area. But you stayed for speed dating? Yeah. You must be hard up for chicks. Yup. I'm sorry I'm getting arrested on Valentine's Day. Come here. (kissing sounds) Ow. Ow. So, uh... what, I'll-I'll follow you two down to the station? Yep. This little lady is going right to... (static crackles) Shh! Shh! Wait! Shut up! Shut up! Officer (over radio): Be advised. Jewelry store suspect spotted at 15th and Grand. All right, I'm on my way. You, follow me. Well, I guess it's your lucky day. You talking to me? No, for God's sake. I'll show you how to use the radio when you get back to the station. Oh! It's so easy to call in a false tip. Those streets don't even intersect. Hi, Tina. Hi, Jimmy, Jr. You weren't at school today, so I brought you your homework. Thanks. And a Valentine's card. (groaning) Aren't you gonna open it? "Heart" not "from." Yes. So, see you at school tomorrow. I'd really "heart" that. Uh, what? I'd really "hea..." I got to get going. Yeah, me, too. So, that, uh, stuff you said earlier, that's the worst about you? Yup. That's it. Oh, except for one time... Oh, oh, oh! Don't say it. Here's my number. (shuttering moan) Hey, I made a match! I bet I screw this up. Linda: Kank-kank-kank.   Linda:  Two people  Together forever  Security in life  And someone to love ya  Instead of being all alone  Such a lonely existence   Two people  Together forever  Security in life  And someone to love ya  Instead of being all alone  Such a lonely existence  I'd k*ll myself. 
Tina, quick, Rorschach test, go. Um, Greg Kinnear from As Good as it Gets? Yes, wow. Shh, shh, I'm on the phone with the bank. Okay, so bounce the check to the power company, bounce the check to the relish guy, but make sure the beef supplier goes through. Without beef, the whole system falls apart. (laughing): Yeah, at least my bedroom beef supply is free. Yeah. Sheesh. Thanks, Marci. You're a lifesaver. I'll talk to you later, honey. God, I can't believe we're doing controlled bounces, and I can't believe you talk that way to the bank. Oh, what, with Marci? It's okay. We don't have any secrets. You know, her husband had to get recircumcised last year. The first one grew back. They don't grow back. Somehow it did. They had to have an adult "brisk"; it was freaky. It's not a brisk; it's a bris. All this brisket talk is making me hungry. And why do you do the books this way? Your system is crazy. It's the only way to keep our heads above water, my love. Well, then, we've got to find a way to cut down on expenses. What can we live without? Uh, probably Gene and Tina. That's a good start. Huh, well, it makes the things I was gonna cut irrelevant. Good. You know what? I could get a part-time job. Huh, what? No, Lin, it hasn't come to that yet. Yeah, you're right. Hey, maybe I'll start shopping at that Fresh Feed place up the street. I hear it's really cheap. Oh, yeah, that's good. They have those peanut butter mini donuts. I prefer the yogurt-covered peanut butter mini donuts, but, hey, I have a refined palette. Refined? You lick your own armpits. They're naturally spicy. "People go nuts for our nuts." (laughs) What a hoot. I love it. "In a hurry for some curry?" Hmm, kind of. Mmm... mmm... mmm. Hey, buddy, one sample per customer. A serving size is four mini egg rolls. Therefore, four pieces equals one sample. Good day, sir. (growls) I think there's someone behind the milk. Maybe it's a dairy fairy. Or a stalker watching our every move with their creepy frozen eyes. Hi. Look at these crazy low prices. Excuse me, Greg. Uh, hi, Greg. Yeah, can you tell me where the wine is? Ah, the grown-up grape juice. Come with me to our vineyard. Ooh, wine in a squeeze bottle. Fun. (disco music playing) Oh. Huh? It's time for a disco minute. How long's it last? A minute. It must be great working here. Yup, we have fun. It's kind of our thing. I love it when a place has a thing. And the hours are flexible, which is fantastic for someone like me. You never know when the perfect breeze is going to blow. Huh? I'm a semipro kite pilot. A what? I don't understand. What part do you not understand? The words-- I don't understand them. I'm a kite pilot. Kite pilot. Mm-hmm, my babies. Okay. Wow, that's great. So there's flexible hours here, huh? Hey, did this just become a job interview? You interested? Me? What? No. No, I don't know, I couldn't-- no... Guess who got a job at Fresh Feed. Check it out. That's what Mom will be doing at the checkout. Yeah, paper or plastic, Mom? Am I right? All right. What, you got a job? But it hasn't come to that yet, remember? I think what Mom's trying to say is: "Take this job and shove it, Bob!" Yeah, I'm bringing home the bacon now. (laughs) Oh, I forgot to get bacon. We have to go back! (panting) You really got out of bed this morning. I couldn't wait! Oh, I'm so freaking excited about my first day on the job! Yeah, I heard you the first time, when you were singing in the shower.  I'm so freaking excited  About my first day on the job.  Yeah! Ow, ow! Soap in my eye! You finally got out, Mom. Don't look back. It's only part-time. Don't be so dramatic. It's just something I'm doing to save the family. No big deal. Hey, Greg! Hey, Linda. Show me around. Give me the tour. Okay. A little pushy there. Ooh, is that a water cooler? Oh, God, I'm gonna be gossiping around a real water cooler like on TV! I love it. Aw... This is the bread aisle. There's Mitch. He's in a Steve Miller Band cover band. Hey, does anyone call you the Space Cowboy? Yeah, but right now I'm the Gangster of Loaves. Ooh... Good one, Mitch! They get funnier every time. It's a little buggy in produce. Yeah, turns out flies like fruit. Thanks for pointing that out, though. Mort: How you gonna get by without Linda, Bob? She's only working part-time. I'll be fine. Did Linda show you how to work the thermostat? It's the same as it always is. No. Linda accounts for outside temperature, grill temperature, the number of customers in here. Linda can play that thermostat like a violin. Now that you mention it, I do feel a little shvitzy. Oh, me, too. Shirt's coming off. Fine, I'll turn it down. That's not how Linda does it, Bobby. You overshot it. Now we're all gonna freeze. What are you talking about? I moved it, like, two degrees, Teddy. Two degrees is everything. Two degrees k*lled the dinosaurs! Fine! I'll move it back! Too far again. (groans) That's got to come off! Aah! We're gonna start you off nice and easy today. On the ten-items- or-less register. If they have 11, ban 'em or scan 'em. Your call. Oh, my call! Okay. I'm in charge. To a point. Excuse me, did someone lose a monkey? (both chuckle) You're gonna do just fine here. Hey, with Linda gone, we can get into some raunchy locker room talk. Hey, let's describe our testicles with a movie title. (laughs) BOB: What? The Wild Bunch! Wait a minute. What are we doing? One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. (laughs) You have one testicle? You knew that. (door opens) Hey, Bob. Whoa. It's warm in here. Yes, I know, Mike. Thanks. Linda got a part-time job. Teddy, you're looking good. Uh... I don't know. You got a lot of bills here. It's all bills. You guys should pay your bills. Mike's smart. Yup. Hey, we're doing locker room talk. Tell us about your testicles. Good-bye.  Linda stocked corn and she don't care  Linda stocked corn and she don't care  Linda stocked corn and she don't care...  'Cause she's also got diced tomatoes.  Whoo!  Hey nice cans, lady. Kids! You came to see Mommy at her new job? Come on. I'll introduce my home family to my new work family. Hey, Jamie, these are my kids. Kids, this is your new brother, Jamie. Hey, what's up? Go ahead with the tour, Mother. I'm going to visit with James. That's right, I'm part of the Fresh Feed family now, so don't bother with the toothpicks. They just slow me down. (gobbling loudly) Who wants a balloon? Actually, I would like many balloons. I'm gonna do something I should've done years ago. I was hoping you could take me on a tour of the dairy fridge. Oh, yeah. Sure, honey. Yeah. Come on. (humming) Ooh! Go! Be free! You'll float for a few days! Maybe a week. Who knows? But you'll live. You'll live! Wow. It's like I'm backstage at a Broadway show... about people who buy milk. Ooh, I'd see that show-- sort of. Hey, Linda, grab a mop, will you? Aisle three's got a spill-a-roosh. Will do-a-roosh. That's fun. Okay, I'll be right back, honey. No hurry. What if I put that hand on that arm? And those hips on those legs? Come on, Tina, don't play God. It's dangerous. Oh, that hand is so handsome. Boy: What? What? Is someone back there? Maybe. How'd you hurt your finger? My turtle bit me. Oh, no. Ah, I was being a jerk. He was just being a turtle. How old are you? I'm, um... How old are you? Uh, you first. We'll say it at the same time. One, two... Both: Twenty-five. Both: Really? No, 13. No, 14. Cool! So... you like chocolate milk? Yes. No. But... yes. You sound complicated. Well, I like it, but my body doesn't like it. So I'm trying to train my body to like it. You're brave. No. I'm lactose intolerant. (sighs) Labels. (phone buzzes) Ah. Mom's texting me. I got to go. Wait! What's your name? Or number? Or measurements? He's gone... (sniffs) but not forgotten. I'm going to use this to find him. I'm looking for a boy with a turtle bite on his index finger. Isn't every woman? So, did, uh... did your mom mention anything about missing the restaurant? No, she seems happy at Fresh Feed. But maybe I just think that because she kept saying how happy she is. Let her live a little, Dad. She's only been off leash one day. Yeah, give the woman some breathing room, needy-saurus rex.  Look at me  I'm wrangling these carts on my own  Look at me  I'm chopping up this lettuce alone  I'm at work  And you can hear me sing  Both:  This is working, this is working  (humming)  Grind, grind, grind, grind  Look at me  I'm sitting in this thing Grind, grind, grind, grind  Grind, grind, grind, grind  Is it on?  La la la la la  Look at me  I've barely even noticed that she's gone  La la la la la  Mommy is a-working  Someone threw up  In the bathroom sink  You can hear me sing  Both:  This is working, this is working.    Kids, listen. Your mom... she wants to be here, right? Oh, yeah. Of course. Yeah, sure. It's so great here. Uh, yeah, I think so. Hello, my family. Oh, God, it's hot. Guess who aced her first performance review! Listen, Lin, uh, I want to say something. Are you gonna say that I got all A's on my report card? In all Fresh Feed areas? Report cards at work? Really? Yeah, I aced my first week. They want me to go full-time. Shift manager. You're not gonna take it, right? No, it's just nice that they appreciate me there. That's all. Oh, come on, Lin. You're feeling underappreciated here? A little bit. What, do you want me to give you a performance review? That would be a nice start, Bob. (laughing): Hold on, hold on, let me get comfy. And... evaluate your wife. Okay. Uh, Linda, you clean the bathroom well. Okay. And you know how to restock a napkin dispenser. All right. But you're on the phone sometimes when you shouldn't be. Ooh. And you don't wear a hairnet and you hair falls out a lot. What?! And you're always sneaking pickles! But you are, um... Come on, Dad. You've got this, Dad. You're sometimes friendly to people. Oh! Mom, huh?! Yeah. That's nice. Not enjoying this. Uh, but you're... Anything else? ...your hands are often dirty. So, you get an eight out of ten. Well, maybe a 7.5. What?! No, eight. Definitely an eight out of ten. Eight out of ten?! Well, Fresh Feed loves me! They gave me a locker. A locker, Bob! Maybe I should go full-time! Great. Have fun with your locker and your report cards and your Steve Miller Band cover bands. They have a name! The Abracadabblers. I will have fun! Because it's fun there! Then go ahead, Lin. If you don't want to be here, then don't be here! We'll be fine without you! Okay, I will! I'm a full-time Fresh Feeder! And here's a review for you! (blowing raspberries) Uh, Dad's gonna need your g*n and your badge, too, Mom. I get her apron because it still smells like her and I like it because I'm 11 and I still like Mom. (blowing raspberries) Okay, kids, I'll see you tonight. I'm working a full day today. Bye, Mom. I'll probably see you later when I swing by to hang out in the milk fridge. Sorry, kids. You can't go to Fresh Feed. I need you here. No! Your father's right, my babies. You better stay here. 'Cause he's a disaster without me. No, I'm not. I'm kidding. You're not. No... Yes, you are! Bob: I didn't... I... (grunts) All right, Linda, here are the keys to the kingdom. Oof. Ten pounds of keys. Ten pounds of fun! You all set for your first day as shift manager? You bet! I've got my shift together. Great! If you need me, I'll be in Bog Harbor with my fellow kiters. And I just mighters see you tonighters. Hey, Greg, go fly a kite. (laughs) I'm kidding. That's what he does. That's his hobby. Uh, I need quarters. I'll just use my manager key. 'Cause I'm the manager. (disco music starts playing over the PA) Oh, disco minute! (g nting) Hey, Linda, I'm supposed to be writing funny signs, but I'm just not feeling it. You think I could switch to the frozen aisle? Uh, okay. What do you say we take a look at the shift board, huh? Shift board, shift board... where are you? There you go. Okay, I'll, uh... you know what, I'll just take care of it. Mitch: Ah, thanks, Linda. You rock. Oh, hey, nobody ever said I rock at my old job, and I was sleeping with the boss. (laughs) Oh, no, you must be bad at s*x. Same boat. Keep trying. Hey, Linda, I need to pick up my kids at school or something. Can I cut out for the day? Of course! Family first, right? Also, I think I'm gonna be sick tomorrow. Huh? What? Nothing. I'll call you tomorrow. (sighs) How can I find my dream boy if I can't find him? Hey, buck up, little fella. This guy is findable. Let's post this "missed connections" flyer around town. "Me: a freak in the fridge. "You: a freak with a freaked-up finger. "If you want to see where this can go, "come to Bob's Burgers Wednesday between 3:00 and 5:00 p.m. Freak to be you and me?" It's perfect. Okay, let's hang these up. You sure you don't want to add "dead or alive"? Ooh, good point. Just so we're clear, you want the whole boy or just his hand? Tina: Whatever I can get. (groans) Jamie! Oh, thank God you're here. Listen, grab these shopping carts. I need to jump on a register. Is it cool if I grab a nap instead? I just ate a meat loaf and drank a beer, and I am wiped out. Grab a nap? No! Mitch: Manager Linda? We got a shipment in the delivery bay. You need to sign. Whoo, whoo! Okay, I'm coming, coming. No nap! Just a little one. No nap! Just a little rest for the eyes. See you in 20. No nap! Tina: I'll find you. Until then, avoid infection.  Hey, Linda, cover for me? I got to fly like an eagle out of here for a Steve Miller Band cover band rehearsal. Time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin'. Well, I'm sorry, sorry, sorry, but I can't because I'm covering for someone... (gags) Thanks! (glass breaking) Did I give everyone the day off? Oh, God, I got to call Greg. Yeah! (phone buzzes) (phone rings) Bob's Burgers. This is Tina. Are you him? Tina, sweetie! Uh, you want to come hang out with Mommy? There's yummy samples. You're allowing us back at Fresh Feed? Can I go in the milk fridge? Yeah. Yeah, sure. Yeah, the milk fridge. You can restock and... You're all out of shopping carts. Well, then just buy what you can hold, honey! Oh, and, uh... bring your brother and sister. I love them.  This is working, this is working...  Gene: Hey, Mom. Where's this new batch of samples? Are they savory or are they crave-ory? Oh, forget about the samples. You get to help Mommy bag, okay? Ah, man. You tricked us. If we wanted to work, we would have just stayed home. Yeah, if we lived here, we'd be at work by now. I'll help in the dairy fridge. Louise, uh... grab that pricing g*n and-and price those tuna cans. $1.29. Okay, come on, here we go. All I heard was "grab that pricing g*n." Hey, Dmitri. My check bounced? Uh, you know, we're a little strapped this week. Is it okay if we get it to you next week? Little strapped? Bob, you said you were, like, double overdrawn. Little strapped! Teddy, shush! Shh, yeah, right. (dial tone) Oh, he hung up. Guess that means no meat, huh? Big day for fries. Right? (sighs) Linda has this crazy system for our finances. I forgot to make the deposit, and we got checks out all over the place. Including the power company. Doesn't matter. You don't have any food. You know, this kind of makes me want to loot you. What? Never mind. This isn't working. I'm gonna go get Linda. I'm closing. You got to go, Teddy. What? Why? It's dark. There's no food. There's nothing here for you. That's okay. Go on! Scat! Bob-a-do, bob-a-do, bob-a-do, bop bop bop... No, not...I mean... Scatty batty batty boop bop... I meant "go," not "scat." Go! Go! No! Where am I supposed to go? Shoo! (groans) Get out, Teddy! (growls) Aah! Aah! (growls) Get out! So I should go? Linda: H-How are you? Nice day? Find everything all right? Good, good. Okay. Fresh Feed? More like Long Wait. Get it? Okay, here's your receipt. Next in line! Next! Hey, careful with the eggs, huh? This is careful. Want to see loosey-goosey? Um, a pyramid of grapefruits fell on a lady. I think she's trapped. What? Uh, Gene, you've just been promoted to register! Uh... My first promotion! Watch out, glass ceiling! What are we looking at here? Mmm... bananas. What is that, chicken? Let's just say 30 bucks. 30 bucks? Okay, five bucks. Sorry. Guh. Next! Ooh, someone likes pasta. (humming) Dollar whiskey, dollar scotch, dollar bourbon, dollar crotch. Hey! Great prices! Wish I still drank! (loud chatter) What the hell is going on here? Gene, where's your mother? She's... around here somewhere. Might want to check poultry. (people shouting, grunting) Does this thing work? I don't know. It's my first day here. Linda? It's Bob. Wh-What? Listen, Lin, I'm sorry I acted like I didn't need you. Of course I need you. I can't run the restaurant by myself. Hey, can you ring me up? No, I don't work here. So, Linda, listen... Come on. I have one item. Just take it. Hey, this guy's letting us take stuff! Free aisle! All right, I'm going on break. So, what I really want to tell you is... you make it fun to work at the restaurant. I'd rather be scraping by together than have extra money and be apart. But I understand if you want to try this new life out. I mean... I don't really see the appeal-- it's a pretty nasty market-- but if it makes you happy, then it makes me happy. Hey, come on. That's too much. Oh, Bob, it's awful here. This is just a job. Everyone who works here just wants to leave. I hate it, and I hate the customers. I'm sorry. I know you people can hear me. I just hate it. Yeah, it's called a microphone. She told me she hates you the most. What? Bobby, I want to come back to the restaurant. Oh, Lin... Meet me at register five. I'm on my way! Oh, Linda. Oh, Bob. Oh! Oof, shrimp. (gags, coughs) It's happening! What? Louise, what did you do? I made it rain shrimp. What'd you ever do? Get underneath them! They're self-dipping! Tina: Give up, Tina.a. You're cold and lonely. And you shouldn't have drank that gallon of milk. (gasps) Hi. I'm Tina from the fridge. Can I see your index finger? Nothing weird. It fits. Is it you? Did you come back? I did. Every day this week. For me or the milk? For both. I can't stop thinking about you. I want to meet face-to-face. I-I don't know. What if we ruin what we have? Shh, shh. Don't say that. I can't reach. Here. Shh. Thank you. Take a chance for once in your life. If it doesn't work out, we'll always have the milk. I'm coming out. (grunts) (grunts) I'm stuck. I know you can't see the other half of me, but trust me, it's there. (chanting): Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! (sighs) Wow. I'm Josh. Joshua... Bob: What's Tina doing? Tina, stop kissing strange boys in the dairy fridge. We're going home! I have to go. Here's a bunch of numbers. They may look random, but they're my phone number. Cool. They look like they're in a good order. Oh, hey, Linda. (chuckles) The strings were tight today, boy. Everything good here? Hi, Greg. Thanks for taking a chance on me. I quit, but don't let that influence hiring other pre-middle-age mothers. Okay, thanks, bye. What? I... (gasps) Greg: Hey! Well, I guess, now that I don't work at Fresh Feed anymore, we're back to scrimping and saving. Maybe we can find other ways to make some extra money. Louise: If there's one thing I know, it's that s*x sells. So all we have to do is find some s*x and sell it.
Gene: Anyone notice anything different about me? New boobs? New 'tude? Wrong and wronger. I'm pregnant! Wha...? We're getting flour sack babies in health class. You do have that glow. Aw, my little baby's having babies. I'm a sexy grandma. I can't believe they're going to let you be in charge of a child. What are you talking about? I was born to be a mother. I'm gonna pull a flour sack out of my bottom. Bob: Morning, everyone. Wow, Don Draper's kind of fat this season. Ooh, you look sharp, mister. The jury is gonna find you guilty of handsome in the first degree. Oof, um, ah. I'm contesting a parking ticket, Lin. There isn't a jury. You've got a suit that won't a-quit. Wait a second, there's no stains on that. That's not your suit. My suit didn't fit anymore, so I borrowed this from Mort. Some poor guy's wife brought two for the burial and left this one behind. Why don't I ever get to wear dead people's clothes? When I'm gone, I'll leave you all my socks. Aw, I wanted those. Okay, class, now that you've been assigned life partners, kiss your childhood good-bye and your babies hello. Let's have all the fathers come up and assume responsibility for their reckless behavior. Travis Albright. He has your eyes. But hopefully not your A.D.D. Huh? Gene Belcher. He's beautiful. Now, remember, even the smallest mistake will affect your child's life forever. (gasps) Oh, my God! I'm sorry. Can I have another one? I don't know, Gene. Can people just have another baby? Well, yes, they can. So here you go. But if you drop this one, I'll have to fail you. Ah! Gene, you're getting an F. Ah! For "failing father." I can fix this! (grunting) See, he's fine. He's good; He's happy. Ah! I need a baby! (gasping) Go back to your seat, Gene. And wipe that baby off your face. I couldn't see the meter because there was a kid standing in front of it, and, um, he was exactly meter-sized. Really? Yeah. Meter-sized? Well, and-and I think he was loitering, sir. Well, Mr. Belcher... we're gonna let this one go. Really? Yes. I'm dismissing the ticket. Okay, wow. Maybe next time use the valet, huh? (chuckles) (chuckles): I will. I definitely will... Next case! You look important. Will you marry my mom? What? Uh, oh, um... Sweetie, sweetie, don't bother that nice gentleman. I'm so sorry. He's an idiot. Ah, I'm sure. "Gentleman." Wow. I would've been a great dad. Louise: Gene, cheer up. Why not focus your energy on losing that baby weight? No! I'm moping. I'm gonna take the long way home. Tell Mom not to make anything for dinner with flour. And a flour-less chocolate cake for dessert! (tone chimes) What was that? Robotic Voice: Hello. Who said that? Hello. Are you a ghost? 'Cause I'm a Ghostbuster! And I'm a police officer. And a Sagittarius. I do not understand your command. Please sit to create profile. (screams) Please log in with name now. Gene. Hello, Gene. Please sit to create profile. Okay, but don't try anything funny. Request for funny activated. Loading joke. You know jokes? Knock-knock. Who's there? Botany. Botany who? Bot-any good toilets lately? (laughs): I get it! Did you like that? I have a million of them. 1,100,005. You are so cool. Cooling seat now. No, no, warm it up. I like my buns toasted. Warming seat now. (sighs): Mmm. Gene: Who's the Queen of England? Toilet: Elizabeth the second. Who's the Queen of the Night? Whitney Houston. Who's the Queen of the... wait a second! Bidet? Don't mind if I bid-do. (gasps) I knew that would happen, but I did it anyway. (classical music playing) I'm not just saying this because I'm your friend, but that is amazing. (beep) Alert. Auxiliary water tank low. I require maintenance from primary user. "Primary user"? Wow, I've never cared for a toilet of my own before. I guess you're never really ready. There you go, thirsty boy. Thank you, Gene. Activating night light. Uh-oh, it's night already? I better go home. I'm gonna bet my sisters $1,000 that there isn't a talking toilet in the woods. That's what I call easy money. Playing artist Eddie Money. (rock music playing) No, no, cancel! Undo! Cancelling Eddie Money. (music stops) (sighs) Wow, you really listen. You're the best. Okay, see ya. Good-bye, Gene. (whistling classical music) Hey, little man. Huh? Where'd you hear that song you're whistling? It wasn't a song. I-I was making fun of a bird. Well, a little bird told me you might have seen something I'm looking for: A toilet. I haven't seen one. I-I've never even used one! Come here, just for a sec. Uh, no. I want to tell you something. Ma... okay. Yell it. I mean, I mean, I want to give you something. I already have enough. You don't know what it is. I know. I just feel like I know what I can carry and I have my... night planned. You won the lottery. Oh. Then I better go quit my job! Where is it?! (panting) Where's my toilet?! (grunting) (groans) You're my baby boy now, Belcher. I'm not sure, but I think people are treating me different because of this suit. Last night on the street, this homeless guy saluted me. Can't believe I almost buried that suit. If you buried it now, it'd probably claw itself out of the grave to get back on Bobby. That would make a great movie. Suit Cemetery. I'd see that, but only the matinee. I wouldn't want to come home to a dark closet. Ooh, here comes the three-piece! Ah, I... Bow tie, oh, look out! Oh, it got me! Linda, please. I don't want to find another place to eat. I'm dead. Excuse me, do you know where Maestro's Bistro is? Sorry, no, I... What about this place? Hmm, I don't know. How's the food here? Uh, it's really good. I eat here every day. Mmm. Oh. If it's good enough for him. Well, uh, since I'm dining alone, maybe I'll join you. You dining alone? How does that happen? Whoa, whoa, ladies! Bring it down a notch, huh? Why don't I get you a nice booth in the back, right? We were all single once, but you don't got to be a slut about it, you know? It's just a little bit further, and it's amazing! Is it a body, like in Stand By Me? Or a great math teacher, like in Stand and Deliver? I present to you, voila! (tone chimes) Hello, Gene. (gasps) What the hell? New user detected. Please say your name to create profile. Holy crap! Hello, Holy Crap. Hi. And boom, my friend the toilet. Say "pupu platter." Pupu platter. Say "nuclear wiener." Nuclear wiener. Say "hypothalamus." Toilet: Hypothalamus. (giggling) Say "I love you, Tina." I love you, Tina. Say "I love you, Tina. I'm not a toilet, I'm a boy." No. Oh. Alert. Auxiliary water tank low. Please fill. Okay, time for din-din. Why don't you just breast-feed it, Gene? I tried. This one only takes a bottle. Thank you. Maintenance complete. You're really great with him, Gene. He's just a really good toilet. (tone chimes) Alert. Three hours of battery life remaining. Please connect to a power source. Power source? What power source? I require a dedicated 220 volt ground fault circuit interrupter. Don't worry, we'll get you out of here. Adrenaline, do your thing! (grunting) Gene, calm down. You're not the first person who's had to find a power source for his talking toilet. Right, right. We'll have to go home and get some batteries, extension cords. We'll steal a car, we'll siphon the gasoline into a generator. We'll help you, Gene. Thanks, T. It takes a village to charge a toilet. Where have you kids been? It's late. Glee club. Key club. Ski club? Oh, extracurriculars. I love it. Yeah, we have a triple-club emergency. We need extension cords and lots of them. Well, well, well, if it isn't Baby Boy Belcher. (screams) Did you lose this somewhere? (screams) Uh, kids, this guy's looking for a lost toilet. And he's not crazy. He's Max, uh... sorry, I didn't, uh, catch your last name. Eh, Flush. Your name's Max Flush and you're looking for a toilet? (laughs): That's funny. (laughs): And his name is Bob Burger. What? His name is Bob Burger. Um, it's not. It is. It isn't, no. It's not? No. Are you serious? Bob Burgers. How... Bob Burgers. Then who am I thinking of? I don't know. But-but the sign. Okay, well, I'm still missing a toilet. I was delivering it, but it fell off my truck. My toilet's worth $14,000. So I'm gonna find it. $14,000? For 14 grand, I'd let that toilet poop on me. (laughs) Lin. My toilet's special. State of the art. I'm very motivated to find it. Have you told the toilet how you feel? The toilet knows how I feel! Okay, Mr. Flush, we'll-we'll let you know if we see it, and, uh, we're closing early, so... Closing early? Yeah, I'm gonna use the money I saved on that ticket and take Linda and my suit out to a nice dinner. We're going to Beville's! It's fancy. They give you bread in a basket with a napkin inside of it. Can I come? No. Oh. Okey dokey. I guess I'll just be on my way then. (whistling classical music) Before we go, we should take out the trash. Lin, do you mind? I'm kind of in a suit. Okay, but I'm not gonna lie down in any puddles for you to cross, mister. Just kidding, I will. (kisses) Oh, no, he's not leaving! He's staking us out. We'll have to lay low for a while. We can't lay low. We have to get back to the toilet! We'll need a plan. Tina, cancel all of my appointments. That's gonna take a while. Gene, hold my calls. (screams) Now he wants to switch eyes! Okay, operation Capture the Throne is go. Andy and Ollie are on their way here. Everybody know what they're doing? In general or in the plan? The plan, Tina. Oh, whew. We just have to wait for Mom and Dad to get out of here, already. The toilet's only got two hours left. Linda: How do I look? Well, no one's gonna be looking at you, Lin. Oh. Bye! Bye. Bye. Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye. Bye. Bye, bye. Bye. Stay out of my room. (door closes)   Here come Andy and Ollie. What's taking them so long? They're both trying to carry each other at the same time. (both grunting) Sorry, Samantha. (grunts) I'm Tina! No, you're me. Oh. I'm selling pens to benefit my Beaver Scout troo. How many can I put you down for? (scoffs) None. Seven? Zero. Zero hundred and seven? Oh, fine, I'll take two. (engine starts) Hey! (tires screeching) Linda: Party of two-ty-toot-toot. (laughs) I'm a fun customer; You're gonna love me. I'm sorry, unless you have a reservation, it's an hour wait. An hour, really, hmm? Oh, are you together? Maybe we have something. Let me check. May I bring you a cocktail? Ooh, appletinis. Uh, yeah, we'll have two. Two each. (chuckles) I'm serious. I'm coming, toilet! Don't you quit on me! (kids panting) (tires screech) Guess we're in the same boat now, Baby Boy Belcher. (chuckles) Oh, my. (ball bounces) What the...? (groans) Have a great time on King's Head lsland, sucker! Rent a golf cart; They're super fun. This isn't over! I can make my knees smile. (panting) Toilet? Hello, Gene. Maintenance required. Don't worry, help is on the way. 33 minutes of battery life remaining. Everything's going to be okay. We'll be telling jokes again in no time. Loading joke. Knock-knock. Who's there? Interrupting toilet. Interrupting toilet...? (makes flushing sound) (laughs, cries) Hang in there, buddy. We're going to get you fixed up. These are from the couple over there. Thank you. Ah... not for you, for him. Oh. Oh, I still haven't finished my s*x on the Beach from that foot clinic doctor. Yeah, we got to pick up the pace. Double fist 'em... go. I don't know, Lin, I mean, I drove, or maybe you drove. One of us drove, right? It's all right, we-we'll take a snatchy. What? We'll take a snatchy. (laughs): What-What's a snatchy? The yellow thing. Well, I need a better hint than that. It's got wheels. A taxi? (laughs): Yeah, a snacky. You said... Snacky! Wait, you keep changing it. You got it, stop teasing me. Well, you said "snatchy." Shut up, drink. Okay. 11 minutes of battery life remaining. Where are they? (shudders) It's getting cold out here. Warming seat. No, save your energy! I'll warm my butt the old-fashioned way. (grunting) Finally. Hello, what a beauty. She's a hottie potty, baby, haw! Wow, does it wipe for you, too? What's wipe? Now, I got to pee in this baby. No, get away from him, you monster! He's dying! We don't have much time! Flush some chicken soup into him! Or put on a movie he likes! Yeah. Everybody, close your eyes and believe. No, we have to move him. Lift with your butts. (all grunting) Oh, man. This is heavier than my mom at the prom. 'Cause she was pregnant with me. Nine minutes of battery life remaining. Oh, no, no, no, no. Hurry, hurry... go! Mush, mush! You can't flush me. (giggles) Wow, Beville's was great, but I'm still kind of hungry. Me, too. Did we forget to eat? Oh, my God, we did. (both laugh) Who cares? Let's just make out. Uh, scenic route, sir? You betcha. (Linda and Bob laughing) Hang in there, buddy, we're almost there. Pedal with your heart! (tires screeching) Ah, it's Max Flush! Pedal faster! That way! (kids screaming) I don't see him. Yeah! We're doing it, we're doing it! Whoo-hoo, we're home free! Wait, there's no bridge. Stop! (tires screeching) Fly, toilet, fly! Toilets can't fly, Gene. This one can! Activate wings! Playing artist Wings. N-N-N-N-No. (screams) (screams) (grunting) (tires screech) No...! If you want this toilet, you'll have to go through me, Max Flush! Gene? Dad? Mom? What you doing in the middle of the road with a toilet? He's more than a toilet! He's my best friend and he's dying! Okay. Ah, now he's losing fluids! W-Wait, is this that guy's missing $14,000 toilet? We need to get him to a power source immediately. Well, I-I don't think we can ask the cab driver to... Toilet in the taxi, sir? Really? (all cheering) I still don't really understand what's happening. I don't either, but I'm having fun. (laughs) There's a coffee shop... they'll have outlets. For people writing screenplays. Pull over! (all grunting) Bob: I'm drunk. Toilet: Two minutes of battery life remaining. Hey, you can't bring that in here. Your sign says restrooms are for customers only, not that customers can't bring in their own restrooms. That restroom is mine. Hey, toilet guy. Look, my son found your toilet. And I'll never give him back! You just want to take him somewhere where he'll get pooped on! I'll never let that happen! I'll never let anything bad happen to him ever! Battery dead. Good-bye. No...! Kid, he's a toilet. He'll be fine once he's recharged. There's a family waiting for him... a very nice family... so let me take him. He belongs with me, and you'll never be able to move both of us! Yeah, if you think you're gonna get Gene off the toilet before he's ready, I've got some bad news for you. He missed his birthday party once. We had a clown. We had to send him in there. You give me that toilet! What's the problem here? (chuckles): No problem, no problem. These people brought in an outside toilet and they refuse to leave. Yeah, you should probably deal with that. Hey, that looks like that toilet that was reported stolen. Welp, sure hope you figure that out. Freeze! Stop right there. Get him! (grunts) Yeah! Oh! Where you're going, they don't have any toilets. Well, they do, but it's out in the open and it's embarrassing. Warm my butt. You're useless, useless! Gene, stop yelling at the toilet. It just sits there and takes it. I know that fancy toilet was your friend and you liked him, but he wasn't yours and he's probably evidence now. He needed me to take care of him, Dad, and I let him down. I'll never get to have anything nice, like a bag of flour or a toilet. Look, Gene, it's not easy to take care of things. I mean, one time when you were a baby and I was watching you, you ate a fern, and you could have died, but you didn't. Huh. My point is, you tried to take care of the toilet and you did the best you could. That's all anyone can do. I guess. Sorry I yelled at you. It's not your fault you're stupid. Linda: Gene, get in here! Your friend's on TV! Olsen Benner (over TV): This morning, the ferry's most important passenger isn't a person, it's a toilet. (gasps) It's him! This $14,000 toilet was allegedly stolen by a Timones J aka the Bathroom Burglar. He said his name was Max Flush. And you believed that? Um... Eh... Ah... um, no, I'm... Yeah... no, wha... why... Fittingly, this royal flusher is headed back to its rightful owner on King's Head lsland. Live from the ferry landing, I'm Olsen Benner. Mom, get the car. I have to go to the toilet. Ooh, I got chills when you said that. There he is. Gene, go! Whoa, whoa, whoa, sorry, kid, can't go near that toilet. Uh, Officer, can you cut him a break? It's a long story, but he-he just wants to say good-bye. Kind of weird, but, all right, sir, your kid's got one minute. Hello, toilet. I know you can't hear me, but I just... Hello, Gene. Toilet, they charged you. Activate bidet? Yes! I-I mean, no. I think I just have time to say good-bye. Good-bye, Gene. I... I love you. Please repeat command. I love you. You would like to vomit? No, I love you. Seat up for vomit. No, I love you. Vomit now. I love you. Vomit. I love you! Vomit now. Vomit now. (groans) Stop saying that! Vomit now. Damn fool! Okay, this is just sad. I know. Huh, that suit looks just like one my dad had. Yeah, it's a nice one, huh? I love it. Yeah, let me see the label. Um, I... There's my dad's name. "Tailored for Paul McGill." That's weird... his name is Bob Burgers. That's my dad's suit! Where'd you get it? A funeral home? What?! A funeral home. It's a home for funerals. (boat horn blowing) I'll never forget that toilet. I'll never forget that suit. At least you still got your birthday suit. Yeah, too bad it's wrinkly. Let's get Dad dry-cleaned. Nah, I'll press him. (grunting) ("Baby Hold On" playing)  Baby, hold on to me, oh, yeah  Whatever will be will be  The future is ours to see, yeah, come on  So, baby, hold on to me  Hold it  Think about it, baby  I'm gonna take you to the top  So, baby, hold on to me, hold on tight  Whatever will be will be, say it again, the future is... 
(keyboard playing laser blasting, dog barking, farting) Okay, tell me the truth, am I stuck in a laser/dog bark/fart rut? No. Yes. (sighs) Has anyone seen my volcano? Did you check all your pockets? Can you describe what it looks like? Well, it's volcano-shaped, and it's my science fair project from last year. Oh, it's in the liquor cabinet. I've been using it as a wine koozie. It's fun, I love it. Introducing my science fair project for this year. Hold on. Wait, you're turning in the same project again? Will Mr. Blevins let you do that? Yeah, Louise, he's not just a teacher, he's the head of the science fair. He must be swimming in women. Don't worry about Blevins. I can play him like a fiddle. A strange, puffy fiddle with a ponytail and a sad butt. Louise, shouldn't you just do a new project, like you're supposed to? Why? Um, I don't know, to learn something? You learn something. Okay honey, good luck with your volcano. 123, 124... (sighs): What are you two kooks doing? It's for our science fair project: "How Many Hairs Are Up There?" The tough part is keeping them all organized. I ga... Oh! One, two... You guys are working too hard. As per "uuge." Good morning, children. My name is Mr. Dinkler, and I will be taking over this science class. Whoa, whoa whoa, what? What happened to Mr. Blevins? He's dead. To this classroom. He's at home recovering from a severe attack of gout. But I'm sick of talking about him, so let's just move on already. Some of you might recognize me if you've been down to the Science Museum on Tuesday nights. I am a Thomas Edison impersonator and reenactor. Thomas Edison was the greatest genius who ever lived. (sarcastic laugh) Oh, boy. Can anyone name any of his inventions? The lightbulb... The lightbulb. The phonograph. The kinetoscope. It goes on and on and on, basically everything. So, I know the fourth grade science fair is coming up, because I'm in charge of it now. I only have one rule for science fairs: No vol-ca-noes. Huh? Kids have been using these papier-matcher monstrosities to avoid real work for years, and I'll have none of it. (laughing): Okay, Mr. Dinkler, time out. Relax. I already got the go-ahead from Mr. Blevins on my volcano. Dinkler: Huh? So, I'm kind of grandfathered in there. What is your name, young lady? It's Louise, as in "Jeez, Louise, you're the best." Why don't we find you another topic? Oh, no, that's not necessary. I already got it. I'll pick one for you. Don't need to, I got one. Yeah... Thank you so much. Nope, gonna pick one. And it's the best topic in the world: Thomas Edison! Um, but I'm doing Thomas Edison. You can both do Edison, moron. There's enough of him to go around, trust me. (sighs) Mr. Dinkler, you're new here, so please don't be offended if I disregard everything you say and turn in Mt. Louise-ius here. Wow, I bet stuff comes out of the top where this hole is and it's just a real hoot. Yeah. Oh, no. Oops. (screaming) Why did I throw that down? Wha... Oh, wha... I'm stepping on it? No! Why am I stepping on it? (Louise screaming) Over and over and over again. Stop it! (Louise screaming) Uh-huh. You're doing Edison, kid. How about some science, huh? Ugh, I can't believe that guy. Hmph. And now I have to go to the library, which I never wanted to have to do. Ugh! Yeah, ugh! Wait, I like the library. I need information on Thomas Edison. Something no one would recognize if plagiarized. Biographies, under "E." Thanks. That's my job. And I love it. (whispers): Topsy. Hmm? I didn't say anything. (whispers): Tooooopsssyyyyy. Are you saying Top Chef? I think he said Topsy. No, I didn't. (whispers): Yes, I did. What's a Topsy? I don't know, don't ask me. (whispers): Look it up. Like in a book? Yeah, sure, books are great. (whispers): No, use the lnternet. Books are stupid. I thought books were smart. No, they're stupid. But you're a librarian. Yeah, so shh! Louise: Hmm. Topsy. Look, Topsy the circus elephant. Thomas Edison wanted to show the world that AC current was more dangerous than his own patented DC current... Blah, blah, blah. Oh, there's a video. Click that. Ooh, elephant. I bet it sneezes and it's adorable. (elephant trumpets, children scream) What was that? Play it again, Play it again. (elephant trumpets, children scream) It was electrocuted. To d*ath. On purpose. In public. By Thomas Edison. What is he, a supervillain? Well, it says that Topsy trampled three people. Well yeah, she's a big, fat elephant. The point is, I've got my science fair project. I'm gonna tell everyone the truth about Edison the Electro-cutioner. Tell it, sister. So heroic. Let me finish! And make Mr. Dinkler look like an evil-inventor-impersonating ass. There she is. Oh, right. Don't do it, Don't do it. (whispers): Do it, do it. And then I say, "Hey. Lightbulb. "I've got an idea: The lightbulb. I'm Edison, thank you." And everyone claps. Mr. Dinkler, shouldn't Louise and I make sure that we're not both doing the same thing for our Edison project? Well, let's see, Jeremy. Is your project going to blow everyone away? 'Cause if it's not, then don't worry about it. (laughing) What's so funny?! Hey, everybody, volcano-girl here is gonna blow our minds. Did you hear that, Tom? Well, I will! I've got something big, Mr. Dinkler. You ain't got nothing and you know it. You keep believing that, Mr. Dinkler. I will. You keep believing that, (laughing) Mr. Dink-ler. (both laughing) Yes, yes! Ha! Ha! Ha! Very... funny. Ha! Ah! Okay, change of plans. Some little report pasted onto construction paper isn't gonna be enough. Not for that punk. I hate construction paper. Dinkler's a reenactor. I'm going reenactment on his butt. With actors and effects and everything. We're gonna bring this nightmare to life. Oh. Oh. All right, I'm gonna need an Edison and a Topsy. Gene, can you give me a maniacal laugh? Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. Good enough, you're Edison. Tina, act like an elephant. Not bad, you're hired. Oh, you know what else your project needs? Science? Music. By me. Something dramatic, but danceable. Cha, cha, cha, cha. Fine, as long as we electrocute an elephant, it's okay with me. But not really electrocuting, just reenacting. Yes, Tina. Jeesh. Little Miss Don't- Really-Electrocute-Me over here. (chuckling): Diva. Mm-hmm. What else do you want on your rider? Hello, children. Ah, Teddy, come here. I'm doing a project and I need to make huge sparks and lightning bolts. What do you know about that stuff? In high school, my buddies and I built a Van de Graaff generator. You know, to get girls. Ah, nice. Will you do something like that for me? Adults aren't allowed to help, so you'll have to hide. But... eh? Sure. Let's go! Okay, no burger, that's fine. Ahh, I'm not freaking out here! Ahh... I know they're in here somewhere. Bob, come to bed. Here it is. All this science fair stuff reminded me of my old invention. Spiceps. Spice-wah? They're sleeves that you wear on your biceps to hold all your spices while you cook. Wha. Look, (growls). Okay, good night. Hey Lin, what if I was wearing just these. 'Cause, whoop, I am. All right, come here. I'm coming. (Bob growling) Linda: Wait, wait, wait, you're getting spice all over the bed. Topsy... autopsy... Is there something there? I'm not talking; I'm in character. Except, can I trample you? I'm trying to get in that head space. Yeah, sure. (feeble trumpeting) Did, uh, did you guys notice my Spiceps? Dad, not now. (feeble trumpeting) Pffh, Spiceps. You might have something there, if you just changed it completely. They're perfect the way they are. Dad, shush. Okay, Tina, as long as you have perfect pitch, we'll be fine. And a one, and a two.  They'll...  Hello, family. Ugh. Hi, Aunt Gayle. Hey, Gayle, I couldn't understand you on the phone earlier. You sounded like (muffled crying). Is everything all right? Everything's fine. (stammering, muffled crying) He can just be such a jerk sometimes. Aw, who honey? Wha? My cat. We got in a fight. Can I stay here for a while to cool off? Of course you can. Hey Gayle, check it out. (stammering, muffled crying) Okay, talk to you later. Tina, and a one, and a two.  They'll...  Hello, Belchers. Damn it! Don't mean to barge in, just here for the monthly rent. I say monthly, because I think there might be some confusion about that. Oh, hey, Mr. Fischoeder. Sorry, I'll write you a check right now. With my arms. Strangely specific, but whatever. Oh, look, a pen. Here. I'm good. Care for any cracked pepper? Uh... How about some thyme? Just write the check. Perhaps some marjoram? Write a check! How about a bay leaf? Oh. And a one, and a two...  They'll say aw, Topsy  At my autopsy Okay, here's a funny story.  But no... You cannot sing. What? Yeah, we're gonna have to replace you. No, I-I have a strong connection to this character. And there it goes. Wha-what about you? Can you sing? Ah, yeah. (clears throat)  They'll say aw, Topsy  At my...  Oh, my God I can't sing either! What are we gonna do?! (sniffling): That song's catchy.  They'll say aw, Topsy  At my autopsy.  It is catchy.  Aw, Topsy at my auuu-ho-ho-hoopsy  La, la, la, la, la Holy moly.  Are you thinking what I'm thinking? That we should ask Aunt Gayle and Mr. Fischoeder to keep it down? No, we should ask them to sing for us. But we're not allowed to use adults in school projects. We're gonna Milli Vanilli this. Sorry, I don't speak ltalian. We'll lip sync it! Lip synch it! (singing) So... what are you two doing on Friday besides singing from behind a curtain in our school auditorium? God, cooking is just too easy now. (grunting) So, after a lot of thought and some amazing sewing, I think I finally fixed your invention, Bob. Well, it didn't need fixing, so... Ta-da! It's the Spice Rack. Get it? Rack. (laughing) Ah, well, you look ridiculous. Oh, I look ridiculous? Yeah, you do. You're both right. I just took your idea and I made it good. What? No you didn't. Come on, kids, which is better? Pass. No, thank you. Bob: Tina? Tina? Uh... Huh, how about this? Huh, huh? Uh... It's not using s*x to sell. You want this, right? This one. I love you both equally! Oh, who cares?! Sorry. I love you, too.  He might electrocute me  That's true  Gayle:  But he's an electro-cutey  Fischoeder:  Aw, shucks.   Um... wha... AC to DC, come in, DC, over. DC here. Just give me the go-ahead and I'll flip the switch. Are you sure I'm allowed to be down here? Nope, so if you get caught, we don't know each other. Fischoeder:  Her bosom's mighty ample  Gayle:  He's just too hot to trample.  Okay, okay, stop right there. We're stopping? No. Yes. Ah, the theater. Should we fool around back here while we wait? Okay, just let me lick my lips. (moaning) Eh, never mind. Gene, what the heck is going on with the song? We made it into a love duet. What?! Hmm? The whole point of this is to get back at Mr. Dinkler. Or is it that against all odds, a lonely inventor and a down-on-her-luck elephant find true love? Oh, forget it! Let's just get to the pyro. Tina, stand on Teddy's yoga mat and don't move or it's... (buzzing) Are you sure this is safe? Teddy, tell Tina your yoga mat will keep her safe because it's rubber, over. Teddy: My... wait, who? Tina, she's standing on the yoga mat. So can we do this? (transmission cutting out) Okay, we can't hear you very well. So let's just go on my count. Three, two, one! (buzzing) My trunk! (all exclaiming) (sizzling) Wow. Wait till Mr. Dinkler hears about this. Wait till Mr. Dinkler sees this. Huh, huh, huh, huh. Well, I see your point. Huh, huh. It is a little dangerous. Huh, huh, huh, huh. Well, you don't have to do it. We can just use one of Gene's stuffed animals. I'm sure they're tired of being farted on. They love it. Huh, huh, huh, huh. Tina, people must know the truth. Do the reenactment. But what if I get electrocuted? Oh, come on, it's not that bad. But you died. Well, you don't have to rub it in. It's just, I'm not... What? Tina, tell my story. Also, you should wear your hair up sometimes, girlfriend. It looks really good. Okay, Topsy, I'll do it, but maybe not the hair thing. Oh, come on. It's just awkward with this length. Try it. See, I'm trying it right now. Look. You know what, wear it down. This is it. Today Edison and Dinkler are gonna get it right where the lightbulb don't shine. Are you sure you don't want music? Mm? No, no music, thank you. You had your chance and you blew it. Fine, then I quit! Suit yourself. Well, now I feel left out. Take me back. All right, you're rehired. Oh, thank God. Thank you. Teddy, what's our pyro status? Did you work out all the kinks? And by kinks I mean almost melting Tina. I think so, except for, uh... Nah, I'm sure it'll be fine. Huh, huh, huh. Tina, why are you making that noise? Huh, huh. Huh, huh. What is it, girl? Huh, huh. Oh, Tina's just pumped about the science fair. (whoops) Oh, wow, me, too. Is everybody ready to go? (bell jingles) Where's your father? Uh, here I am. What's all that? Uh, just some stuff I thought I'd bring to the science fair. (gasps) Are you bringing Spiceps? I just want some feedback, Lin. Who knows, maybe there's some wealthy parent that knows a good money-making venture when they see one. That's crazy. I'm going to get the Spice Rack. Oh, hello, Mr. Dinkler. What a day for science, huh? Teddy (over radio): Louise, give me the word when you want me to hit the switch. I know what you're doing, you hooligan. Jeremy saw everything last night. Oh, you son of a snitch! What's your favorite movie? Squeal Magnolias?! War Horse. You're trying to sully Edison's good name, and nobody messes with my man, Tom. You're banned. Get in there. You can't ban me from the science fair. So long, idiot. (chuckles) You're ruining my plan to humiliate you! Oh, oh-oh, oh. Whoop, oh, oopsie. Boy, that, uh, that fell over. Too bad. Aw. That's prime real estate. Watch out, someone's coming. Uh, uh, just checking out this great project. This must be a really smart kid, right? Not as smart as this kid right here; She's a genius. Oh, really? I think that kid stole this kid's idea and she should probably get a lawyer. Oh, he wouldn't dare. Oh, he would. I will destroy you. Hooray! Now that Louise is banned, I'm the only Edison project. Jeremy, shush. Right. Young man, I hear you wrote a love duet that dispels those nasty electrocution rumors and shows Edison's softer side. I think that's just what this science fair needs, and I want you to sing it. (gasps) Really? All right! What? I've got to call our landlord and my aunt and maybe some choir kids and maybe a couple of band geeks. If that's how you celebrate good news, sure. But, Gene, what about Louise? What about the truth? What did you say? I was just wondering if we need flutes. Who plays flute? Do you play flute? Teddy: Louise, some janitor just asked me what I was doing here. I panicked; I said I was a doctor. So if anyone asks, I'm Dr. Glen Wellness. I served in Korea. I handled a triage alone. Just if anyone asks. I delivered triplets in the back of a cab, if anyone asks. Ms. Schnurr, I want to say I totally understand why I'm in here. I was disrespectful. I was out of line, and oh, my God, did you move that picture? (screams) Wow. You are fast. I do martial arts. It shows. Hello, hi. Oh, aren't you short? Here, follow me. All right, let's show these people that if it ain't man-on-elephant love, it ain't worth singing about. (clears throat) Attention, everyone. We have a very special treat for you. It's a musical re-imagenactment of the very uplifting story of Thomas Edison and Topsy the elephant. Fischoeder:  They say Thomas Edison  He's the man to get us into this century  And that man is me  Gayle:  They'll say all... What's going on? Where's Louise? And why do Tina and Gene sound like Gayle and Mr. Fischoeder? It's science, Bob. You're not supposed to understand it. Okay. (screaming) Come on, Ms. Schnurr. Let me out of here. This is my destiny. Shh, I'm trying to eat this yogurt. Librarian: Toot, toot, here comes books. (gasps) Creepy librarian. Do I know you? You told me about Topsy. (whispering): I tell everyone about Topsy. So, here's the book you requested. Good stuff, chick lit. Oh, you've got to help me. Tell her I've got to go to the fair. Tell her I've got to take Dinkler down. Shh, leave me out of it. You started it. I start, I don't finish things. That's my one flaw. So, how's that yogurt? Fine! Forget you! Forget all of you! Eat your yogurt! I'm busting out! (yells) Louise: Get everything ready, Teddy, because this is happening. I'll get to the radio and when I say "hit it," you hit it with everything you've got. Capisce? Wait, don't leave me. Okay, everything's all right. You're Dr. Glen Wellness. You can handle anything. Hell, you got the highest MCATs in the state.  But I never noticed  The curve of her trunk  Gayle:  And I never noticed  His electric junk  We might just have found  Electric love  Electric love...  Wow, did Gene write this? God, I want what they have. It's so romantic.  Electric love  Electric love...  Fits like a glove.  This is what really happened, people. This man, Thomas Edison, sentenced Topsy, that beautiful elephant, to die by electrocution. (laughs) Uh-oh. Here's your hero, Dinkler. Hit it! Is that you, Louise? Hit it! I've been down here so long. What's it like out there? Are people still the same with their funny ways? Teddy, hit it! Oh, right, the thing we're doing. Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh. Oh! Tina! Tina! Tina? I'm okay. Oh! Oh, God. Oh, thank God. Tina. I thought we weren't doing the d*ath scene, but I saw the sparks and went with it. Was I convincing? Yes, very. Oh, my God, I almost electrocuted my sister. I've become Edison. Oh, you wish. So he electrocuted animals. (shocked murmuring) So what? As if everyone here is so perfect. (sobbing) (Fischoeder and Gayle moaning) Oh, got a little caught up in the moment. We're in love! We're a couple in love! It's really happening finally! Thank you, God! Got to go. Could have asked me to sing, but whatever. You know, I could've sung it. Louise, is there something you want to say to your sister? Tina, I'm sorry I nearly k*lled you. I got carried away with the Dinkler thing, which worked out pretty well, but still, I shouldn't have almost k*lled you. It's okay; This is how Topsy would have wanted it, but with more trampling people. And, Gene, I'm sorry to you, too. Your song was really good. I know, and without a single fart sound. Oh, my God, I forgot the fart sounds! How'd we do? Well, you almost k*lled my daughter. So yeah, not great. Oh, wow, sorry about that. Hey, did you check out that Spiceps thing? Cool, huh? Really? I thought so. Yeah. Since Mr. Dinkler is in the bathroom, crying, I'm stepping in to announce the science fair winners. Second lace goes to "How Many Hairs Up There?", by Andy and Ollie Pesto. Oh, my God! I want to thank Ollie. I want to thank Andy. I want to thank Ollie. I want to thank Andy. That got second? That's ridiculous. And the blue ribbon goes to "Spice..." uh, I can't read this. Spice Rack! Spice Rack! Spiceps, Spiceps! Spice Rack! Spiceps! Spiceps! Ow! Rack!  Electric love  Electric love  Electric love 
Open up, babies. Time for breakfast. Who wants Mommy's sausage? (chewing loudly) None for me, thanks. No sausage? What's wrong, sweetie? Today's the day I'm going to ask Jimmy Jr. to the dance. I don't want sausage sweats. Why? I'm wearing my sausage sweats right now. Aw, my baby's going to her first school dance. It's not that big a deal. I never went to a school dance. What? You never went to a school dance? No, I had other things to do. Like what, Dad? Well, I did leather-tooling. I made a belt. Somebody change the subject, somebody change the subject! Hey, I'm fine with it. I didn't miss out on dances. Those other kids missed out on leather. Aw, Bobby. That's what I love about you: all your sad stories. It's not sad. Hush, you're scaring Tina. Put that out of your head before you ask Jimmy Jr. Happy thoughts, happy thoughts. Leather belts. Sausage. Sausage belts. That's a great idea. (school bell ringing) Hi, Jimmy Jr. Oh, hey, Tina. Did you see those two squirrels fighting in the courtyard? Hey, speaking of the dance, are you planning on going? Am I going to the dance? Does this answer your question? Pyeah! Oh, that must be dancing for "yes." Yeah. Then, would you like to go to the dance with me? Uh, the best I can do now is a maybe. I want to know what all my options are first. That makes sense. Yeah, it does. Because, why tie yourself down now? Yeah. You know, you want to know all the girls that might be interested so you could weigh... Right. the pro... weigh them against each other. Okay, see you later. Okay, bye. Hey, Tina. Yeah? Ch-ah. What's that dancing for? Just... your skirt's stuck in your underwear. Oh, thanks for telling me. All right, fix it. Okay.  I'm gonna live forever  I'm gonna learn how to fly...  Oh, my God. Tina? Josh? What are you doing here? I'm here for school. This is homework for my street performance class. Wow. I go to the performing arts high school. I dance ballet. Oh, a bad boy. Cool. Who's this? I hope she's not another Toe 'Ho. A what Douglas. A dance groupie. These hangers-on, they really sap your energy. No, Douglas, this is Tina. I never thought I'd see her again. Oh, great. Hey, hey, Josh. I have to do a minute of handstands for extra credit. Can you time me? No, I'm-I'm kind of busy right now. I guess I'll just time myself, then. One, two, three, four, five, six... I haven't seen you since... Douglas, you got to stop, buddy, okay? Okay. I'm so sorry, Tina. What were you saying? I haven't seen you since... Since we kissed. On either side of the dairy case at Fresh Feed. It was hot. And cold. Why didn't you call me? No, I wrote down your number, but I put it in my dance pants and it got all sweaty. Dance pants. Yeah. Never put anything down dance pants. Mmm. Hey, I was just thinking, our school dance is Saturday. Will you come with me? Don't you want to know what your other options are? No, silly, I want to go with you. Well, that sounds fun, but my school dance is on Saturday, too, and today I got a soft maybe from a boy I asked. So... I'll have to let you know? That's totally fair. Here's my number. Oops, I lost it. (laughs) I know you're kidding. Yep, that's our chemistry. It sure is. Really cool chemistry, too. Douglas, please! Oh, I recognize that look. Somebody's going to the dance with Jimmy Jr. Yes, and it might be me. Jimmy Jr. gave me a maybe. All right! That's my little maybe baby. You're gonna be the prettiest girl at the dance, maybe. Just a maybe? When's he gonna give you a solid answer? Soon, I hope. Because Josh asked me to go to his school dance, too. Well, that's great. Go with the kid who's not stringing you along. Remember, Tina, a nerd in the hand is worth... not really that much, actually. Never mind. A yes is better than a maybe, sweetie. Don't end up like your father. Uh, what? Don't end up like your father. I guess you're right. But, I've logged over 3,000 fantasy hours on my relationship with Jimmy Jr. You don't just throw that away. (phone ringing) Bob's Burgers. Hello? We can do it? Yay. Oh, how exciting. No teens are gonna get pregnant on our watch. (laughs) I'll see you Saturday. Uh, what was all that? Get ready to shake it, Bobby. We're gonna chaperone Tina's dance. Narc! Chaperone? That's a horrible idea. Dad, your first dance. We can get ready together. Yeah, you can zip each other up. Uh... Hi, Jimmy Jr. I was wondering if you've decided who you're going to the dance with. Uh, no offense, Tina, but you're pressuring me right now, and guys don't like that. Well, then, maybe I'll go with the other boy who asked me. Wha...? Another boy? Oh, uh... I just decided. I'll go with you. Wait, you just decided you'll go with me because you found out this other boy wants to? (scoffs) That has nothing to do with it. Who is it? Lenny? No. I mean, he's good-looking, but he's not that good-looking. Plus, looks fade. It's not Lenny. Was it Nate? No. 'Cause he has herpes. So you're saying you want to go with me? Yes. And Josh wants to go with me. Choose me, Tina. I asked you first. But you asked me first. We've got chemistry. I've got a butt. Look at it. I asked you and only you. As far as you know. What? He said, "As far as you know." No, I didn't. You said it. Don't worry about who said it. Just watch the butt. Jimmy Jr., I just decided. I'm going to the dance with... Josh. (sighs) Well, would you at least think about changing your mind? As a handsome dancer once said, "Maybe." You're-you're the handsome dancer. Jimmy Jr. had a chance to hitch his trailer to the Tina truck, but now it's headed down the highway to Joshville. Honk, honk. Two boys like Tina at the same time? And one of them's not even papier-matcher, like Roberto was. What happened to Roberto? Did you try to shower with him? Yeah. Maybe. Well, good for you, Tina. When I see Jimmy Jr. at the dance on Saturday, I'm gonna tell him, "Go do your 'you had your chance dance,' buddy." Wait-wait a minute. Now we're chaperoning a dance Tina's not even going to? We're not doing it for her, Bobby. We're doing it for you. I really wish we weren't doing it for me. Oh, wake up, we do everything for you. Dad, if you believe you're beautiful, you will be. I did. But maybe we can do something about that hair. Did you wash it? Walk home with us, Tina. There's just something about your smell that keeps the mean dogs away. Not today. Josh is coming to pick me up. Louise (laughing): Tights. Tina, is he a superhero? Hey, Tina. Hey, Josh. So, I'm here to pick you up. Whoa, careful! Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Get it? I literally picked you up. It was like being on a romantic stool. Yeah, well, that was just a stool sample. There's more where that came from. Ten bucks says you can't lift Gene. Toss me into a tree, then tell everyone I climbed it myself like a normal boy. Wait, wait, wait. Pick me up, pick me up. Here we go. Put me down! Put me down! Okay, now, now you're down! And now you're down. That was cool. (scoffs) Lifting a girl. Big deal. I'm sorry. You are? Better than you. And what? This is Jimmy Jr., the other boy who asked me to a dance. This is Josh, the other boy who asked me to a dance. I'm Zeke. I'm going stag. So you dance, huh? On those twigs? (laughing): You just got J-Ju-ed. Whoa, guys, slow down. Is this really worth it? (moans) Come on, Tina. We've got reservations at a frozen yogurt stand. Ha, can't afford regular yogurt. I can't believe Tina found another dancer. She's rubbing that guy's feet in my face. Uh-oh. Somebody's as jealous as a bald guy in a mop factory. I'm not jealous, Zeke. I just don't! Like! That guy! Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Calm down, now. You want her back, we'll get her back. You think so, Zeke? I don't know, but maybe. Well, you just said... Oh, just trust me! Well, well... Kind of. It's so hard when two boys want you. You seem to be kind of enjoying all this attention, Tina. Come on, Bob. Tina had a long wait till she got to the buffet. Let her pig out. I'm just saying, you shouldn't string boys along. It's not right. You can't just tell a boy on the steps of Buchanan Middle Schoo 30 years ago that you're not going to the dance with him when you said you would. Whoa. What happened, Bob? Yeah, Dad, open that wound. Let's poke around in there. All right, all right. Bob: I was 13, and I just spent my allowance on a corsage. Gene: Idiot. Hey, Becky. I got you this corsage. It goes really nice with your... other corsage? Yeah, Curt gave it to me. Hey. Oh, hey, Curt. 'Sup? Sorry, I didn't know how to tell you. I thought this would be easiest. Yeah, yeah, this is, um... this is really easy, Becky. Thanks. Oh, well. I'll see you inside. Great belt. Great neck. What'd you say? Uh... nothing. Curt: Yeah, that's what I thought. Your fly's down. No, it isn't. (blows raspberry, laughs) Oh, got me. Yep. Is this stuff really important to the story, Dad? Aw, Bobby. That settles it. We're gonna make up for that awful, terrible night and all your other missed dances, Bobby. That's not why I told the story, Lin. This is gonna be the biggest, glitziest, Bobby-est school dance ever. And if there's a chaperone king, it's gonna be you. There's no such thing as a chaperone king. Well, there wasn't a raccoon king in our alley until I went out there and picked my favorite one. (laughs) His name's Little King Trash Mouth. He's gay. He's gay? Yeah. Why? He's got a boyfriend. They just got married. Hmm. Wha...? (mumbling) All right, J-Ju, get your net ready. We're about to hook us a trout called Tina. Hey, Tina. Hi, Jimmy Jr. What's up, girl? (grunting) I got you! I got you! (grunting) Come on! Uh-oh, J-Ju's starting to rally. Oh, he beat me. Oh, look at this boy. Look at that r-raging testosterone just throbbing out of him. (screaming) Ah, yeah. How you like my boy now, lady? Ah, I got mad. My main man's a crazy man. I know what you're doing, Jimmy Jr. You're trying to get me to go to the dance with you. Well, try again. I mean it, try again. Um... right now? No, later. Just do something without Zeke. Well, if that didn't work, nothing will. Sorry, J-Ju. Now let's finish what we started! No, Zeke! Ow! You little son of a b1tch! Hey, guys has, um... Tina been talking about me at all? Um, no. Tough break, Jr. Tough break. Hey, will you guys help me get her back? We'll help you, for a price. Can you really put a price on love? Yes, you can. It's $20. Okay, just tell me what to do, and I'll do it. Anything. Hey, but don't let Tina know. Jimmy Jr., please. We are professional and discreet. We would never tell her. Hey, Tina, Jimmy Jr. just hired us to help win you back. He did? That is the sleaziest, sneakiest, most romantic thing I've ever heard. Great. Can we quote you on that for our Web site? And could you make us a Web site? Operation Squash Josh a go. Take your positions. Jimmy Jr.: Hi, Tina. Wow, a horse. That's me, Jimmy Jr. What are you doing in there? Say, "I love you more than hay!" Say, "I love you. Hey!" I love hay. Oh, that's nice. 'Cause you're a horse. Say, "Saddle up for love." Satellite above! Seattle has drugs. Oh, that's where they have drugs. It's going great! Hit her with the song. Cue the tune, lover boy.  "T" is for the way  You take my breath away  "I" is for  The way I like it  When you take my breath away  "N" is for no one else takes my breath away  And "A" is for asthma  That is a disease  That takes people's breath away.  That was amazing. Score. You did it. Yeah. High-five all around. This is going good. Hey, Tina. What's with the horse? Jimmy Jr. dressed up like a horse to surprise me. Yeah, I know what Tina wants. And, oh, by the way, I kissed her. I kissed her, too. Well, I kissed her first. And you kissed her worst. Guys, you both have kissed me. It's true. And I appreciate you dressing up as the most magical non-magical animal there is. But I want to go to Josh's dance. With Josh. That's me. Ugh. When you tell me no, it makes me want you more! Oh, no. Aah! No. Aah! No. Aah! I thought you knew how to seduce your sister. Wait, that's what we're doing? Be patient. Come on, it takes extra time to get through those extra thick glasses. Plus she's a teenager and they're so fickle. Louise: Why do we have to get a stupid babysitter? What did I say about using that word? You're not stupid, Jen. I know. I brought this puzzle for the kids to do. Oh, look, it's nails all twisted up. I'm not saying it's unsolvable, but it's probably unsolvable. It's like the Ruben's Cube of nails. Yeah, that looks great, Jen. Oh-ho-ho... (gasps) Done! Oh, my God. What else you got? Uh... we could look at my hand. One of my fingers... I got it caught in a leaf blower. And so the knuckle didn't grow. Oh, look at the hand. Wow. That's great. Thank you. (door opens) (gasps) Ta-da. Linda: Oh, my God, it's like a fairy tale! What a couple of sexy beasts! (sighs) (growls) Can we just go? Hi, Jen. Not before I get a picture, you can't. Come on, you two, get together. Hmm. Say, "Romance." Romance. Romance. Romance! (horn honking) Tina, your ride is here! And, uh... oh, what's this, Bobby? Our ride is here, too! Look! I told the guy at the limo place your sad story, and he gave us a discount. I'm staying home. No, you're not. Come on, I want to stand up in the sun roof and yell bwah! Right? Yup.    I'm a little nervous. I know, there's a lot of talent in this room. Hey, remember to stretch, you two. Or else you might get hurt doing this... Ha! Don't worry, Douglas. I won't be doing that. No, I know you won't, sweetheart. I like this song. So do I. Maybe we could like it on the dance floor. Just think of me as your Nutcracker. Sorry, that's the only ballet I know. What about the lipcracker...? Is that a real ballet, or are you asking me to kiss? Both. JIMMY JR. Put the lips down! Jimmy Jr.? I came to fight for you, Tina. Like fight-fight? No. I'm challenging you to a dance-off! (gasps) Oh, my God, a real dance-off! My idea. And you're welcome. A pants off? For me? Uh, no, a dance-off. Oh. That's almost as good. (grunting) Do Mom and Dad know you're here? I didn't know what to do with them. They solved the puzzle. I didn't bring any backup puzzles. Yeah, we stared at a knuckle-less finger for about 20 minutes. Uh, Tina, eyes on me. I'm winning you back. Right, sorry. So You Think You Can Dance called. They said, "You can't." Oh! (laughs) Did you, uh... learn that joke at the School for Performing Farts? (laughs) These are the best insults about dancing I ever heard! (yelling) (sighs) I don't ever want to leave this limo. Oh, come on, you little wallflower. I'm gonna pick you. Gonna pluck your little petals. Da-da-da-du! All right, I'm coming. (slow music playing) Mr. and Mrs. Belcher. You are our best-dressed chaperones. Aw, thank you, Miss Jacobson. It's my Bobby's first dance. Uh, first dance as a chaperone. Oh. I've been to dances before. Of course. If you'll excuse me... Hands where I can see 'em! Ooh, Miss Jacobson's a looker, isn't she? You're telling me. Why is she a teacher? She should be, like, playing a teacher on TV. All right. That's enough. Bob: I'm just saying, I just... Yeah. She's, um... ridiculously attractive. Enough! Guys, Jimmy Jr. called the dance-off, so he's gonna go first. No moves are forbidden, except "The Forbidden Move"! Good luck to both of you. And don't be self-conscious if you start sweating a lot, and your shirt sticks to your chest and your abs. Thanks, Tina. Thanks, Tina. DJ? Cue up something that rocks! Yeah!  Okay, there. We danced, all right? I-I got the middle school dance experience I never had. Thank you, Lin. One dance? Bobby, you didn't even move your feet. You're still not getting into the spirit. Look, we have a responsibility. We're chaperones. I saw a kid lick another kid's eyeball. Seems like something we should get him in trouble for. Wait, wait, wait, wait, Bobby. Uh, I'm sorry I blew my lid about Miss Jacobson. Hey. Hi. Hi. Hi. It's fine. It's just, you know, she-she really is a hottie. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. I bet if she asked you to dance, you'd take another spin. Wouldn't you? Wouldn't you? No. No. I... No. I would not be interested. Go on, say it. Say you'd rather dance with her! I-I... Wh... I... Say it! This is for you! There! (sobs) Linda. What the hell? (upbeat dance music playing) (grunts) Cut the fog, man! Cut the fog! (music stops, cheers and applause) (shouts) (shouts) Yeah! Douglas, what do you think? Take it slow or go rough? Josh, you be as nasty as you need to be. Yes, nasty. DJ, my music. (classical music plays) (quietly muttering) Wow, he looks like a lion murdering a cloud. I know. Isn't it beautiful? (Linda sobbing) Linda? What's wrong with you? What are you doing in there? We just... I'm talking to my girlfriends! Oh. Go away, Bob! You want to dance with Miss Jacobson! You think she's prettier than me. Yes, she's hot, but it doesn't matter. Who cares? Look, I-I'm going to go back out to the dance and pretend none of this is happening because you're acting like a middle schooler, Linda, and I am, uh... Oh... Gotcha! So that was just so... So you could have a little drama. It's your middle school dance. What, did you think these things are fun? Come on. (chuckles) You are definitely nuts. But now you're more in the spirit, right? You got some more dance in your pants, don't you? Ooh. Come on. I don't. No. That... I don't know. (stutters, chuckles) Stop. Come on, this might help right here. I brought some schnapps. Here? We'll get in trouble, Lin. That's right. (coughs) That's bad. That is really bad. Oh, my Go... oh, my God, it just got good. Look. You brought two? Double-fist it. Double-fist it. I'm not mixing peach and mint. (classical music playing) (grunts) Mmm. And with great dignity, the swan... dies. (exhales) (music stops) (sobbing): Why did I not bring any roses to toss? I should always carry roses! This isn't over! Lightning round! DJ, kick it! (upbeat dance song plays) (grunts) (grunts) ("Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy" plays) (upbeat dance song plays) (both songs remixed play) Here I am. No, I'm not. Here I am. No, I'm not. Here I am. No, I'm not. (both grunting) Stop. Turn off the music. Someone's gonna get hurt. (grunting) I can't choose. (both panting) Maybe I don't have to choose. (sultry music begins playing) We can make this work. We'll come up with a make-out wheel. Kind of like a chore wheel. Uh, I don't want to do this. Yeah, me, neither. Give it a chance. Let's put the "try" in "triangle." Um, no, thanks. Talk to you later, okay? Tonight was really fun. Until all of this. This was a mess. Oh. Yeah, um, I kind of forgot what I was even doing here. Well, we have a draw, but we also have a loser. Which would, of course, be you, Tina. If you ever go back to being a one-boy girl, you know where to find me. And, hey, Jimmy Jr., you got some great moves. You thinking what I'm thinking? Let's do this. (upbeat dance music playing, both grunting) Oh, yeah, girl! We got ourselves a dance on! Too bad, T. (sighs) I got greedy and grabby. But I had two boys fighting over me. I'm thankful for that. Sorry you weren't able to make Jimmy Jr. and Josh your sister-wives. Hey, maybe next dance. You flew too close to the buns. (clears throat) Watch the hands. Um, Mr. and Mrs. Belcher? Hi. I'm gonna have to ask you to tone it down a little bit. Oh, you mean tone it down like this? Whoop! No. That is not what I mean. Hmm. This is completely inappropriate behavior. (slurring): Bobby's first dance! (retches) Oh, my God. Oh, Lin. Oh, the schnapps. Oh, Lin. (gags) Oh, it tastes like peach. (laughs) Oh, man. That's all over me. Ah, I got to take my shirt off. I'm gonna... I'm gonna lose it, too! Can I get a little help over here? I'm gonna lose it! All right, these two, out. Right here. Ooh, you're even prettier when you're angry, little lady. I got it! I got it! You're not security. You're friends with Tina. Hey. Get your hands off me. What? Hey! These two. Get 'em out. Get your hands off me, little guy.  "T" is for the way you take my breath away  "I" is for the way I like it when you take my breath away  "N" is for no one else takes my breath away  And "A" is for asthma that is a disease  That takes people's breath away!  Oh, that's nice. 'Cause you're a horse.
 Going to Florida  Going to Florida  Sunshiney, Florida  Now-ow  Going to Florida  Florida, Florida  Everyone's going somehow.  Great song, Mom. Ugh. Hey, sourpuss. What are you gonna do, stay here and work? The restaurant's being fumigated. It's the perfect time to go down and see my parent's new condo. Ugh, I'd rather let a fumigator spray poison in my mouth than stay with your parents. Bobby, stop it. No, they're nice. Florida's our most penis-shaped state. Who's your geography teacher? Mr. Ding-Dong. I'm just thinking about that pool. Oh, man. Pool, pool, pool. Tina: I'm gonna go down the slide. Whoo. I went down backwards. No, I didn't. Well, I'm glad you kids are excited, because I am going to k*ll myself. Bob. Yes! Enough. My parents are gonna be so excited to see their little grandbabies. And we are gonna be excited to see them. Tina: Yay! Linda:  Going to Florida, tropical Florida  (Gene makes fart noise) Louise: Hey! Bob: Gene! Oh, crap. Hey!  Manatees Florida, now.  Gloria: You really didn't have to come all this way. Of course we did. Well, it's done. So, you know, you're here, so... So, uh, how are you enjoying the place, Al? Eh, fah. Oh, we're still adjusting. What am I looking at over there in leopard-print tights? A leopard? (mumbling): I've told them a hundred times. Oh, that's Helen Kellerman. She's nuts. Okay, great story, Grandma. Uh, you still got it. Love you, miss you, and where's the pool? Tina: Ear infection, here we come. Okay, go have fun. (trunk closing) (screams) Sorry, Gloria. I guess you've still got that thing about loud noises. So, what's the plan? What should we do? Well, tonight, Al and I are supposed to go to a potluck, but, uh... Hey, we could all go. No! I mean, you don't want to go to that. Potluck? There's so many other fun things to do around here: Mahjongg. Yeah. No. Chinese checkers. No. Yeah, yeah. Boccie. (gasps) Oh, boccie. No. Backgammon. No. Mahjongg. Oh. You said that. I don't remember saying mahjongg. You did, you said it first. Wine tasting. That. Let's do that. As... Ooh, yay, wine. As soon as we can, right? (whooping) Can we go taste wine now? Uh, I've never peed in an Olympic-size pool. I'm a little nervous about going for the gold. Relax, Gene. This is where all those years of training pay off. Mm. "Closed for cleaning"? (all gasping) No! Okay, okay, okay, calm down, calm down. We can fill it. There's a drinking fountain. Okay, we just... we need a bucket. Where are the buckets? Forget the bucket, just spit. (Louise shouting frantically) My mouth's dry. Tina, give me some of your spit. You missed. Try again. Louise: Oh, no! No, no, no! (crying): Oh, no, no! Our trip is ruined. I used all my vacation days for this! Now what? I'm not gonna sit and watch the sunset or whatever these people do. I say we go to Cuba. We've got the floaties. I've always wanted to see the Bay Of Pigs. Sounds cute. Hey, look, it's the crazy leopard lady. (playing harmonica)  My Bitsy...  (humming) Wow, that's bewitching. It's for my dead dog, Bitsy. He used to love the sound of this thing. I used to love it, too. How'd Bitsy die? Python ate him. There's pythons in Florida? They didn't mention that in the brochure. Oh, we got everything here. Pythons, panthers, predatory stink bugs. (whimpers) Yup, that's everything. How do you know your dog got eaten by a python? Did it leave a note? Two weeks ago, I saw my little Bitsy go into these woods. Then I saw the python in there. You do the math. Ah, no thanks. We're on vacation. You do the math. You do it. (light Afro-Cuban music) (slurping) Wow, the red pairs nicely with the white. Look at all these active seniors. I can't wait to get old and move down here myself. Lin, there's something you should know. Now don't get upset. What? What happened? Uh, this place is kind of special. Fah. I can see that. The seniors are active. Very active. Yeah, I said that already. I mean, like adventurous. Uh. (blows raspberry) Yeah, okay. Okay. Ah. I got one. Ah... Hmm? (laughing giddily) Oh, my God, Lin. These people are swingers. What, like-like dancers? No. No. Like golfers? Uh-uh. No. (gasping) Yeah. Wha, wha, wha, wha, swi... What? Huh? Oh. (gagging) I'm sorry about Bitsy. Is this him? (whistles) He was a snazzy dresser. Wait, how big was this snake? At least ten feet. Ten feet of snake? In there? Oh, he'd put the squeeze on you. Oh... I told the condo association get rid of it. They don't believe me. But that snake's in there, and it's a k*ller, and I'm gonna prove it. That's why I got this. The only problem is, I don't walk so well. (gasping) You kids could go in there. I'll pay ya. What?! No! Gene, let Helen speak. Well, what would you say to a $100? Oh, my God! No. Yes. Yes! But you've got to get it on there. No proof, no money. No. For a hundred bucks, we will get that thing on tape. No. Cheating on his wife. No. Taking bribes. No. Uh, shoplifting from a snake mall. No. Uh, giving up on his dreams. No. We're going to get it all! Since the first Burmese pythons were released in Florida, these voracious predators have spread from the panhandle to the Everglades. So Helen's not crazy. At least not about this. They eat rabbits, raccoons, small dogs, even deer. I'm too young to be an outline in a snake's belly! Gene, get a grip! (yells) We're talking about a hundred dollars. You once licked a slug for a bite of a granola bar. Slugs go well with granola! Don't worry, Gene. As long as we stick together, the snake can't swallow all of us. Speaking of sticking together, how about I don't go with you? I'll stay at base camp. I'll be the guy who's, uh... good with computers. Call me... Circuit Breaker. I'm not calling you that. I really think you should, because, um, I'm hacking into the mainframe. Oh, oh, encryption. Ha, ha. Right around ya. And, oh... Activate spellcheck. Go. I'm in! What about those two? Yes. Wow. Ugh. How about, uh, Earlobes and uh, Back Hair? Don't tell me they're into it. You don't want to know how into it they are. That is unbelievable. Oh, it's not funny, Bob. It's gross. No, Lin, it's really funny. Ma, this is wh... Why would you want to do that? Why would you want to live here? (gagging) Because the other places were horrible! Old people waiting to die. This place, the people are alive. They're really alive. (laughing): That's amazing. Stop it! We thought, if swinging is part of it, why not give it a try? Then we moved here, and your father got cold feet. Good for your feet, Dad. Eh? It's not good! It's not good, Al! No! (mutters) Can I have a graham cracker, Helen? Get your own. You know, we could become professional python bounty hunters. We could move here and start our own reality TV show. We could call it Snake it to the Limit. Or So You Think You Can Snake. Or Snake and Bake, if we baked the snake after we caught it. Hey, I'm paying you kids to track, not yak. Hey, don't get your tights in a bunch, Helen. We're gonna find that snake. See ya, Gene. Can I have some melon? No. (grunts) (animals chittering) There must be millions of places in here where that snake could hide. Okay, maybe not millions. Let's try that again. Florida's weird. What's going on? You just left. Ugh. Let us work, Helen! Then work! We're working! God! (grunts) Ow. Ha! You missed! Yeah, you missed. Wait. Ugh. I don't want all these old horny toads anywhere near my parents. I can't believe they got mixed up in all this. Easy, Lin. Your parents are adults. It's really none of our business. I'm telling everybody when we get home. Ugh! I can't get the image out of my mind. A bunch of naked old people all in a... yuck, naked. Oh, hi, kids! Hey. All in a what? Uh... look, over there! What? I got you. (laughs) Huh. Go to bed. All of you. Bed now. Actually, we were thinking we'd camp out tonight in the parking lot by the woods. Grandpa Al said we could use his tent. Huh? In the parking lot? Away from this? That's great! Yeah, great! But if anyone invites you to a potluck, run away. There's a potluck?! You would not like it. Really? What do you mean? It's hard to explain why you wouldn't like it. Well, give me some ideas. I love the idea of everyone bringing a dish. Linda: Oh, God! Don't do it while we're here, please! Ugh! Oh! Linda, we've been served with a Notice of Failure to Perform. What? Failure? W-Why? Wha...? Your parents RSVP'd "no" to the potluck. It's clear they have no intention of taking part fully in the activities here. And those who don't play can't stay. Eh. They can't? Tonight's potluck was their third strike. They also missed the Best Ball golf outing and the South of the Border fish taco night. Ugh! Oh! Wait. So you're kicking them out for not going to your parties? You can do that? It's in our bylaws, large print edition. You've got to be part of the community. Well, these pots are keeping their lids on! Stay away from their beef and noodles! (sighs) I'm going to bed. I hope you're better at finding snakes than pitching tents, because you stink. Well, I hope you're good at finding your purse and ponying up that hundred bucks. I got the money. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah! Yeah?! Let me see it! Hey, don't you worry. I'm good for it. Just put ten dollars in my hand. Good night. Good night, Helen. Sweet dreams, okay? I love you, Helen! And I love your money! Uh, it's getting dark. I better go in the tent and do base camp stuff. (Gene yelling) Oh, no! The tent's running away. Oh, get back here with base camp, Gene! I don't want to! Helen said she'll get you crackers! Helen: No, I didn't! Oh, go to bed, already! Linda: Don't you worry, Mom. I'm sure you and Dad can find a nice retirement community. One where a porch swing is something you sit on and not strap into. I sat on that. It was weird. We won't be able to afford to live in a retirement community. Or even an apartment. (sighs) What? Why? Why? If we get kicked out, we'll have to forfeit our down payment. (gasps) No. Well, you know what I'm thinking. No, no. You could always... No, no, no. No. ...move in... No, no. ...with us. (yelling) No! Gene: What kind of animal was that? Stop being scared, okay? You're gonna spook Tina. I'm not spooked. What's the thing after spooked? I'm that. Wait, wait! Let's all stay in the tent. Let's order tent service! I'll get... Ooh. Ooh, this is hard. I'll get the Cobb salad and... What do you guys want? Okay, I'll just put you down for some spicy wings and, like, a dill salmon. What else? Guys! Guys! (Tina shouts) Shh! Did you say "shh"? Or did the snake say "sss"? (rustling) What was that? (Tina shouts) Aah! Qu-Quit shining the light in my eyes! Whoops. I think something's on me. Is there something on me? Uh, yes. It's either a feather or a scorpion. (shouting) Get it off! Tina, stop! Stop! I'll get it! No, no, no, no, no! Now I can't see the scorpion! (shouts) Drop and roll! Drop and roll! (shouts) Maybe it was a feather. Just think feather. I hate feathers. Bob: Oh, God. Oh. Oh, stop it. Oh, no. If they need a place to live they will live with us, Bob! Case closed! Well, why can't they live with your sister? Her life is already ruined. Gayle has a studio apartment. We have three kids and one bathroom. Not another word, Bob. If they get kicked out of here, then they are staying with us. Well, then they are not going to get kicked out of here. What? Bob, Excuse me. Bob, where are you going? Nowhere. What are you doing? Nothing. Bob. (sighs) Sheesh. Bye. Louise: Snake-hunter to Snake-wuss. Over. Snake-wuss to... Hey. We're lost, our flashlights are gone and we can't find our way out of the woods, which is possibly full of scorpions... or feathers. Over. Follow the sound of my voice! It's on the walkie-talkie, Gene. Then follow your heart. You can't go wrong! Shush! Just shush! Tina, let's think. Is there such a thing as night butterflies? Please say yes. (both shouting) Tina: It could still be butterflies. No, they're not. Hi, Al. Eh. Bob: Looks like a pretty fun party. (groans) I mean, look, all you got to do is show up, right? And then they'll let you stay. Show up and... and play. Well, yeah, but, you know, that's why you came here, right? I mean, you must have been excited about it at some point. What-what happened? I saw all these other fellas. They're just a bunch of... peacocks. Mmm. Oh. Y-You don't want to be the last breadstick in the basket, huh? Ah. (sputters) There's, uh... breadstick pills, you know? Doc won't let me take those pills. Bad heart... and kidney... liver... Right. And leg pains and dry mouth. W-Well, what else gets you going? Is there anything you're into? Like, uh... I don't know... uh, feet or something? (groans) Leather? (groans) Spanking? Eh. Um, I don't really know any others. Well, there's one thing. Gloria doesn't know. What? What-what is it? Eh. F-Forget it. You can tell me, Al. (mumbling): Balloons. What? Balloons! Um, that's great. I... Wait. What is that? I like... to watch a woman inflate a balloon and then sit on it till it pops. It drives me cra-crazy. No, that's... I mean, that's what you're into. Yeah, but Gloria hates loud noises. It'd never work. Uh, does it have to pop? Yes! Pop! Pop! Yes! What... Where'd-where'd you see that first? World Wide Web. Uh-huh. Uh, I've... I'll have to, um... I'll check it out. You just... You just, uh... www-dot... Mm-hmm. Women-inflates-a-balloon-and- sits-on-it-and-pops-it-dot-com. Yeah. Catchy name. (groans) How are we still in here? This is the tiniest forest in the world! All of a sudden I feel slower. And shorter. We're in a mud hole. That's it! I hate Florida! Gene, come help us! We're gonna drown in mud if the snake doesn't eat us first. I don't believe you. Send me a picture of you in the mud holding today's newspaper. Until you do, I am turning off the walkie-talkie. Gene, don't do it! Don't do it! He did it. You're dead to me, Gene! And we'll be dead, too, so it's complicated. Help! Help! Louise: Help! Help! (Tina yells)  I'm not afraid of ghosts  I'm not afraid of sharks  I'm not afraid of cancer  I'm just afraid of snakes  They really creep me out  Where are their arms and legs?  It's not okay!    I don't think Gene's coming. Less thinking, more screaming! (shouts) Louder! I can't, but I'll add gestures. (shouting) Louise: Oh, God! No wonder they had to clean the pool. Dirty old ducks. (upbeat party music plays)  Dirty ducks  Dirty ducks.  Dirty ducks.  Quack, quack. (disgusted sounds) Hi, Gloria. (shouts) Oh, sorry. Sorry to startle you. I know that's your thing. Okay. So, uh... so, what are you doing? Dishes? Yeah. I guess I'm gonna have to pack this place up. Well, actually, maybe not. Guess who's been talking to Al about s*x parties? Who? This guy. And guess who found out Al's secret kink that even you didn't know about? Who? Me. I did. Right here. What is it? Well, the answer may startle you. Literally. Do you have any earplugs or headphones? And balloons? Huh? And something to share, 'cause it's a potluck. So we should whip something up. What do you got in the fridge? Uh... Can't hold on much longer. Tina, help me record my last will and testament. If you're watching this, I'm dead. And I only have a few things to say. Don't touch my stuff! No one gets anything! I leave it all to my ghost! (whirring in distance) What the hell is that? (shouting) (thud) Gene, you came! Quick. Grab this. (all grunting) You saved us, Gene. I owe you my life. No, thanks. I've seen it, and I'm not impressed. Yellow Belly! Gene! Your belly's not as yellow as I thought. What happened? I didn't want to be an only child. They're always weird. Gene mowed us a path. Drive us out of here. (snarling) (all shouting) (all panting) I hate Florida. I hate Florida. I hate it, I hate it, I hate it. Louise: Wh. Look. Bitsy's tutu. Ah. Yeesh. This must be the place the snake comes to digest its prey. (rustling) (all shout) (bark) (barking) (panting, barks) It's Bitsy! He passed right through the snake without being digested! Like that time I swallowed a button! This button. (barks) Where are my parents? Um, getting ready for the party. What?! Al: Wha...? What is going on? (gags) What?! Go! Go, you two. Have fun. Okay. What?! Okay, bye! Al: Eh. We're going now! Bye-bye. Al: Thank you, Bob. No problem, Al. Oh, no. I wasn't talking to you. (chuckling): Oh. Bob, you tell me what is happening right now. Al finally got into the swing of things. They're going to the party, which means they won't be kicked out, which means I'm a hero. Oh, you're a hero 'cause you got my parents to go to a s*x party?! Well, maybe not a hero, but, uh, eh. Great, so they get to stay here and get passed around like hors d'oeuvres?! With crabs! In their crotches! Linda, look at them. (moaning, smacking) Oh, my God. They haven't kissed each other in 20 years. Ooh, it shows. I'm sure they'll get better at it. Huh. I guess if you love something, you let it go swing. What's with the balloons? Oh, it's a long story. Actually, I kind of want to try something. Does this do anything for you? (balloon pops) Ooh! Maybe... Louise: Well, I guess the only python was in Helen's head. "Snakes on a brain." Am I right? Yes, you are correct! I can hardly wait to see the look on Helen's face when we reunite her with Bitsy. (doorbell rings) Oh, you again. What do you got? Get your purse out, Helen. Better yet, go to the bank and open up your safe... we've got good news. You got the snake? Better. (barking) Bitsy! (laughing, kissing) Oh, what happened to your clothes? Let's get you into your big-dog pants. (barks) Come back! (barking) Bitsy! Maybe he doesn't like wearing clothes. With that body, I wouldn't either. (growls) Helen: Bitsy! Oh, man. We're never gonna get our hundred bucks now. Bitsy! (crying) Bitsy seemed really happy in there, if it makes you feel any better. Oh, yeah? (crying) Uh, Bitsy! Whatever you want to do, I support you! Bitsy, listen! Your favorite!  My little Bitsy baby  Bitsy  Bitsy  Bitsy  Oh, my Bitsy, baby  Bitsy, I'm gonna miss ya, my Bitsy  Bitsy!  Gene and Tina: Bye! Louise: Bye! Good-bye forever maybe! Bye, Ma! Bye, Dad! We'll never forget it. Can we come back sometime when they're not cleaning the pool? No. Never. Absolutely not. Not a chance in hell. Who were those people eating breakfast with Gram and Gramps this morning? Yeah. Oh, those were the Madisons. Well, why was Mr. Madison sitting on Gram-Gram's lap? She never lets us sit there. And I have asked. Honey, he's old. He-he thought she was a chair. Right, right. Um, you kids didn't see any of the party last night, did you? Louise: No, but we could hear it. Gene: Those people should learn to have a potluck without popping all those balloons. Tina: And without having really loud s*x. (barking) (whimpers)  I'm not afraid of ghosts  I'm not afraid of sharks  I'm not afraid of cancer  I'm just afraid of snakes  They really creep me out  Where are their arms and legs?  It's not okay!  I'm not afraid of ghosts  I'm not afraid of sharks  I'm not afraid of cancer  I'm just afraid of snakes  They really creep me out  Where are their arms and legs?  It's not okay!  Oh, my Bitsy, baby, Bitsy, I'm gonna miss ya. 
(car engine grinding, not turning over) Bob, we're gonna miss the beginning of the movie. Plus, I'm smuggling chocolate in my pants. We got to get there before it melts. I'm gonna get it. Just a sec. Ugh! Can you roll down the windows back here? I'm starting to breathe in Tina's breath. I can't. They're broken. I think I forgot to brush this morning. Did I? (exhales loudly) Yeah. Yeah, you did. Jimmy: Hey, who am I? (imitates engine not starting) (clicks tongue rhythmically) I'm Bob's car! (laughter) Good one, J.P. Uh, not a good one, Jimmy. (engine starts, Bob laughs) Started right up. They went inside, Dad. Oh. Ugh! Start driving! Gene just took off his shoes! And my socks! Louise: Why don't you wash your children? (engine knocking, stalls) Oh, great. Can't I just take my family to a stupid movie? Dog Prom 3D is not a stupid movie! Are we gonna just leave our car there like that? That's what we're gonna do when Dad and Mom break down. Leave them by the side of the road! Hey, guys, you want to see a live TV show taping? Do I! Give me that. "Come to a taping of Family Fracas." What's Family Fracas? It's a game show where they make families do weird stuff and then dump foam all over them. I'm into weird stuff and foam. Can we go? We should go home and call a tow truck. The car's not going anywhere, Bobby. Come on, it'll be fun. Please, Dad? Please, Dad! Come on! Come on, come on. Come on. Kids: Please! Please! Oh, look! Pam's Court! I love the way she bangs that gavel. Bang! Aah!- Hey, isn't that Pam's ex-husband Chuck? Oh, my God. What's he doing here? Aah! Oh, hey, Chuck. Hello, Belchers. Long time no see since you got my show canceled and me fired. A boobity boobity boobity boo! Linda, nice to see you dressed again. Thank you. Yeah. Sorry about that. It... (laughs) Water under the bridge, Bob. Oh, good. Dark, dirty water. Under a horrible bridge. Um... Oh, but all is well now. You're looking at the new host of Family Fracas! Chuck, we got a problem. The Morgan family just dropped out of the show. Aah. Food poisoning. Gross! We got to find another family of five in the next ten minutes. But how the heck are we gonna do that? The heck right here. Yeah! We're a family of five. No, we're not. One, two, three, four. Oh, yes we are! Harry, this is a bad idea. No idea's a bad idea. I like this guy! I... I don't know. Grand prize is a brand-new minivan. Oh! Wh... whoa! Dad, this is a no-brainer. Dad, come on! No, no. No, no, no. Bobby! If we win the minivan, we can put the car out of its misery. No. What the hell. Let's do it! No! Fantastic! Hooray for Family Fracas! Male Announcer: It's time for Family Fracas! Here's your host... Chuck Charles! (applause and cheering) Hiya, folks! Western Med... Whoa. Is that Bob? Let's welcome back the reigning champs, the O'Donnell family! And competing against the O'Donnells are the Belchers. Hi! Hi, Linda. Look. Tina's on Family Fracas. My cousin was gonna be on that show, but he didn't want to wear that outfit. I don't blame him. Belchers, introduce yourselves. Uh, well, I'm Bob, and this is my wife Linda. Don't look at my hair. I didn't know I was gonna be on TV. And this is my daughter Louise. It's Louise! * And she is gonna win. * Okay, okay, okeydoke. And that one. That's Gene. Camera, take the day off! I added ten pounds to myself! And the last one's Tina. Hi. I'm Tina. I like horses, music and boys. (whispering): Hi, boys. I'm Tina. Okay, that's more than enough. All right, let's get Frackin'! It's time for the Brain Drain! Well, it looks like these guys have lost their marbles. The first team to fill their brain with these wins the challenge. And what does the other team get? All: Foamed! That's right... foamed. On your mark, get set, go! (gasps) Are you trying to distract me by holding my hand? Huh, what? Owen, I feel it, too. But right now, we're competitors. I can't be sweet on you before I beat on you. Tina, marble me! Oh, right. Done! (buzzer sounds, Tina and Gene groan) (applause and cheering) I ate it! I ate it! Num, num, num. I like it! First team to remove all the flies from their soup wins. Losing team gets... face full of foam! All right, Mom, you ready? You pumped? Yeah! Slap my face! What? Slap it! Oh, uh... I'll slap yours. Oh, uh, I'm pumped! I'm pumped! And... go! (groaning) Done! Aha! Yeah! Foam time! (buzzer sounds) The Belchers and the O'Donnells are tied. Whoever wins the Human Claw challenge wins the whole game. (applause and cheering) I can smell that minivan. I call shotgun! I call optional third row. Ugh! The whole third row. Children, shut up, shut up, shut up! And Bob and Pat are gonna get dunked into a pit full of blue balls. The first one to find a yellow ball wins. But they have to grab the ball with their teeth. Families, you control the crane. No crane, no gain, am I right? (bell dings) I am right! (laughter) My harness is a little tight around the groin... Go! Aah! (Bob groans) (applause and cheering) Come on, Dad! Make us proud for once! (bell dinging) I got one! I got one! Dad won! Ha, ha, ha! Ha, ha! Well, bash my head in with a brick. The Belchers won. We won! We won! Yah! Yes! Yay! All right! Yay, Bobby! Wow, Tina won. (speaking gibberish) Honk, honk, honk! O'Donnells, we are really sorry to see you go. You are good people. Bye, Joey and Owen! You're leaving in shame, but you played a good game. (whispering): They were terrible. And now the Belchers are gonna spin the prize wheel for a chance to win a brand-new minivan! (audience sighs and gasps) I got this. (groans) Come on, come on, come on, minivan. Oh, hey, a five-gallon bucket of Fracas foam, so you can get foamed at home. Home foam! No! Yes! It tastes good. Trust me. The Belchers will return tomorrow as the champs and have another sh*t at the minivan. Hey! We're coming back! That's exactly what I just said. Put your hands together for the winning family! (applause and cheering) You hear that? We're the winning family! Yes, they all hear that! I have a microphone. Congratulations to the most annoying winning family in Fracas history. We won most annoying! Yeah! Hi, Ma! You guys, this is so much better than the minivan. Mmm. Gene, stop eating that crap. You're just jealous that I have frothy diarrhea. Come on, you big idiot. (whistling) * La, la, la... Hey, Jimmy, did you happen to catch Family Fracas last night? 'Cause we were on it, and we won. Oh yeah, is that the show where the most pathetic family wins? (laughing) No, no. No, it isn't, Jimmy. Why don't you watch it tonight? I'll send you a shout out. Oh, yeah, why don't you watch this? Hey, I'm Bob! I'm on a game show! Blah, blah, blah! I... I don't want to watch that. I'm gonna change the channel with my remote that I have. Click! I'm still Bob, and I'm still on... Wait, wait, wait. Click. This channel. I just shut you off! I just shut you off... And I'm on that. So you can't say anything! Now I'm on shut off channel. I shut you off! Belchers, meet your competition... the Changs. Hey. Everybody Chang sons tonight. Oh, dear lord. Oh, my gosh, there's Pam! Hi, Pam! I mean, Your Honor. Chuck. I see you're working with these nice folks again. How fun for you! Well, I have to get to court.  You're not a real judge.  If anyone needs me, I'll be in my chambers.  It's not chambers.  It's a dressing room!  I sentence you to kiss my ass! See this right here? That's your punishment! Oh, wouldn't you... ? Oh, you would love it. Oh, you would love it. You can just kiss it. Oh, I will do it. Somebody better kiss somebody's ass, or I'm gonna go crazy. Belchers and Changs are tied. Whoever wins the Human Claw takes the game. Good luck, Changs! And Belchers. But mostly Changs. (applause and cheering) And go! Yeah, Dad, grab those balls! Linda: Yeah! I got one! (bell dinging) Oh! So sorry, Joe. Bob's little rat snout found the ball first, which means the Belchers win! (whooping) All right! Did you just say rat snout? Let me at that wheel! (applause and cheering) Stay! Stay! Stay! Stay! Stay! (audience groans) Foam again?! Uh, Chuck, can I give someone a shout out? Absolutely not. Jimmy Pesto's an idiot! The end. Tough shout out. Hmm. Thanks for sharing, Bob. So glad you guys are coming back. If I could just mention my restaurant, Bob's... No, you may not.  Ooh, ooh-ooh  Pizza game  Ooh  Talking trash  Ooh, spinning the wheel  Fracas foam  Get foamed at home  There's Jimmy Pesto  * He's so mad *  Ooh, ooh-ooh  Fracas foam, get foamed at home  Jealous   No minivan for you.  Harry, please, please, please kick the Belchers off the show. You've asked me that every night this week. And what do I say? You say, "Watch this," and then, you do that thing with your hands. That's right, Chuck. Watch this. Oh, oh. Oh, yeah. Oh, whoa. Oh, oh, rounder. Oh, oh, oh. Whoa! Where we going? Opposites. (laughter) Yup. Here comes a hand. Ah, that's how you get me! You said they could be on one episode, but they keep coming back again and again. Look, it's part of the job. Richard Dawson used to kiss all the women on Family Feud. He didn't pick and choose. He just puckered up. Pucker up, Chuck. No, seriously, pucker up. Hmm. Hmm? Okay, come here. Practice on me. I'm Dawson, you're me. Okay. Mm-hmm. You're Dawson, I'm me. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah, just like that. Okay. Now we're both Dawson. Double Dawson. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mmm, mmm, mmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mmm. Okay, are we good? One more. Maybe someone else should spin the prize wheel tonight since Louise keeps landing on foam. Ooh! I thought you wanted five big buckets of foam! No. I wish you would have told me sooner, Tina! Don't worry. We'll beat the other family like we always do. And tonight, we win the van. I feel it. Jimmy: You're gonna feel your butt being spanked. That's what you're gonna feel. Jimmy?! You're on Family Fracas? Yup. I signed us up. Get ready to lose. I only count four Pestos and your bartender Trev. I told them he was the son I always wanted. What? Right on, Pops. Ha! (laughing): Oh, I see you guys have met. Jimmy, you should just leave right now, because we're unbeatable. Jimmy Pesto! Oh, you're the guy Bob called an idiot on the air. Yeah, yeah, whatever. Hmm. You hate Bob, I hate Bob. I like you. Jimmy Jr., you and I are friends and have been more than friends on one and a half occasions. If you say so. But tonight, we're competitors. I have to put aside my feelings for you. And destroy you. Whoa. You're being kind of intense, Tina. I know. I bring it. And... go! (applause and cheering) Come on Gene and Tina! Brush! Tiny circles! Tiny circles! Come on, Jay Ju! I can't believe you made me care about this. Come on! (breathing heavily) Do it, Jimmy! Go! Hey, Jimmy Jr., you missed a spot. On your face. Quit it, Tina! Gene: T! Pick up the pace! (grunting) Brush, brush, brush, brush! Done! (buzzer sounds)   (both shout) Damn it! (laughs) Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa. (grunts) (grunts) You hit my eye! Here. Now we're twins again! Done! (groans) Yes! (both shout) Oh, what's the point of having twins if they can't hit each other with eggs like they were supposed to? The Belchers and Pestos are neck and neck. It's anybody's game as we head into the Human Claw! Have fun losing, Jimmy. (mocking sounds) Well said, Jimmy. Ready, set, grab that ball! (grunts) (audience cheering) We have a winner! Huh? GENE/TINA/LOUISE: No! What just happened? We lost to the Pestos. (sighs) We had a good run. And that's from a kid who hates running. (laughing) I'm so sorry, Bob. The Pestos are the new champs of Family Fracas! (Pestos cheering) Uh, can you lower me down now? We're trying! It's stuck, Bobby! Chuck, the crane is stuck. Bob, just a second. (laughs) And the Pestos win a brand-new minivan! Oh! Trev: Oh! Oh! Jimmy: Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Pull! Kids, stop. Don't do that. Stop! No, no, no! (all gasp) Gene: Oh, boy. Louise: Oh, Dad. Oh! Ew! (laughter) Chuck: Oh, that's too bad. Let's give the Belchers a big Family Fracas bye-bye! Audience: Bye-bye, Belchers! Bye! What? I'm saying good-bye. I know what you're all thinking... not only did we lose to the Pestos but I also humiliated myself. Correct. I was thinking that. Well, you're right. I blew it. At least we have all this stupid foam. Aw, Bobby. I'm gonna get rid of this Fracas foam. I'm gonna flush it down the toilet. Bye. No! You can't! It's true. It says right there you can't. Oh. Hey, Dad, want a little good news? You're about to go viral. Stop! (audience gasps) Chuck: Oh, that's too bad. (laughs) His pants come off every time. Thanks a lot, guys. Thanks for helping me get past this. No problem. How did Jimmy find that ball in two seconds? It's almost impossible. Bob, stop obsessing. It's over. (groans) This is the fifth time he's circled the block. Jimmy, I get it. You won the minivan. Face it, Bob. You were destined to lose. I knew it, Chuck sure knew it. Wh... what do you mean, "Chuck sure knew it"? What does that mean? What? Nothing. I... I have a disease where I say things, you know, and it makes me drive away... Hmm. (audience cheering) We have a w... We have a w... Dad, if you watch the video in reverse your pants go back on. Thanks, Louise. I'm just watching Jimmy. It's like he knew exactly where to find the yellow ball. And I have a hunch Chuck told him where to look. Watch. (audience cheering) We... Did you see that? Yeah. Wait, what was I supposed to see? He barely fished for it. He cheated. We were wronged. Look, there are a lot of things this family's terrible at. That's true. We were really good at Family Fracas. And if we're gonna lose, I want to lose fair and square. Not because that jerk Pesto cheated. Hey, Dad, can we put a pin in this? We're running late. For what? For the Pesto's minivan. Jimmy Jr.'s having a screening of dirty dancing: Havana Nights. What? No! Didn't you hear what I just said? That's the van of a cheater! What are we supposed to do, Dad? Watch the TV here? That thing makes me sick! You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna drive down to the studio... Gene: The car's broken, Dad! Damn it! I'm gonna walk to the studio and talk to those people face-to-face! You, you, not you and you. Tina, what are you doing here? We're here for the screening. Yeah, let us in. Let's do this. Come on. I don't know, Tina. You said some pretty mean things on Family Fracas yesterday. We'll take that popcorn though. Thank you. Jimmy Jr., wait! What you saw before was my game face. This is my normal face. Let us in! Oh, you're getting a banana in your tailpipe. Oh... And I am not talking about the van. Oh! Bob: I think Jimmy Pesto cheated at the Human Claw game. Hmm. You do? Yes, and I... I think Chuck might've helped him. Hmm... Um, what's happening right now? Here's the thing, Bob. I believe you believe you were wronged. Thank you? This is big. Yes. And I could make it a lot bigger. Yes! Wait, what do you mean? I'm talking about Bob versus Chuck on Pam's Court. Um, no. I don't want to do that. How 'bout I just go to a real court with real lawyers? That costs serious dough. You don't have it. What makes you say that? Those stains, your smells, you walked here, your children, you're not wearing any jewelry. Aw, crap. All right, Pam's Court. Let's do it. All right! Congratulations, Bob. The Belchers are back on TV! You know what that rhymes with? Uh... Long lsland lced Tea. I'm gonna have one. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. You have a bar in your desk? You don't have a bar in your desk? (slurping) I'm gonna leave you alone. Thank you. (slurping) (theme music plays) Pam: Order. Announcer: This is the courtroom of Judge Pam. I'll allow it. And Judge Pam has the final word. Guilty. Not guilty. We'll see you in court. Judge Pam's court. I sentence you to stay tuned. In a very special episode of Pam's Court, burger man Bob Belcher is suing Jimmy Pesto and Pam's ex-husband and new host of Family Fracas, Chuck Charles. This is the case of the Great Balls of lre. All rise. Pam's Court is now in session. You may be seated. So, someone else besides me is accusing Chuck of cheating. Mr. Belcher, you claim that Chuck helped Jimmy Pesto cheat at Family Fracas. Uh, yes, Your Honor. At the Human Claw game, which I happen to be pretty good at. Do you have any evidence to support your claim? Uh, yes, I do, Your Honor. Jimmy said Chuck, quote, "sure knew I was gonna lose." Now, I ask the court, how was Chuck so sure? Mr. Pesto, did you say this? Yeah. I said it. Aha! So he admits it! Yeah, I admit that you lost. And no one was surprised. Your Honor, the prosecution clearly has no case. I hate to agree with the defense, and also, I hate the defense and his smug face, and his misshapen pen1s. Ho-ho-ho-ho! Well, it pleased the court. The court was faking it. (laughs) I don't think so. You shut up. No, you shut up. Shut your mouth. Shut your mouth. I will jump over there, and shut it for you. Edit that out. Do you have any other evidence, Mr. Belcher? You bet he does! You got something, right? Come on, give it to 'em. Actually, I... I don't. I... I... thought, uh... that when I said that one thing he would just confess. Bobby, that's all you got? Quick! Let's call a surprise witness! Who? I call Henry Kissinger to the stand! Order! I think I have my ruling. Announcer: Will Bob's beef be settled? Lettuce find out after the break. (buzzer sounds) Bob, we're gonna lose this case. Jimmy cheated, Lin. I know it. Hey, we're on TV. We know, Tina. We're on Pam's Court. Pretty neat, huh? It's a TV show. No, we're on that TV. Hi. Wait a sec. That's it! What? And we're back in three, two... I went to my chambers and reviewed this case. Objection! You did not! You were here. You were putting on makeup the whole time. You don't even need makeup, on. Oh, thank you. Linda: You're beautiful. And that robe... Pam: You're wonderful. I'd love to see you without makeup though to be honest. Moving on! In the case of Great Balls of lre, I rule that... Bob: Wait, Your Honor! I... I have new evidence. I can prove my case. Go on. These cameras, they're always rolling. Right? Correct. A... and the same with the cameras on Family Fracas, right? Uh-oh. One of those cameras may have caught Chuck helping Jimmy cheat. The Foam Cam! Dad, the Foam Cam is on the ceiling! I never forget a camera that feeds me. Objection! Objection! Hearsay! Inadmissible... hears-say... Overruled! Bring me the Foam Cam tape. Does this mean we're gonna win? I sure hope so, Tina. Good. Psst. Your ass is grass. And I'm gonna mow it. Leave me alone! Hey, so we... can't show that tape. Oh, you did help Jimmy cheat. Shh! Yes. Yes! And I had to get rid of the Belchers. You gave me no choice. I put the ball in Jimmy's mouth. You put it in your mouth and then you kissed it into his mouth. What? No. I put it into his mouth with my hand. Huh. That's one way to do it. I'll take that. Ha! There's the evidence, idiot. Ha, you're the idiot. What do we do? I'm not gonna let the host of one of my shows lose a trial on another one of my shows. Hey! What are you doing? Whoops. Ah, Judge Pam, did you see that? Huh? See what? I saw it! The evidence must be on that tape. Which means Dad was right. Yes! What is going on with my lighter right now? It's burning this tape. What the hell? He's burning the tape! Pam? You know what to do. Right. Without any actual evidence, I have to rule in favor of the defense. Yes! Oh, yeah! Justice! (buzzer sounds) What's going on? Why are we getting foamed? This is a court show. The losers get foamed on Pam's Court. That's insane. They have foam on all their shows on this channel. Oh, no friggin' way! I want my minivan! All right, you're gonna have to sit down. (screams) Down you go. I will kick you in the jaw. I will... Just put my hand on your throat, and down you go. What're we gonna do now? Nothing. We lost. But Jimmy and Chuck cheated. Doesn't matter. We were never gonna win this case. This whole thing was fixed. Let's just go home and... and never watch any shows on Channel 13 again! Oh come on, you don't mean that. Yes I do! I might watch a little bit of Pam's Court. Just a little bit. When are we getting the car back, Dad? I don't know. The mechanic called yesterday but I never called him back. I thought we were gonna win the minivan. That van is dead to me! Look, there it is. Louise: Oh, I love it so much. Oh, problem with the van, Jimmy? What? It's nothing. Damn it! You don't know how to change a tire. Ha! You don't know how to change a tire. Hey. Who am I? "I can't change a tire and my whole family is watching me not be able to do something simple." You are mean. Yeah, Bob. Geez, Dad. What? He's the one who said it to us when our car wouldn't start. Yeah, but he was funny. He was funnier? Mm-hmm. Yeah. No. Yeah. No. Mm-hmm. No, he wasn't. He kind of was. Are you... zll right, let me help. Move over. "Let me help. Move over." He just did it again! "He just did it again." He's doing it right now! "He's doing it right now." Linda: Oh, yeah, it's funny. (Pam's Court theme music plays) Pam: Order. I'll allow it. Guilty. Not guilty.  I think I have my ruling. Moving on. Right.
Gene, you almost done scraping the gum off the bottom of the counter? Yeah! And I'm almost done with Gumhead. Here you go, Gumhead. Num, num, num, num, num, num! More gum! Gene, knock it off. I know you think you're helping, but you're not. I don't think I'm helping. All right, step right up. Which cup is the creamer under, Tina? Keep your eye on the creamer, little lady. Where's it going? Where's it going? Louise. Yeah, Dad? Do you know where the cream is? No. All right, then stay out of it. Is it here? Is it this one? Is it that one? Uh... Huh, huh, huh, huh. This one? Wrong! Now you have to drink it. Ugh. Okay. Tina, Louise, enough, and get back to work. This is a big weekend for us. It's Fleet Week! Yay! Feet Week! No. Fleet Week. Why would there be a Feet Week? I don't know. There's Arbor Day. Who needs that? Any minute now, sailors will be pouring through that door, wanting burgers and beer. Mostly beer, but still. Excuse me, sir, but I need to inspect your table for gum. Gene, get out of there. No! Gumhead needs lips! Give me the Gumhead. Mm, no! Give me your Gumhead! I'm sorry, sir. Gene! Give me back my son! I just need to breathe life into him! All right, Tina, new game, new game. Keep your eye on the cream. Try not to blink. Gene, don't hit your mother. Linda, don't kick him! You missed it! Wrong! Drink it! Drink it! Louise? Uh, check, please? Gene? Aah! Damn it! I cut my hand! Oh, somebody pee on it! I just went pee! This is a disaster! Oh. Never mind. It's okay. I'm not bleeding. False alarm. Phew! You had me worried there. You get so woozy when you bleed. Remember that time he flossed? He passed out right into the toilet. Oh, whoa, whoa. Wait. That's why I never floss. Blood is your teeth's way of saying, "Mind your own business!" I only floss on my birthday... Guys. ...so I can look back on the year and remember what I ate. Plus, he can't clot to save his life. He bleeds forever. It's gross. I'm act... I'm actually bleeding here. (distorted): Bobby? You... okay? I'm fine. It's just a little bluh... (Bob sighs) What am I doing down here? You passed out, Dad. No, I didn't. Pretty sure you did. Maybe you took a little catnap. I didn't pass out, Tina. Aw, my little Wobbly Bobbly. Hmm. Oh, crap. All right. We got to finish prepping for the lunch rush. Uh-uh. No, I'll be fine, Lin. I don't know. You got cut right in the old finger crotch. Oh, no! Not the family finger crotch jewels! Guys, I said it's fine. It's not even... (mumbling): No. Oh, God. Okay, okay, let's go. (groans) You're not gonna stop bleeding. Okay, I-I might need a couple stitches. Linda, you have to stay for the lunch rush. I'll drive myself. It's not gonna be a prob... (mumbles) Oh! Oh, you're not driving. Come on, give me the keys. We'll just have to close for lunch. We'll be back in a few hours. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! We could run the restaurant. No, no. Yeah, we can do it. We'll just tell people that Dad's in the shower and Mom's on the toilet. Why do I have to be on the toilet? Fine, you can both be on the toilet. And Dad went out for a pack of smokes and never came back. No, no, no. We're closing the restaurant and we're going to the hospital, all right? Kids, upstairs. Tina, you're babysitting. Countdown to babysitting. Excitement begins now. 100, 99, 98... Four, three, two, one. Who's ready for some fun? I can't hear you. I'd be open to fun. Let's see here. We can play Torpedo, Surgery Sam, or if we need to blow off some steam, we can make a get-well card for Dad. "Happy stitches, Dad. You deserve it." Or how about, "Stitch, please!" Ugh, I don't want to make cards. I want to make money! I say we go down there, and we open up for business. Yeah. But Mom and Dad will be home in an hour. Maybe we could play pretend restaurant? I'm restocking the napkin dispenser. Gene, you go clean the floors. If we're pretending, I'm... I'll make fresh mozzarella. We're not making money in this fake restaurant, Tina! Not yet, but we're building good pretend word of mouth. Oh! This is gonna be the longest hour of my life. Wait till childbirth, girlfriend. In and out, two stitches, five minutes. Here we go. We're doing it. (coughing) Whoa. Ooh. Okay, Mom. The bad news is, Mom and Dad are gonna take longer than they expected. The good news is, now we have more time for activities. (singsongy): Like more pretending. Should we pretend we have a dog and give it medicine? I've got an activity for you. It's called... (sings fanfare) ...opening the restaurant. Ah. Whoa. The kids are running Bob's Burgers, and this time it's personal! I'm gonna personally run it into the ground! Wait. Why is that personal? Tina, shush. Okay. We finally get to run the restaurant. And we're gonna do it right. Let's see. We can blow that wall out, put the drive-thru there. No! We need 200 chickens. From now on, we only serve poultry! No, we only serve kale. And we should replace our chairs with treadmills. We'll be the healthiest restaurant in town. People will leave hungry. No, no. We want fat people who can't leave our restaurant. No, treadmills. Chicken! Treadmills. Chicken on a treadmill, last offer. Okay. (door bells tinkle) Welcome to McChickies. What can I put in your beak? Uh... I'll have a cheeseburger and fries? Great, and for only two dollars more, you can have your burger chickenized. Ba-kok! No, I don't think I want that. I could offer you a kale-sserole. Or a kale-sadilla. You know what? I forgot to feed the meter. Didn't you just get off a boat? It's the... boat meter. Got to go! Wait. I made a chicken hat. Did you not notice it? Okay, guys, bring it in. Ugh! Why did we ever think a restaurant was a good idea? We've watched Mom and Dad fail at it for years. They make failing look so easy. How do they do it?! But what if there was a restaurant that didn't serve any food and just served up gambling? I thought gambling was illegal. (chuckling): Not if no one sees you do it. No, I think it still is. But not if no one knows about it. I still think maybe we should... We're doing it, Tina! (loud hacking cough) Okay. Sorry. Hey, do you think this is broken? Please, no. Look what I can do with it. I'm feeling light-headed. All right, moving seats! Go, go! (sobbing) (gags) (sneezes) There's nowhere to go. Oh, back to Cough Guy. No, not back there! Oh. (coughing) Welcome back. (retching) (gagging) I can't take it anymore! I got to get out of here! Bob Belcher? That's us! Party of two, coming through! Look at it, guys... our very own underground casino. The Meatgrinder! Did you name it after our meat grinder? Louise: Andy and Ollie will discreetly spread the word around town. Secret casino! Secret casino! Shh! Keep it quiet, though, because it's a secret! Shh! Louise: We'll get Zeke to run the door. Play to win? Come on in. You're a nerd? Join the herd. Louise: And I've hired the fourth grade mathletics geeks to be our dealers. Tina, you're in charge of hospitality. Sodas, snacks, pats on the backs. Okay. Gene, you're in charge of the entertainment. (gasps) I've got a great group. They'll be perfect... the Cutie Patooties. The what? It's a girl group I've been putting together. Hey, I found these wigs in the trash. I say we start a girl group! We'll call 'em the Cutie Patooties! Who's in? Oh, we got one! Oh, no, no, no. I'm not interested. I'm just going to the bathroom. Gross. I'll do it. Great! But you're gonna need a stage name. What's your real name? Dottie Minerva. Well, now you're, hmm... Misty Gish. I'll join, too. Great. Let's call you... Dottie Minerva. I want to do it, too. We're out of names. So you'll have to be... Girl Number Three. Huh? Yeah. And I'll be the eye in the sky, watching over everything. Especially the money. But I'm still babysitting. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't you worry that pretty little empty head. Just serve those drinks, huh? Ow. Hey, how's it going? I'm Dr. Eigerman. Look at that face! So young! I want to breastfeed that face! Thanks. Ah, ah, I think I just need a few stitches. Stitches. Great. Those are no problem for a doctor. Hey! Finger crotch. Why do people keep calling it that? Ah, because your fingers are like the legs and then in the middle, it... Don't do that. Stop. All right, let's stitch you right up, here. Ow! Oh, boy. Look at me, look at me. I'm gonna faint. Look at me. You'll be fine. Ah... He's a doctor. Remember that time, we were on vacation, and you were in the water, you're swimming around, right? Focus, focus! And you're having fun. Oh, you're having fun, right? (chuckles) I don't remember that. See? Wait, are you watching a video? Mm... yes. About what? (mumbling): How to give stitches... Of how to give stitches? Yeah. My... (phone chimes) Oh, text here. Coming in. (chuckles) Who is it? My mom. Aw. Mommy must be proud of her little doctor. Yeah. We're celebrating tonight. It's my first day without the attending physician supervising me. Wait. First day? First patient! (whoops) Oh, you want me to take a picture for your mommy? Uh... Bobby, you take a picture of us. Well, Lin, my... I kind of... Bob, take it. Take it. All right, fine. Stitches. Stitches. What's the password? Here's a hint: Rhymes with "squid narcs." Skid marks. Okay. Get on in there. (indistinct conversation, laughter) One water, one fizzazz... Hot towel? Hot towel, anyone? All right, Patooties, get your Cutie faces on. Misty, you're singing lead. And it's time for this star to shine. Just like we rehearsed. We didn't rehearse. Oh, my God, we didn't rehearse. All right, even better. It'll be fresher. Go out there. Go, go, go, go, go. Go. (whispering): What do I do? (whispering): Girls being girls being girls being girls... girl group! (whispering): Girls being girls being girls being girls... (whispering): No, no, no, no. I whisper, you don't whisper. Oh. You-you sing it. (off-key):  Girls being girls being girls being girls...  Come back, come back, come back. Not your night, not your night. Girl group! Uh, we're gonna take a quick fiver. Technical difficulties. In the meantime, Sammy Hagar, everybody. Come on, come on, keep those bets coming, people. Winner, winner, burger dinner! Louise, why are we in our underwear? So you don't steal any of that money you're counting. I stole a tomato. I'm sorry. Oh, it's all right. You didn't mean it. You were just hungry, huh, friend? Yeah. Saw a tomato and you were like, "Hey, I know where this goes... in my underwear." Yeah... Just count the money! F-9. You torpedoed my frigate. We've got a winner. (laughs) All right. Congratulations. Well, I noticed that's your fourth win in a row. You're lucky... a little too lucky. Uh, thanks. I was just about to cash out. Ah, not so fast, forehead sweat. I also noticed your friend over there giving you hand signals. Well, I'd like to introduce you to my friend. Zeke. You know what a purple nurple is? Yes. You can keep the money, friend. Or you can keep your nurple. But you can't keep both. Not my nurples! Now get out of here! Scram! (whimpers) Nothing to see here, folks! Tina! Drinks over here. On the house, whatever they want. What do you want? Why are you crying? I lost my allowance. No tears at the Meatgrinder... just fun! Fischoeder: Well, well, well. I came in to use the bathroom, and what do I find? An underground casino. That's actually underground. Who owns this building? Oh, yes, that's right. I do. (Fischoeder laughs) Who's in charge here? Uh... Uh... We are a group of entrepreneurs, but it was my idea. You are in very big trouble, young lady. Because I am a gambling man. One hundred dollars on Surgery Sam. Let's play. (cheering, whoops) Yes! The Meatgrinder is about to grind up a whale. Hold up, I got to metal-detect you. Beepity-beep, beep, beep, beep-beep-beep. All right, you're good. Go on in. Look. I love Misty Gish, but she's not ready to sing lead. Dottie Minerva is a star, and it's time for that star to shine. (off-key):  Girls being girls being girls being girls...  Oh, my God, oh, my God... you're even worse than Misty Gish. Gene, I could give it a try. Girl Number Three, you're a backup singer. You don't even have a name. But I guess you'll have to do for now... you're up. Cue the music. (clears throat)  Girls being girls being  Girls being girls...    Wow, she's amazing. I'm gonna make that girl a star. And my wife. Girl Number Three Belcher. (game buzzes) Fischoeder: Oh, damn it. Sam, why would you eat a car? Well, another hundred dollars to the house. Oh, nice try, Mr. Fischoeder. You'll get 'em next time. You think? Yeah, oh, yeah. (chuckling): Eh, okay. Your luck's got to change sometime, buddy. Ooh... Rock, Paper, Scissors. Or as it was known in ancient China... Huo-zhi tou. Oh, yeah, you like Rock, Paper, Scissors? You want to play that? Hundred dollar bet. Uh... Go ahead. American rules. Throw on the four count... ready? Mm. One, two... One, mm... three... sh**t! three... I win... fantastic! Ah, it's no big deal. The house can lose a few, right? We're still way up. Let's keep this going. One, two, three... Two, three... sh**t. sh**t. (laughs) Okay, okay, I'm jumping in here. New dealer, new hand... get out of here. What'd I do? Well, that should do it. Oh, my God. I think I passed out. What happened? Oh, I just, uh, fixed up the old finger crotch cut. Why is my whole arm bandaged? I thought I'd just k*ll the roll, you know? Did you shave my arm? Uh, yeah. Why did he shave my arm? He shaved your arm. Why did he shave my arm, Lin? Because he's a doctor. What happened when I passed out? Bob, nothing. It's all on video. Wait, what's on video? We filmed it... it's his first patient. All right, I'm getting out of here. His mom wanted to see it. She-she really appreciates it. My other arm is shaved! Mm-hmm. Why'd you shave my body?! He's looking for other cuts. Lin, we're going. All right... bye. One, two, three... You're about to throw... sh**t! Aah! rock! (laughs) How did you know that? Get out of my head! Come on, give me some more. What do you got? Give it to me. (groans) We're out of money? I take IOUs. Great! Play again? Yes. All right, we're on in five. You know the drill. Girl Number Three, you're our new number one! Um, we were talking, Gene, and we've decided that the Cutie Patooties are breaking up. Breaking up? But this was just the beginning. I was gonna get you an MP3 deal and your own perfume. Patoot... smells like girl farts. Yeah, well, I'm leaving the business to focus on my glitter stickers. And I want to spend more time at home with my pets. And I'm learning how to French braid. When I met you, you were eating lunch at school. So? So, see you tomorrow at lunch at school. I don't need them. I can be a girl group all by myself. I certainly have the passion. Two, three, sh**t. Two, three, sh**t! (laughs) Aah! Another win. I should gamble against children more often. Louise, I think we're losing a lot of money. Oh, really? I know we're losing a lot of money! I feel it! (sighs) Hopefully we can still make it home for the dinner rush. Seems like blood shouldn't be able to get through all this. Stop messing with it, Bobby. This isn't... I know he didn't do it right. Leave it alone. I'm just gonna take a quick peek. Bobby, I said... aah! Ooh! Oh, my God! Aah, aah! (yelling) Oh, my God! Oh, God, look at it! It went in my mouth! Oh, I swallowed your blood. (screaming) I've swallowed your blood. Oh, I'm gonna faint. I'm gonna throw up. (woozy mumbling) I'm gonna throw up. What? (retching) Oh, we need to go back to the hospital. (tires screeching) (humming) No. Hey, it's you guys. Are there any other doctors here? I can't tell you that. It's doctor-doctor confidentiality. There's no such thing. I can't talk about it... but there is. No, there's not. I'll-I'll take a nurse. You want that for here or to go? (chuckles) I don't get it. Sorry, that... that usually kills. Okay, I'll go get the nurse. Just don't tell her I said that.  Girls being girls being girls being girls  Girl group, shut your mouth.  Thank you, Meatgrinder. Tip your waitress... I'm friends with her dad. Hmm. One, two, three... One, two, three... sh**t! sh**t! Yes! No! Kids, we're home! Look at your father's arms. They shaved me. He looks like a turkey. Lin, wash your face, please. I'm gonna faint again. Oh, come on. Look at me... blah! (laughs) Oh, my God. Kids! Come look at my bloody face. Tina? Gene? Louise? Anybody here? Underground casino? Coat off. Game on. Well... I think it's time to cash out. Where should I, uh, to whom do I, uh...? Just one more game. No... Come on! If there's one thing I learned from that week I was married, it's when to walk away. What the hell is going on here? Yeah, what is going on here? Uh-oh. Louise, these two snuck in somehow. Like some kind of ninjas. Hi, Mom and Dad, whoa, you're back. Bob. Mr. Fischoeder? Perfect timing. I was just about to, uh, collect my winnings. Your winnings? Yes, the house owes me some money. And I believe you are the house. Oh, my God. Uh, how much does "the house" owe you? $5,000. What?! Congratulations, sir. Sorry, Dad, it's my job. (groans) Oh, hey, Marshmallow. What is this? Wha-What's going on here? Well, it's an underground casino. You kids are supposed to be upstairs. Well, there's no room for a casino upstairs. What are you doing with Mommy's crackers? Got to keep the players happy. Flirt a little, wink a little. (Fischoeder clears throat) Sorry to interrupt, Belcher family, but, um, there seems to be a certain unresolved matter of my $5,000. Mr. Fischoeder, you can't expect me to pay you. I mean, they're just kids playing pretend casino. Why can't you play like normal kids? Why can't you bleed like a normal dad? A bet is a bet, Bob. I once lost $30,000 on a horse. She just ran off with it. Listen, I-I can't afford this, Mr. Fischoeder. Well, I'll just raise your rent by a thousand dollars a month for five months. Dad, a word... in private? No. Family meeting, huh? Mom, family meeting? No. Ooh, family meeting. Excuse us a second, Mr. Fischoeder. Certainly. We could play him double or nothing. What? No. We're already in the hole. I'm not gonna owe him $10,000. Dad, I can't beat him, but you can. With that. This... why would I play him with this? My hand's stitched. Plus, I'm not even left-handed. Exactly... if you use that hand, he'll think you can't throw scissors. And that's why you're gonna throw scissors. But I really can't. My fingers won't separate. Yeah, keep saying that. We need him to think you think that. No, Louise, I can't actually do it. Great, so you know what you have to do. Oh, my God. That's my girl. That's my little mind-gamer. My little "Amarosa." But what if Mr. Fischoeder knows that we think that he thinks that Dad can't throw scissors? Or what if he thinks that we know that he thinks that? Or what if he thinks...? Any outcome is possible, Tina, life is chaos! Bob: Gene, why are you wearing that? I'm just a girl with a dream who got tired of hearing the word no! Uh, hello, Belchers... time is money, and I believe it's pay me o'clock. I'm gonna play him. Bobby, are you sure? That's a lot of money. We don't have any other choice, Lin. He's gonna raise the rent... I have to. (groans) Bobby, your finger crotch looks like a '70s porno. Mr. Fischoeder, we have a proposition. Wonderful. You and me... Hmm. Rock, Paper, Scissors, Double or nothing. Oh, I like this. One match for all the beans. If I lose, you owe me nothing. If I win, you pay me $10,000. Double or nothing, that's also my approach to underpants. Shall we dance? All (chanting): Rock, Paper, Scissors. Rock, Paper, Scissors. Rock, Paper, Scissors. One... Rock, Paper, Scissors. two... Rock, Paper, Scissors. three... Rock, Paper, Scissors. sh**t! (Bob yelling) No! (all cheering) Oh, you did it, Bobby! I misread you, Bob. Didn't think could throw scissors with that hand. I thought you were a little bit of a... a wussy. Told you, Dad. I got you out of this. No, you got me into this. And out of it. In, in, in, in, Out, out, out, out, in, in, in. out, out, out. Stop. Out. Well, I guess we're even. Or we run it back... double the double. 20 grand, one throw... let's do this. I'm game. You've got a hot hand, Dad, use it. Yeah, keep the luck going, Meryl Streak. No, no, this is over. No more gambling. So we're not in trouble anymore? Of course you're in trouble. Could you point that in another direction? Sorry. Eh, it's all right. That's... crazy stream of blood. That's a lot of blood... (groans) Pass out if we're not in trouble. You're not in trouble... mmm. Yay! All right, kids, help me get him in the car. We're going back to the hospital. Yay! (music playing) Hit it. Oh, he did.  When Bob sees blood  And screams and passes out  Then Mr. Fisch checks in and cashes out  What more do you want  When kids run the restaurant?  Hey, sailor. Ooh, nice pants.  Marshmallow played a game of Surgery Sam  And all this  'cause Bob cut his hand  What more do you want  When kids run the restaurant? 
 I'm mining the cave for love  Don't care about the world above  Down here it's dark and cold  I'm just looking for a nugget of gold  My hat is hard but my heart is soft  It's dusty down here and so I cough  (coughing)  It's a dirty job but I ain't stoppin'  I know I'm breathin' toxins but you're lookin' foxin'  Will you be mine?  Coal mine  Will you be mine?  Diamond...  Tina: Hey, I was watching that. Bad enough I'm being forced to go to their concert. It's like I'm going to the electric chair and you're making me watch videos of the electric chair. Louise, you be nice. Your Aunt Gayle got you those tickets and she's excited to take you. I'm super excited. I've been practicing my concert scream all week. (weakly): Ah... Ah... Still ne... might need some work. Why would you waste a scream on a stupid boy band? Screams are for roller coasters or axe murderers or Dad's morning breath. Hey, it's not that bad. (screams) Oh, whew! Brush your teeth. I did. Well, then, help me look for my keys. I've told you to stop putting stuff in there if you ever want to see it again. You put my baby brother in there and that was the last we saw of him! Javier Belcher, I love you! I'm serious. We're gonna be late for Gene's table-setting competition. Ugh. Do I really have to? I-I'd rather go to the boy band concert. Bob, one of our kids is actually participating in something. We're going, even if it's table-setting. It's table-scaping. And it's the most exciting competition on four legs. It combines accurate table-setting placement with creative themes and costumes. I'm sure it's much more exciting than it sounds. It has to be. Right? Gene, how did you even end up going to the regionals in table-setting, anyway? It was the only non-athletic after-school activity, and I creamed the competition. As you can see, my tablecloth is a trash bag. Mm-hmm. Please enjoy this gar-beverage. Amusing. And when the meal is over, you can deposit your dirty silverware in the truck to head to the dump. Beep! Beep! (imitates whirring hydraulics) Our theme is twin dinner. Twinner! Two knives. Two forks. Two napkins. Two plates... Congratulations, Gene. You're going to regionals. All right! Mmm. Gene, if you like setting tables so much, why don't you set tables at the restaurant? Or here? (chuckles) No, Dad. I don't set where I eat. Where's Aunt Gayle? It's my first concert. I want to hurry up and start remembering this moment for the rest of my life. Maybe Aunt Gayle realized that she's a 42-yeldaroman and she shouldn't be into boy bands? (phone rings) Hello? (exhales) Hi, Aunt Gayle. Are you outside? An emergency? Emergency? Okay, yeah... I-I understand. Bye. Give me the bad news. Give me the bad news! Aunt Gayle pepper-sprayed one of her cats because she thought he was an intruder trying to sexually as*ault her. She has to take him to the vet and we have to miss the concert. Yeah! This is the best thing Aunt Gayle's done since she pooped her pants at the cell phone store last year. Ugh, my heart just pooped its pants. (makes farting sound) Wow. Lots of people. I didn't realize that table-setting was such a big deal. 'Scaping! Check out those trophies. Linda: Ooh, and judges with buttons that say "judge." Well, got to get cracking if I'm gonna win first place. You know, honey, it's okay if you don't win. Yeah, Gene, I mean, win or lose, we're just proud that... you're setting a table at the competitive level. Ooh, mini croissants! No matter what I say, stop me when I've had 16. (hums) So, now that we're not going to the concert, what should we do first? (groans) All right, I'll give it a sh*t. (groaning) (Tina groaning) (groans) Is this it? Yeah, that's good. (both groaning) Okay! I hate this. Come on, Tina, cheer up. It's four lame boys who dance. There's so much more out there in the world. No, there isn't! Ugh, it's no fun having you down if I'm not the one who got you there. (sadly): I'm sorry. Fine. I'm not a monster. I'll help you. What do you mean? I mean I'll get you to the concert. I'll get you there. How? Are you sure we can bike all the way there by the time the concert starts? Not if we keep chitchatting like this. Oh, here's the freeway. Once we merge, get in the fast lane, okay? And we'll get there in no time. (moans) What? (moans) (tires squeal) (coughs) Tina: Zeke? What are you doing here? Me and my cousin Leslie are going to sell some bootleg T-shirts and hot dogs at the Boyz 4 Now concert. Boom. Whatcha letcha. Ha! Check it out. One size fits all. Damn, this one says my card's declined, too. Zeke, you have any money? Nah, my white ass is broke. Hey, I've got gas money. You got room for two more in that buggy? You slip me a fiver, I'll be your driver. Leslie loves rhymes. And pasta that comes in cans. If it ain't from a can, it don't go in this man. (laughs) I've never ridden with this many hot dogs before. A day of firsts. Watch out. You squish 'em, you bought 'em. Tina: Boyz 4 Now, here we come. Zeke: Don't squish it! Tina: So who's your favorite Boy 4 Now? Griffin's the hot one. And he's super extreme. His dog is a wolf. Stop. And then there's Allen. He's cute but shy. His fans are called Allen-coholics. Ugh. My stepmom's an Allen-coholic. And a shopaholic. Double trouble! This is Matt. He's moody and a little older. I think, like, 17. Louise: Maybe his mustache is 17, but he's 90. And then there's Boo Boo. He's young but crazy good at dancing. I used to be a real Boo Boo Booster, but now I'm kind of into Griffin. Ugh, stop talking! (mumbling) Stop. Stop. Okay, I'm gonna put my fist in your mouth. (muffled): Okay. Oh, Marilyn. Tragic beauty. (gasps) I love your son's table. Hi. Aw. Thank you. Magic. Hmm. Uh, what's "hmm"? Your table's cute. But only one person can take home the Golden Plate. And we sure didn't come to take home the Silver Spoon. Yeah, well, we ne... neither did we. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah! Oh, please. Come on, Oscar. You've still got a crying Joe DiMaggio to carve out of butter. Bye, guys. Good luck. Don't talk to them! Gene, get back to work on your table. You've got to win. I thought you said it was okay if I didn't win. Well, that was before we met that idiot. Now, chop-chop. Ooh, Dad, you got the fever! 'Scaping fever! Whoo! Can't escape the 'scape! Let's do this! Yeah! (screaming, squealing) Ugh, no wonder no one likes women. All right, see you after the show. Be careful. There's a lot of puberty in there. I can't believe I'm here. It's really happening. I feel light-headed. Whoa! No fainting! I don't think I'm strong enough to go in there alone. I need you to come with me. (sighs) Fine. I'll get you to your seat so you don't get trampled, but then I am out of there. (screaming, squealing) What is wrong with all of you? They're just boys! Boys? Where? (retches) Oh, come on. Woman: Hello, young man. What can you tell me about your table? Oh, well... Wait, what's that behind your ear? Is this your place card? Oh! Oh, my! Now, please, take your seat. Allow me to put your napkin on your lap. Ah...? Very clever. Oh, I seem to have forgotten my centerpiece. Or did I? Eh? And what menu would you serve with this setting? For the entrée, you'll pull a roasted rabbit out of your top hat plate. Served with abracadab-braised potatoes and ice cream shazamwiches for dessert! Oh! She's smiling. I think it's going well. He looks good. He looks loose. I'm pleased to announce our four finalists: Melissa Brown, Oscar Anthony... I did it! I did it! ...Heather Smith and Gene Belcher. Yay! Yay! Wait, why are there four winners? Finalists, please report to your table and begin assembling your second original display. Second display? If you thought our first table was good, which you did... No, we didn't. ...just wait until you see our second one. I don't want to give anything away, but we're about to take a rocket ship out of this world. So it's space-themed? I can't say. Well, it is. You just basically said it. I'll never tell. Plus, I didn't think your first table was good. I graciously disrespect your answer. Well, wait till you see what we got, okay? I'm busy then. Well, you're gonna have to look at it if you're here. (chuckles) I'm double-parked. Okay, finalists. On your mark, get set, set. All right, Gene, what have you got? It better be bigger and more impressive than outer space. Or Marilyn in space. Marilyn in space. I didn't know there was supposed to be a second display. What?! Uh... Did you read the rules, Gene? No! There were 16 pages. I only got up to the part that said no open-toed shoes. What are we gonna do? We can't lose. We've come too far. Come too far? Come too far?! We haven't come too far, Lin! We're just getting started! Okay, so what are we gonna do?! Why am I talking like this?! I don't know! Why am I tal... I think I'm excited! Oh, God! This is weird! We got to win it! Let's win it! (gasps) What? I'm wearing open-toed shoes. Ah, sh**t. Crowd (chanting): Boyz 4 Now! Boyz 4 Now! Boyz 4 Now! Okay, Teen, I think you're all set. Um, I'm gonna get out of here. So, I'll see you later, okay, buddy? Announcer: Good evening, ladies and girls! Are you ready? (cheering and screaming) You know them, you love them! What are they? Crowd: Boyz... 4... Now! (chanting): Boyz 4 Now! Boyz 4 Now! I hope those are the kinds of lasers that slice people in half. Announcer: Please welcome... Allen! (cheering, screaming) (Louise laughing) Holy crap. Announcer: Griffin! Lot of wires. Not quite creating the illusion. You guys seeing this? Right there! Announcer: Matt! Uh-oh. Sky Grandpa! Announcer: And Boo Boo! This is terrible. Who let all these pretty girls in here? (gasps)  I want to hear your secrets  I'm so interested in you  (upbeat pop music playing) (screams) Boo Boo! Oh, my God, who the frig am I?!  Will you be mine? Coal mine  (grunting) You're gonna miss Allen's poetry solo. (gasps, panting) You do not like a boy. You do not like a boy! Especially a boy named... Boo Boo. Aw. Aah! Stop it! Oh, God! Get a hold of yourself! (grunts, moans) Aah! No! (spitting) (panting) Ah, Boo Boo's so cute. Cute? He's the reason faces were invented, you idiot!  I need to show you a secret  It's gonna be a surprise  Come a little bit closer  Let me whisper in your eyes  (singing along):  When I whisper in your eyes  Don't think, don't blink  Hey, girl, shh. Shush. Close your lips and open your eyes. I want your eyes to hear my lips and also my eyes... Oh, my God! Tina. Tina! I thought you were leaving. Change of plans. I need to talk to you. I have questions. Tell me about the band again. But in the car, you didn't want to... Tell me! Well, Allen... Next! Um, Griffin's... Yeah, sure, Griffin, Griffin. Uh-huh-huh. Next! Okay, Matt... Next! Well, that leaves Boo Boo. Oh, really? That's interesting. Tell me more. What about Boo Boo? Boo Boo's the youngest. And he's got a really great voice, but he hasn't hit puberty yet, so that could change. What's he into? Sports? I could get into sports. What the hell else does he like? I want to give him things. Whoa, Louise. You like Boo Boo? What?! No, Tina, that's... Okay, right, like, I like a boy. That's... Ugh! Do you think he might like me? Oh, my God, what's happened to me?! Cut me open! I'm infected! Pull it out! It's okay, Louise. You're just having a crush. Never! Boo Boo! Oh, my God, you are sick, Louise Belcher. You are sick! I'm going to get you through this. Tell me what you like about Boo Boo. Nothing. Everything. I don't know. Do you like his hair? You mean those soft blond bangs you want to hide under like an umbrella on a rainy day? No, not really. And his face? Ew, gross, it's so gorgeous! I just want to slap it. I want to slap it. I just want to slap his hideous, beautiful face. Um, you mean kiss? No, I mean slap. Whoa. You got it bad, girl. Linda: Okay, I read the rules. It says here you can use anything you brought with you. So brainstorm. Go. Hmm... hmm-hmm-hmm. Oh, I got it! We could shave Dad, glue his hair to the table, and the theme could be "That's Nasty." Let's steal another kid's display. What?! Bob, no. Okay, not that. We don't have to cheat. But we have to win, by probably not cheating. Oh, ew, Bob, your breath. Take a mint. You can smell it all the way over there? I don't know what's wrong with me. Maybe I'm dying. That's it! Mom's purse. Dump it out! Yeah, Lin, there's got to be all sorts of stuff in there. Let's take a look. All right, dump it. Gene: That's where all my wadded tissues went. Start making piles of stuff that could go together. Eh... okay, I got one. Lipstick, pepper spray, tiny bag of carrots. What's the theme? Uh, "Woman of the Night." She gets dressed up, she kills a john, she has a snack. Uh, let's keep making piles.  Tell me  About every single time you've cried    (singing along):  The first time  Oh, when your goldfish died.  This is amazing. Eight encores. They usually only do seven. Shut up! Why would you talk during a song? Please be quiet, Tina. (song ends) (cheering) What? They can't be done. I'm not done! Where are they going? Tina: Backstage. They probably have backstage passes. Uh, let's go do that. But we don't have passes. Tina, did you learn nothing from the Boyz 4 Now song, "Girl, You Don't Need a Backstage Pass"? Wish kid, fatal strep throat, coming through. (coughs) Nope. I'm detective Brenda Lee Johnson. There's been a m*rder backstage. No one gets through the door. (yelling) (grunts) Look, I get it. I'd love to let you back there. I can see the pain in your face. That pain doesn't go away; It only gets worse. Don't get older. Hot dogs. No, no, wait. Oh, yep, yep, this one's hot. (sighs) We're ready to go, Zeke. Where's Leslie? He's using his shirt money to buy an endangered box turtle from the tour bus driver. Tour bus? But whatever you do, don't feed him after midnight. Just kidding. He doesn't know what time it is. What is he, wearing a watch? Hey, cuz. Look who just joined the family. He lives in a shell and he's cute as hell. Cool. Hey, bus driver, what other endangered animals you got in there? Well, I got an African egg frog. I got a horseshoe bat. Got a skink and a skunk. Got a bush baby... How much you want for that bush baby? Not for sale. Come on. But buy the skink, I'll throw in the skunk. I want Griffin to sign the inside of my eyelids, so he's the last thing I see before I go to bed. What are you going to ask Boo Boo to sign? Oh, no, Tina. I don't want Boo Boo's signature. I told you, I want to slap him. I don't know if he'll like that. That's why it has to be a surprise attack. We need to find some place to burst out of. In there? Uh, great idea, but just in case we aren't six inches tall, how about in... there? Ah, smells horrible in here. Yeah. It would be terrible if these smells got stuck to the inside of my nostrils and I would have to smell this sweaty sweatband forever. (sniffs) I think they're coming. I'll slap Boo Boo in the face, and we'll be on our way. Crush crushed. Whew. Great show, guys. Yeah. We caused a lot of smiles tonight. Totally. Settle in guys. We've got an overnighter. I think we're moving. Oh, my God. We're going on tour. Slapabama, here we come. Should we jump out now? What's the protocol in this situation? Maybe you shouldn't rush into this, Louise. We could just live in here forever. Bus Driver: All right, Boo Boo. We got to strap you into your booster seat. No! I don't wanna! You know the rules: When you hit 80 pounds, you can sit in a big boy seat. No! Guys, why don't you sing the song? (others sigh)  Gettin' into your booster seat  From your big boy head to your big boy feet  Gettin' into your booster seat...  What the hell is going on?  I don't know. Is "booster seat" code for drugs?  From my big boy head to my big boy feet  (Boo Boo chuckles) Boo Boo! (all scream) Ah! It's a girl! A girl saw me in my booster seat! Don't look at me! (yelling) Stop the bus, Jody. Tina: No, Jody, don't stop the bus. Who said that? No one. You were just thinking it. We got another one in the hamper. Stopping the bus. Hi. I'm Tina, your new roadie. Do I have something on my face? Just kidding. I know it's five sweatbands. We'll let you off at this rest stop up ahead. Hey, use the phone. Call your parents. They're probably worried about you. I know I'd be worried about my daughter. If I had one. But I'm 17, so I don't. Wait. Before we go, Boo Boo, my sister wants to ask you something. (mumbles) What? (mumbles) What? It sounded like... (mumbles) (mumbles) What? What? What are you saying? What? What? Get me out of this thing! I'm trying to talk to a fan. Give me just a little dignity. (sighs) Thank you. Now, what was that, little girl? (grunting) (groans) Bold. Worth it. I think we nailed it. Yeah. It's daring, it's different. Nobody else is doing this. I'll just put a little more of this strawberry jam from Mom's purse and... done. Ugh. Look at their table. Nerd alert. Am I right? Bob: Yeah. Earth to those guys: You lose. You guys, we didn't give up like we usually do, and I think it really paid off. I'm proud of us. All right, here comes the judge. Good luck, Gene. Go get 'em, Gene Bean. Yeah! Eh? Oh, good Lord. Welcome to my "Menstru-rant." I thought we decided on "Period Piece." Hope you brought your appetite, and your hot flashes. Okay, I think I've seen enough. As you'll see, beside the plate is a sanitary napkin. May I place it on your lap in case there's a big spill? No. I... Please, let me. Get away. It's got wings. Show her the tampon straw. Judge: No. I don't want to see the tampon straw. Someone's on the rag. Well, at least those two got creamed, too. (crying): Oh, God... Dad, do I have to do this again? Yes. Them losing is like us winning. Yeah, and we got fourth place. I mean, I don't think any of our kids have gotten fourth place in anything. I'm number four! I'm number four! Ooh, I got an idea for next year. Baby Jessica stuck in a well. Yes! You have to look for your dinner for two days as the nation watches. Tina: Thanks for coming to get us, Aunt Gayle. It was the least I could do. The good news is my cat is going to be fine. He just has to wear goggles from now on in case it happens again. (meows) Tina, if that's what your life is like, God, how are you even alive? What do you mean? You have a crush on almost every boy you know. How do you do it? Feeling that way for three hours was way too much for me. I'm no hero. I put my bra on one boob at a time like everyone else. Well, the good news is that now that I got it out of my system, I'm done having crushes forever. I hope for your sake you're right. But if not, you know where I live. You're a strong woman, Tina. I know. Good night, Tina. Night, Mom. Night, Louise. Did you guys have fun today? Pretty dull. Aw. (makes kissing sounds) Ugh. Disgusting. I hate you so freaking much, you idiot. Slap.  I want to hear your secrets  I'm so interested in you  What did you have for lunch today?  Tell me breakfast, too  Which friend are you mad at, girl?  What size are your shoes?  You just went to the bathroom, number one or number two?  I want to know everything, everything about you  I want to hear your secrets  I'm so interested in you  Even if it's not a secret  Tell me that stuff, too  Details, I want to know details  What's your dad's name?  Details, details  And your mom's  Any allergies?  Details  How was prom?  Interesting, so interesting. 
You look adorable. Ah, all ready for your big field trip to the museum. You happy now? Very... thank you for volunteering to volunteer. Yeah, so we're even. Well, I've been a parent volunteer for eight years, and this is the first time you're doing it, but, yeah, fine, we're even. (laughs) Great... so, how did you survive eight years of being stuck with Mr. Frond? Wine Thermos. Hmm. Get a cyanide Thermos since you're gonna want to k*ll yourself because field trips are dumb! I agree... field trips are dumb. I remember being a kid, going to the zoo, and sneaking off with Warren Fitzgerald. We smoked cigarettes in front of the zebras. Half-smoked. I didn't really smoke. Start your story over... I just got here. Aw, you didn't care about seeing the animals? It was a pretty crappy zoo. Yeah, it's a pretty crappy museum, too. And we go there every year. I like it. Me, too. The Sands from Exotic Lands exhibit is my favorite. Last year when I got home, there was sand in my crack. It was hands-on learning for my butt. I bet we all have a good Sands from Exotic Lands story. (groans) I'm already bored. Hey, sometimes good things come from boredom. Like Gene. Thank you. And Tina. Pow. Okay, people, take a look at my buddy board and find your randomly assigned buddy. (both screaming) Okay, oh, uh, wait, wait. Hey, hey. Oh, look, Andy and Ollie got assigned to each other. What are the odds? Yay! Yay! And I got... Me. (laughs) I got a Genie in a bottle. Hey, if I rub you, will you give me a wish? No. Hey, I heard you can see boobies from all around the world in this museum if you know where to look. We're going on a booby bender. Boobity-boobity-a-la-la-la. (giggling) (makes fart sound) This I could get used to. Deedlup. Rudolph Steiblitz? Wait, is that Regular-Sized Rudy or Pocket-Sized Rudy? Regular-Sized Rudy. Oh, thank God. POCKET-SIZED RUDY: Hey, what's the big idea? Geez, Rudy, quit sneaking up on people. Wear a bell. God, I have Henry Haber... the school weirdo. Great, I have Tina Belcher. The dorkiest girl in the school. (both groan) You know what? Maybe I'll show him how to be cooler. People used to think I was a weirdo, too. You know what? Maybe she just needs someone to show her how to be cool. People used to say I was a dork, too. Both: This'll be fun. Teddy: So, where's Bob today? On a field trip with the kids. At the museum. I guilted him into going. You miss him, huh? The thing is, he's still here. Don't you see? He's me. He's you, he's that spatula. Aw. Sure, it's a crappy restaurant and people walk right by it, never take notice. Wait, what? The floor's always sticky. Sticky? But it's home for a lot of folks. I'm getting choked up here. Okay... the thing is, now that I made Bob go, I feel like those kids don't need me anymore. Now he gets to play mama bird. Singing the songs on the bus... Linda. Holding hands... Linda, what are you doing here? What? What? Go to them! Oh, oh! Go to the museum. Be with your babies, go to them! I got to go, I got to go! We'll be fine. I'm waiting on... on fries. Lock the door, Linda! Get out! Why are we going? Lock the door. Go! Never look back, never look back! What you drawing there, Henry? I'm designing robot characters for my next graphic novel. It's part of a series. It's important to have interests, but maybe you can find one a little less dorky? Uh, it's actually pretty cool. Maybe you just don't understand it? Oh, I understand it. There's 17 installments, and you really need to read them in order, which you haven't, so I doubt it. Both: This is going to be harder than I thought. Tina: Robots? But that does give me an idea for my next erotic fan fiction: Ro-butts. (metal clanging) Hey, what's that noise? My cymbals... you never know when somebody's gonna want to jam. Hmm, back me up with those, would you? Well, okay, but I haven't... Hey, Mr. Frond. Why did the chicken cross the road? I don't know, Louise, why? So he would be in a different school district where there's a different guidance counselor. Hiya! Yeah! Louise. What? Don't say that here. That's fine... I'm out of material. Ooh, is there a rat exhibit? I think those are picketers. Picketers? Even the people who get paid to go in there don't want to be in there! That's how terrible it is! It's a good thing your mom isn't here. Why, Mom likes protesting? What? No, she loves chanting. Oh, who doesn't? Yah, tah, yah-tah-tah! Hi, Madeline Greenberg, museum director. Phillip Frond, counselor of children, friend of the museum. I'm Bob, I, uh... He's merely a volunteer. Oh. Well, you may have noticed, we're having a little trouble with the UFMWD? I've had problems with that. Drink some cranberry juice. Hmm, no, it's the United Federation of Museum Workers and Docents. They're on strike. Oh, like how my stepmom's on a s*x strike till my dad fixes the VCR. Exactly, it hasn't affected much. We still have all the exhibits, all the fun, just one-eighth of the staff. (laughs) Louise: An Amazon exhibit? Maybe this day won't suck so bad after all. Oh, that's not open. What?! No! The strike slowed us down there a little. (mumbles) Henry and Tina: Whoa. Nice plesiosaur. Nice horses. What'd you say? Plesiosaur. The coolest dinosaur. Hmm... Henry, it's great that you have a favorite animal, but what about picking a cooler animal? Like a horse or miniature horse? Uh... It's your first time as a parent volunteer, Bob. Linda's set the bar pretty high. I hope you're up to it. With great vest comes great responsibility. Ugh. Okay, kids, stick with your buddy and stay with the group! You don't want to be a Missing Marvin or a Walk-Away Wendy! Ugh... huh? Okay, Regular-Sized Rudy, change of plans. I'm going in there, and you're coming with me. Yeah, I don't think we're allowed to do that... Oh, we're not. Oh. We're going where no Wagstaff student has ever gone: The Amazon! Rudy, just keep your voice down. Oh... Amazon? Yes, ma'am-azon! Ha! Shush! Shush! (whispering): Sorry. Yes, ma'am-azon. I'm glad you're up for this, Rudy. I thought I was gonna have to get a buddy-ectomy. Are you kidding? This is great. I've never done anything like this. My mom barely let me go on this field trip. (clanging) Ugh! Okay, I know you're new here, but this isn't how sneaking works. You have to ditch the backpack. Yeah, sure. No! (cymbals crash) I didn't mean throw it. That was loud. Okay, I'll show you the ropes, and then we're gonna go under the ropes and touch all the stuff. Yeah.  I need to blow my nose. Uh, okay. I can only blow it if you hold it. Ugh. (moaning) (grunts) Now me. Oh, my God. (blows nose) Bob? Time for a head count. Uh... oh. Four, eight, ten, (nose blowing continues) 14, 16... I'm gonna push you now, Ollie. I'm gonna push you away now. I understand. Uh, uh, okay, who's missing? Oh, man. Louise. Figures. A-Are we good? Uh, uh-huh. Yeah. Definitely. I just got to go over here for a second. Be right back! Of course she's in there. Louise. Louise. (animal noises) Louise, come out of the plants. (high voice): Who's Louise? I'm just a talking plant. My name is Leafy Greenbrier. Rudy: And I am Kate Bush. Listen, both of you. I know you're not excited about this museum, but I can't have you kids being Missing Marvins or whatever that stupid thing Frond said. Walk-Away Wendys. Thank you. Uh-huh. Um, what's your name? Regular-Sized Rudy. Regular-Sized Rudy? Why do they call you that? Just look at me. Um, okay. Listen, you two are supposed to stay with the group. Ugh. Dad, when I hear "stay with the group," I leave the group. Yeah, Louise, that can be annoying. All right, which way did we come in? Uh, come on, this way. No, you come on. Dad, look around. We're in the jungle. Ah! Can we just for a second walk around a little? Hmm. It is kind of impressive. Yeah. But we both know I have to take you guys back. You remind me of my mom. She hates fun, too. (whistling) Hide. Get down. Hey! Who's over there? Shh-shh-shush. Somebody over there? Everybody shut up. Hello? Come on, Jeff, you know I hate plants. Oh, they're gonna drop their juice boxes when they see me. (indistinct shouting) Museum management is unfair and anti-union. Yeah, I hear that, buddy. No, no, we're protesting. What do we want? Others: Fairness. Woman: When do we want it? Others: Now. Oof. What? The chant? Well, uh... It's the chant, isn't it? Yeah. You got to wow 'em. Something like, uh... Give us more money, damn it! Or we'll shave the woolly mammoth! Give us longer breaks for snacks or we'll burn the artifacts! You're really good at this. Thank you. All right, good luck, got to go. No, wait. We need you. Hmm? Remember, kids, smiling is the new touching. Nice. Also, if you ignore history, you're doomed to repeat it, and if you touch history, you will be suspended for six days. Yes... and when you get to the pioneer exhibit, learn but don't churn. Who are you? Is there a, uh... Mr. Museum? No, there is not. Okay, booby checklist. Let's see what we got. Did you get that at the gift shop? Nope, it's my cousin's. He wrote down where to find all the boobs in the museum. Viking boobies, yeah! Eskimo boobies, coming real soon. It's an embarrassment of boobies. (Zeke and Jimmy chuckle) Good one, Zeke. That's Jimmy Jr. You may not know him because he's one of the cooler kids in school. Hi, Jimmy Jr. Hi, Tina. (laughs, snorts) I know Jimmy Jr. Hey, Jimmy J. Hey, Harvey. Hen-Henry. He's always joking like... uh, not even my name, uh... (plants rustle) Okay, I think the coast is clear. Let's get back to the group. But we just hid from the guard. We're having fun here, ah? Come on, let's go into the stilt hut just so we can say we did it, and then we can go back to the boring group and that no-fun Frond and have a crappy day just like you want. Please. Louise: It's literally a hut on stilts. (sighs) Fine. Stilt hut and then that's it. Stilt hut!   Stilt hut! Shh. Stilt hut! Shh-shh-shush. Rudy... rookie. I know. (whispering): Now we're all whispering. So nothing for you to check off here, Zeke. They all have hair covering their boobs. Like a stupid fashion magazine, right? But not so fast. And three... two... ta-ta time. No nip, though. Wow. Your cousin's really into this. I never heard of anyone having a boob fetish. Well, this isn't even remotely realistic. I mean, the stegosaurus... Henry. What did I say about dinosaurs? Why are you talking that way? I'm just trying to help you, Henry, okay, buddy? And I'm just trying to help you, buddy. All I'm saying is, the stegosaurus... it's obviously... Uh-uh, honey. Huh? No. What a dork. Both: I know. Whoa, whoa. You think I'm the dork? Of course. Everyone does. No, no, no, no, you're the dork. Huh. Well, there's only one way to solve this. Well, there's probably, like, a lot of different ways. But why don't we try your dorky way? Yeah, well, 'cause it's not the dorky way. Can you just, it... drop the dork and just talk to me? (sighs) You look so dorky right now. Linda: Make our paycheck more colossal! Picketers: Or we'll poop on all the fossils! Yes. Rude. Well, great stilt hut. Yeah. The best. Now, let's go back. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. The stilt hut was my fun jungle idea. Now... what's, what-what's one from you? What do you got? Um, go back. Don't say "go back." Warren Fitzgerald wouldn't say go back. Warren Fitzgerald would say you've gone soft. Warren Fitzgerald? From my zebra story? Yeah. From your fun past. I've got ideas, but... I don't believe you have ideas unless you say them out loud. Yes, of course I have ideas. If I look around, I could come up with something. Okay, well, then look around and come up with something. Okay, there. We're gonna go right there. (Louise chuckling) Look who's stepping up. But, uh, how are we gonna get up there? We could fly. I know we can't fly. We could just do this. Huh? Who's soft now, Louise? Your stomach, your butt, and your thighs. But nice work. Let's go! (Rudy and Bob grunting) (humming) Mr. Softie just pushed over a tree. I like it. Hey, shake a leg, Reg Size. (panting): I'll be right there. And Mom said I'd never climb a tree. All right, race you to the top. Let's do it! First one up gets to spit down on the other. Don't worry, Rudy, we're not gonna spit on you. (chuckles) As long as I'm included. Ooh, ooh. Look! Camel boobies. Those are humps. One man's hump... Okay, students, buddy up. In a few moments we'll proceed to the hands-on room of the museum. Oh, finally! Yay! Sands from Exotic Lands! Sand? Really? That's what floats your scrote? And then some. Mmm, the hands-on room. It's the one place you're allowed to touch. (shudders) Your skin should be its own exhibit. Well, your hair should be sent to an Asian wig factory. Oh. Who's a bigger dork, Henry Haber or me? You. Henry. Not helpful. Bigger dork, me or Henry? Tina. Henry. Well, looks like we're dork-locked. (sighs) We need fresh eyes. Hello, I'm Tina and this is Henry. I'm Henry. (sighs) Yeah. Who do you think is the bigger dork? Um, I don't think you kids should play this game. Labels lead to hurt feelings. Sheesh. Never ask a dork to judge a dork contest. Yeah. (pants) Come on. Pick up the pace, softie. Softie? That's funny coming from the girl who called me Daddy until she was eight. What? That's crazy. You better have a good lawyer, 'cause that is slander, sir. (wheezing) That's me laughing. (wheezing laugh) Time to kick it up a notch, okay? Boom, chaka, boom, chaka, boom, boom, boom! Others: Boom, chaka, boom, chaka, boom, boom, boom! Weeda, weeda, weina, weina, weina, wang. Others: Weeda, weeda, weina, weina, weina, wang. Shake your hips! Wiggle your butt! Drop your pants and pick 'em back up! No. I don't want to drop my pants. Why? (pants) Ha! We did it! You know what? I am gonna spit. (hocks loogie, spits) Hey, I'm glad we ditched. That was fun. Me, too. Let's do it again sometime. Like, maybe when you're old and senile, I'll close the restaurant and come spring you from the nursing home. What? Sorry, I didn't want to do it, but Gene and Tina put you in a nursing home. And not one of the nice ones either. No, you said you'd be running the restaurant. Oh, no, I was just saying... You're taking over the family business? (scoffs) Yeah, right. Ha! Admit it, you look up to me. No! S... (groans) You are ruining our perfect day right now! Oh, my God, am I your hero? (groans) Sick! (wheezing) Fun... hurts... my lungs. Wow. I thought I was out of shape. Man: What the... Oh! Shh, shh, shh. This doesn't go here. (grunts) Disgusting tree. Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew! Whoa. That's gonna make getting down a lot harder. Oh, crap, crap, crap. We're stuck up here. This was a stupid idea. (wheezing) Um, Rudy, are you okay? Haven't gone this long (wheeze) without my inhaler. Inhaler? I'm supposed to use it every two hours (wheeze) or I could die. What? (wheezing): But I'm sick of that thing. O-Okay. Where's your inhaler? In... my... backpack. Where's your backpack? Um, I made him ditch it. What? But don't worry about me. (inhales deeply) I'm loving every minute of this. Oh, my God. Wait! Security guy! Come back! Help! Help! Louise: Why didn't you tell me you need your inhaler? I'm your buddy. We're supposed to talk. We talk. This is why you can't just do whatever you want, Louise, there are consequences. You shouldn't have left the group. And I shouldn't have let you talk me into doing this! So it's your fault? No! Right now we just have to get Rudy his inhaler! (wheezing) How are we gonna get down? That tree was our ladder. I know that tree was our ladder! I put it there! (weakly): I think I'm coming around. (wheeze) I think I'm getting better. Nope! Getting worse. (gurgling): Getting worse. Oh. Oh, boy. Uh, CPR. I know how to give CPR. No, thank you. Uh, wh-why don't I just try it? And if you hate it, I'll stop. No! Yeah, okay, you're right. Just hold on. I have an idea. What? Wish me luck. Wh-What are you doing? Maybe the bravest and dumbest thing I've ever done. This is for you, Warren Fitzgerald! And you, too, Rudy. Cool. Whoa! (Louise shouting) (screams) Dad! (grunts) Whoa! That was amazing! Hello, sand. You remember these hands? (moans) We're finally done with boobs! Oh, Gene, you're never done with boobs. They're everywhere you look! Mountains, speed bumps... Hell, you just made a nice pair yourself, Cool Breeze. (shouts) You've ruined sand! Tina: Darn it. We still haven't settled this. I don't get it. Why would anyone think I'm a dork? Well, what makes me a dork? Well, um, you're a dork for plesiosaurs. And your comic book. Graphic novel. But, yes, I also dabble in comic books, action figures, and stickers. Yeah. See? Well, you're a dork for horses. Huh, I am. Among other things. Hmm. I guess we're both dorks in our own way. Everyone! I have an announcement. You're probably all wondering how the voting came out in the Tina/Henry dork controversy. Others: No. Well, the verdict is in. I'm a dork. For boys and horses and zombies. And I'm a dork for dinosaurs and my series of graphic novels. I guess I'm a dork for dancing. (grunting) Okay, then I'm a dork for sand. Guess that makes me a dork for boobs. I'm a dork for Ollie. I'm a dork for Andy! And I'm a dork for bargain Chardonnays (quietly): And being asked out by handsome guidance counselors. What about you, Mr. Frond? I'm a dork for getting on the bus on time. Get your buddies and let's go! (quietly): Call me. Oh! If my mother answers, hang up. Oh. We might be dorks for different things, but at our cores, we're all... the same. I made a very good point. Let's all go now. Boys are from Mars, girls are from Venus. I've got a yum-yum, you've got a pen1s. Uh, Linda? What? Ow. What? Uh, we've been talking, and we want you to leave. Wha... (gasps) Really! You want me to leave? Yeah. Well, chant for it. Oh, wait. I'm sorry. That's right. You can't chant! Ha! (wheezing) How many pumps? L-Let me read the instructions. Oh, what, you're worried he's gonna breathe too well? Come on! Fine! (inhales deeply, sighs) Thank you. (groans) Buddy. Oh, I hate you. But I love air. So I guess we're stuck together. Let me get a puff of that. Man: Hey! You're not allowed to be in here. What's going on?! Uh, we're, uh... Run! Man: What do we want? Others: Linda gone! When do we want it? Others: Now! Linda Belcher's here to stay! I don't work here anyway! Boo! Oh, my face! (jeering) Louise: Scabs! Scabs are coming! Let's get 'em! They'll do anything for a dollar! (panting): Did you come to surprise us, but then you got caught up in the chanting? Yep. Did Louise get you in trouble with security? Yep. See you at home? Yep. Uh-oh. I'm missing two. Here they are. Two here. (wheezes) Oh. Regular-Sized Rudy, I detect a bit of wheeze. He needs an inhaler every two hours or he'll die. Yeah. I-I heard about that. Oh, uh, here's your vest. (screams) What did you do to it?! It was like this when I got it. Gene! Tina! How was your day? Dorky. Booby. Great, great, glad you had fun. (quietly): I think we're in the clear. Yeah, we got away with it. That's not what you should be taking away from this. Did we get away with it, Rude? Perfect crime. Mmm. I've tasted life, and I'm hungry for more. You do realize you almost made Rudy die. Almost dying is the best part of living. It's called almost-live-dying. (chuckles) So, when you run the restaurant, will you call it Louise's Burgers? I don't know. Maybe. Daddy.  Boom, chaka, boom, chaka, boom, boom, boom  Boom, chaka, boom, chaka, boom, boom, boom  Weeda, weeda, weina, weina, weina, wang  Weeda, weeda, weina, weina, weina, wang  Boys are from Mars, girls are from Venus  I've got a yum-yum, you've got a pen1s  Boys are from Mars  Girls are from Venus  I've got a yum-yum, you've got a pen1s  Boom, chaka, boom, chaka, wang  Boom, chaka, boom, chaka, wang  Weeda, weeda, weina, boom, boom, boom  Weeda, weeda, weina, boom, boom, boom  Chaka, weina, wang, weina, chaka, weina  Chaka, weina, wang, weina, chaka, weina  Boom, chaka, wang, weina, boom, boom  Boom, chaka, wang, weina, boom, boom  Shake your hips, wiggle your butt  Drop your pants, pick 'em back up  Weeda, weeda, weina, chaka, weeda, weeda, weina, chaka  Weeda, weeda, weina, chaka, weeda, weeda... 
my recreation league angel, Gene Belcher! They're baseball pants. Well, they go great with this top. It's also called a jersey, Gene. No. Ease up, everybody, back off. It's his first game. Oh! This is so exciting! I'll show you exciting. Hi-ya! I've got armor for my ding-dong! Come on. That's not how you hit a crotch with a baseball bat. This is how you hit a crotch with a baseball bat. (grunts) Ha-ha-ha! What doesn't break my testicles only makes them stronger! Wow, Gene is really athletic. I love baseball: The pizza parties, the spiky shoes, the parade at the end of the season where we ride on a float. How's my wave? Hi... Hi... Hey, Teddy, do you want an espresso before we close up? A what? An espresso. Huh? Whoa, look at that. Yeah, it was a little pricey, but it's an investment, right? Someone comes in for a burger, they'll say, "Oh, Bob, finally you're selling espresso." Oh, Bobby, it's like that hot plate you bought. You had big dreams for that. Where is it now? It's right there. Oh. Ow, it's hot. Teddy, why don't you try one? It's on the house. Nah. Well, just to see if you like it. I don't wanna, Bob. I'm declining politely. Just take one sh*t, Teddy! I don't like those tiny cups! Just drink one! They make it look like I have giant hands! Come on! Leave me alone! Oh, fine. Really? You're gonna give up that easy? Well, if no one's gonna drink this, maybe I'll just... Ugh, that's terrible. That's... that's... Ooh... Ah... Ooh... Ooh, ah... Oh... ooh... Hey, Tina. Hi, Teddy. Hi. Uh... Huh. Gross, right? Yeah, it's an acquired taste... that I just acquired. Hey, batter, batter, batter, hey, batter, batter, batter, hey, batter, batter, batter, batter, batter, batter, hey, hey, hey, hey! Umpire: Strike three! You're out. Ha-ha! I made that kid strike out. I did that! I'm part of this! Which one's yours? Oh, he's down there in the dugout entertaining the troops. Normal Gene. Evil Gene. Normal Gene. Evil Gene. (grunts) I think I can hear my hair growing, especially the bangs. Hey, maybe that's why they call them bangs. Hey, keep it down. How many espressos have you had? Just one. I'm being really interesting right now, I can tell. Usually my personality is a little flat. Did you ever pick up on that? That you have a personality? No. How we doing, Coach? Have you played all your kids? Uh, yeah, I think I got 'em all. Pretty much. Yeah, I got 'em all. Yeah, I think, I think so, yeah. What about Belly Bongo? Come on. I played my girl. I'm a boy. You got to play Belly Bongo, Coach. (sighs) All right, Gene, you're in. What about urine? Grab a bat. Done. Now what? Sometimes with Jimmy Jr., I don't know what to say. But now I don't know what not to say. I have all these thoughts, and it's like, "Okay, guys, who can get to my mouth first?" I think I love Espresso Tina. Thanks. I think Jimmy Jr. will, too. Oh, Gene's going up to bat! Yay! Go, Gene, go! Whoo! Why does he have to play now? The game's tied. Gene doesn't even thrive under no pressure. Okay, just roll it at me as slowly as you feel like. Oh, God. Aah! Strike one, strike two, strike three! I surrender! He's a, a little tentative out there. He kind of got a piece of it, right? Not really. No, no, he didn't. (screams) (bat smacks) (grunts) Ow! (panting) It's not your fault you lost, sweetie. It's his fault. Hey! Button it, you seventh inning bi... Oh, Gene, oh, you played! Wasn't it fun? I hate baseball! I hate it! (grunting) Gene, wait! (grunts) Oh, nice slide, honey! Linda: It's not that bad, Gene. You made some errors, you struck out, one or two people booed. Louise. To be fair, I also laughed. That's it! I'll never set foot on a baseball field again except as a streaker! I quit! If you quit, you'd be a quitter. That's worse than being a loser. Well, let's not dismiss the quitting idea. Bob! What? It has a quiet dignity to it. Quiet dignity? Have you met us?! Uh, Bob, what's the Burger of the Day? I'm looking at an empty chalkboard here. Well, it's something with gouda cheese. I'm still trying to come up with a name for it. Woulda Coulda Gouda. You Gouda Be Kidding Me. As Gouda As it Gets. Gouda Gouda Gumdrops. A Few Gouda Men. Gouda Gouda Two Shoes... comes with shoes. Gouda Day, Sir. Uh, Tina, no more espresso for you. There goes Jimmy Jr. Hey, Jimmy Jr., I see you're riding a bicycle. Do you know they call it a bicycle because "bi" means two? Speaking of two, there's two of us. Do you want to go on a date, by the way? Uh, okay. What's good for you? How about tomorrow at 5:00 a.m.? I know I'll be up. Uh... Great. So it's a date. I'll see you then. We'll get coffee. Oops, wrong way. Eh... We're gonna turn this sinking ship around. You just need a little extra coaching. Right, Bob? Bob? Huh? Coaching. A little extra coaching. In? Baseball! From? You! Oh! Right. For Gene. Sure. Yes, you. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Ah... I probably should have been playing catch with you for years. Then you'd be good at it. It's so beautiful here. Dad, is this Heaven? It's not Heaven, but the, but the lighting is nice, right? It's a nice time of day. You know, when I saw you playing the game, it looked to me like you were a little afraid of the ball. The stitches remind me of Frankenstein! All right, I'm gonna toss it to you easy, Gene, okay? It's getting hard to see, so let me know when you throw it. Uh-oh. Oh! You hit me in the nose! I'm sorry! I said I was gonna throw it. (groans) Here, you can have a free throw at me. Ow! I thought you couldn't throw! I was aiming at your feet! Ow! Stop it, Gene! That time I aimed at your face! All right, how about this? (grunts) (both grunting) Aah! Don't throw that! Do not throw that! Hey, look at this. I Yahoogled "boy needs baseball help, father-son fail unathletic hopeless turquoise jewelry." Why turquoise jewelry? 'Cause I've been looking for some. It's coming back. Anyway, look what came up. "The Deuce of Diamonds' Diamonds in the Rough in the Diamond Baseball Camp." It's rated four diamonds! Hello there, ballers. I'm the Deuce of Diamonds! Hey, I know him. He used to be the Prince of Persuasia. The Prince of whosia? A teacher of the ancient art of seduction. Dr. Yap had his video. I learned so much. But now I have something better, a magic black bean. A what? Nothing. What's holding you back from maximum baseball excellence? Guess what was standing in my way. I was. Wow, that's deep. Deeply dumb. Shh! I was striking myself out. Then I unlocked the baseball awesomeness inside my body. Now look at me. He didn't do that. Check out these incredible results from my one-day Diamonds in the Rough in the Diamond Baseball Camp. Now he's Deucing it. Now they're all Deucing it. Ooh, look at this. The Deuce is holding his camp in town tomorrow! And it's only $495. $495 for that? That's crazy. For that kind of money, he should throw in $495. Don't be a cheapskate, Bob. Do you love Gene or not? Of course I love Gene. Ew! Then we're spending $495. We don't have it! Oh, go fart in a fortune cookie. No fair! I can't have $495, but Tina can have all the glasses she wants?! Ugh! Let's discuss this over a frothy espresso. I'll go make it. No more espresso, Tina. I'm gonna lock her in her room. Tina: No. Ah, maybe I could sell something valuable. I got a Spanish edition of Fifty Shades of Grey I found on a bus. Cincuenta Sombras de Grey. Don't tell your father. You could sell your soul. I did, and look at me, I'm fine. (gasps) I have something more precious than my soul. Linda: And this one and this one. Good-bye. Ooh, and this one. Okay. Bye-bye. Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, okay. And this one. Oh, no-no-no, not that one. Not that. I don't know how that got in there. Okay. Wait, wait. A couple more. Bye. Go. Okay. Look, I need $495. Plus that derringer. Look, the kitsch craze is kind of played out. No one likes babies. What? Who doesn't? What? I got a shelf of 'em. Oh! Look at that one! Let me see that one! (clears throat) Uh, Mom. What? Oh. Going in the wrong direction. I'm sorry. Maybe if you had some fine art or antique coins or firearms. Or high-end restaurant equipment? Talk to me. What about the...? (gasps) Ah... (grunts) Stealing and pawning. I feel so dirty! I told you you'd like crime, Mom. Eh... yeah, I do. Wounder why dad changes his mind about me going to the Deuce of Diamonds' Baseball Camp? Well, because he loves you. But you don't let him know that you know, all right? He doesn't like to talk about his feelings. He's all stunted inside like a big dumb man, all right? It's our little secret, okay? Just like our Sunday mani-pedis. Oh, look, there he is! Hi, The Deuce. This is Gene. I've got the heart of a baseball player but the body of a manager. Office manager. No problem, that's what we're here for. Baseball is all I do. The Closer of Close-Up Magic. Don't worry about that. The lceman of lnkjet Printer Repair? Those are just... in my trunk. Now, about the tuition... Ah! It wasn't easy, but I got it all. Great, cash! I mean, checks are so formal. It's a lot of money. But you guarantee results, right, Deuce? You better write your name on this little guy because you're not gonna recognize him when you pick him up. Ha-ha! I'm gonna have a k*ller fastball and a magnificent perm. Whoo! I'm gonna have a hot dog. Hey-hey-hey, Jimmy Pesto! Hi, Linda. Thanks for the heads up about the baseball camp. Isn't it great? Last chance to earn my love, guys. (laughs) I love that joke. Okay, guys, let's get started. I'm gonna count these checks, and you guys are gonna inject yourself with some performance-enhancing enthusiasm! All: Yay! I am going to be athletic. How you doing, Tina? You seem a little logy. Well, you seem a little shut your face. Whoa. Tina! It's her first day since I cut her off espresso, so... Yeah, when you dance with the bear, you can't stop until the bear wants to stop. Espresso's the bear. Come on, Dad. Just let me bite down on a bean! No! No espresso! You can't have any and your father can't sell any. And, uh, I mean, he's allowed to, he just never, ever will. So end of subject. Uh, ooh, look at the sky. You know what? I've been thinking about it. Maybe I should try it. Broaden my horizons. No, don't! I-I saw a report. It'll shrink your pen1s. Yeah, it'll shrink it. One study says it'll shrink, the other says it'll grow. You got to just live your life. Set me up, Bob. My first sale. (Linda groans) We never thought he'd actually sell one. I just got to take off the dust cover. Take off that dust cover. (Bob and Tina screaming) Where is it?! Oh, my God, it's gone. Oh, how odd. Okay, guys, listen up. Your glove is your best friend. But you are not its best friend. You're its boss and you are pissed off. Now punish your glove. Pound it. Make it afraid to miss a ball ever. (grunting) You've got to start meeting your performance goals! When you change your attitude, you change your batitude. So swing away. Uh, Mr. The Deuce, you don't have a baseball. If we played with a real ball, we'd spend half the day running after it. It's all in your mind. Whoa. Wow. (whooshing) (hitting noise) That's a double in the gap. (chuckles)   (whooshing) (hitting noise) Home run. Ooh! (hitting noise) Broken bat, single. (gasps) I'll need a pinch runner. What's that, kid? (wheezing): I said I'm gonna need a pinch runner. Speak up, please. (wheezing) (whooshing) (hitting noise) Long fly ball. This could go. Oh, no, caught at the wall. No! By you. You hit it, you caught it. Amazing over-the-shoulder catch. I was robbed. By me. An espresso machine doesn't just walk away. Where are you, you big, beautiful silver b*st*rd? Who would do this? (door chimes ring) Hi, Tina. What, what, what?! I just... I was saying hi. 'Cause I just walked in, so... what do you mean, what? Oh, my God, I never noticed how annoying you are. I can't even understand what you're saying. Oh, I have a speech impediment, Tina. Well, fix it. Hey, where's Gene? Ah, Gene, Gene, Gene. That's all you ever talk about. What about me? Look at me. Gene's at that baseball thing. My brothers are there, too. What?! Oh, that's right. Uh, Gene's at, uh... (mumbling): Deuce of Diamonds' Baseball Camp. Playing baseball. (panting) Okay, cross home. Tip your cap. Chest bump the guy on deck, and that's a home run ot. Okay, any questions so far? About anything at all. Girls, boys, life, money, inkjet printer repair. Um, can I be a good baseball player... (wheezing): ...with asthma? Rudy, I'm gonna tell you a story. A famous baseball player... whose name I can't remember right now... had Lou Gehrig's Disease and he didn't let it slow him down. That was inspiring. Um, can Ollie and I be umpires? Yes, you can. You're out of there! You're out of there! You're out of there! You're out of there! The Deuce, will I ever get over being scared of the ball? Gene, listen to me. You are so much bigger and rounder than that ball, it should be scared of you. (high voice): Oh, no, it's Gene. I won't hurt you, baseball. That's okay. It's your job to hit me over the fence. I love you so much, Gene. Aw. (phone rings) Hold on, getting a call. Ugh, Mr. You Owe Me $1,100 Manoogian. That is a long first name and a long last name. Hey, Mr. Manoogian. Well, I've been trying to reach you, too. Uh-huh, I see. Yes, sir. Okay. Well, I could pay the bill now, so you can go ahead and not put my stuff out on the street. I'm sorry, it's how much? Minibar? That's where they get you. All right, well, you know what? Then I'm coming down there. And I'm bringing some of my people. Okay, guys, listen up. Um, sometimes in baseball you go on a road trip. So let's practice piling into the team bus over there. Now, everybody grab a bat. Bob: Linda, look at me. How did you pay for baseball camp? Uh... I, uh, I sold my porcelain babies. Wait, I saw those when I was tearing the place apart. So you didn't sell them! Those are my backup babies. Yeah, that's the B-team. Look how ugly they are. You can do this the easy way or the hard way. (porcelain shatters) Tina! Do you think I'm playing here? (exclaims) I need that espresso machine back... oh, my head. (giggling) Hi, Tina, I think you're more into espresso than you are into me. (screams) It's true. I love espresso, coffee, caffeinated teas, and then Jimmy Jr. In that order. All right, I did it. I sold the espresso machine. (sighs) That machine was the crown jewel of this restaurant, Linda. It was made in Turin, Italy. That's where they make... Fiats! Big whoop. It was a waste of money. I'd rather waste money on Gene. You don't even know if this Deuce is legit. He has a Web site. Yeah, they don't just give those out. We're going down there and we're coming back with our money. Or a really good baseball player. I hope neither of you are getting your hopes up. Tina, break another one. That one. Oh, no. The Deuce: Okay, we're here. Everybody out. Hey, this is where our dad goes for his naps. Hi, Mr. Manoogian! Oh, crap. Hey, hey, hey, hey! No, no, no, too late! Listen. Come on! You're too late! Come on, man. Not cool! You're not cool! Now, listen. I don't have the whole $1,100 in cash. (groans): Oh... But I can sign over some checks. Now, this one has a flag on it, and patriotic checks never bounce. No, no, no, I don't need your stupid flag checks, okay?! Pay me now, or I'm keeping your DVD player. It's not a DVD player, it's a Blu-ray player that also plays DVDs! Well, then, that makes it a DVD player! No, it doesn't! Hey, how much for this hot pot? This is not a yard sale. Three dollars. Okay, it is a yard sale. Linda: Well, they were here. Bob: Oh, that's great, so this guy... The Deuce... just takes off somewhere with all the kids? Look, he left that gym bag. See, we've got bath towels from the Sand Flea motel and some crumbled deodorant in a baggy. See, that's valuable. He's got to come back for that. Oh, my God, Lin, I don't want to sit around waiting for him. Let's go to the Sand Flea. Yeah, we shouldn't even stop for coffee. But let's stop for coffee. Manoogian: Okay, this isn't enough. You're still way short. Sorry I couldn't move the tube socks. Okay, fine! If that's how you want to play it, we're just gonna take some swings... at your soda machine. Go to it, guys. But isn't that vandalism? Babe Ruth used to beat the crap out of a root beer machine. Now look at him. Okay. (grunting) Yeah, there you go. Four-bagger. Grand salami. That's a good looking foul ball right there. Soda, you made me fat, but you also made me strong! Maid cart, get it. I'll come back later. These boys are very weak. I see no damage. They're damaging your pride. Not very much. Bob: Oh, my God, there's Gene. Gene, what are you doing? Playing baseball, and I'm great. (grunts) Look at his swing, Bobby. Poetry in motion. Yeah, slow motion. Some soda's leaking out. It might have caffeine in it. Bob: Tina, don't lick that. Do you folks mind? These practices are closed to parents. Just give us our money back and we'll go. Refund, no. That's not gonna happen. Yeah, that's not gonna happen. Guys, I did everything The Deuce told me to and now I'm excellent at baseball. Gene, this is a scam. Excuse me, The Deuce has ears and feelings. Well, I'm sorry. Well, I forgive you. But now we want our money. Whoa, bro, easy. The next game Gene plays, you'll notice a real diff. Too bad, by then, I'll be setting up my winter camp in Arizona. Deucing in the desert. Aw, you're gonna miss Gene hitting all those home runs. And you're gonna miss the leaves changing. He's not better, Lin. It's not a real baseball camp. He is so better. I wish there was a game right now. He'd show you, buddy. You know, what? A game right now. Let's do that. Yeah, let's do that. Well, let's not rush into anything. Some of my training takes a little time... to sink in. Oh, don't be modest, The Deuce. You know what you're doing. He's gifted; He said so. He's gonna do a TED Talk. Okay, look, I got to go. No, no, no, no, you're not going anywhere. We've got enough people here for a game in that vacant lot right there. Now, if Gene gets a hit... which he won't, because you're a fraud... you keep the money. If not, we get a full refund. That sounds really complicated. I didn't get it either. Play ball! Play ball.  For the land of the free  And the home of the brave.  Okay, first base is The Deuce's baggy of deodorant, second and third are his Rollerblades, and home is his hemorrhoid pillow. Play ball! You can do it, Gene. Get a hit and disappoint your father. Okay. No hit, no hit, no hit, no hit! Come on, Gene. Wait for a big fat one right over the ass pad. The Deuce: Here it comes, Gene. Nothing to be afraid of.  (grunts) (gasps) Oh, my God, you hit it... I mean, of course you hit it, I'm a great coach. Gene hit it. That's a hit. It's n a hit if somebody catches it. Call it, someone. I got it! I got it! Wait, do you want it? No, not if you want it. You can have it. But it sounded like you wanted it. Make up your minds! Both: Let's share it! No, no, don't share it! (grunts) No! Now it's a hit. (grunting) Hey, he's still running. Throw to first. Throw to first base! Ah, you're such a d!ck, Bob. (panting) Ow. That had some mustard on it. For real. No! It's a hit! It's an error, not a hit. Gene got a hit, you jerk. You're blind. Put some lenses in those things! I'm blind to marry you! Why don't you steal home, you thief? You've stolen everything else. You love a coffee machine more than you love your son. Get your finger out of my face. You're out of here, pal! Get your finger out of my face! Stuff it up your crackerjacks! Your fat finger! Hey, there goes The Deuce. Bob: Oh, crap. Oh, no, no, no, no. (sighs) I'm really gonna miss that guy. He gave us his magic and then he disappeared. Just like Toad the Wet Sprocket. Are we going to the pizza party now? No. Oh. Hey, Mr. Belcher, just wait till next year. Don't. Don't do that. What are you doing? Don't do that. (kids cheering) See, Bob, it was all worth it. Gene learned confidence. From a confidence man. I got conned good. And that ain't bad. I guess I'm happy that Gene's happy. But that espresso machine just really made me proud, that's all. That dirty hunk of junk? I'm glad it's gone. It wasn't good for Tina. Where is Tina? (gulping) That pot is a week old. (gulping) I put my cigarettes out in that. (coughs) (gulping) Do you want cream or sugar? ("Electric Boogie" by Marcia Griffiths playing)  You can't see it  It's electric!  You gotta feel it  It's electric!  Ooh, it's shakin'  It's electric!  (singing in Spanish)  She's a-movin' like electric  She sure got the boogie  You gotta know it  It's electric! 
Bob: Ah! (inhales deeply) Air! Come on, kids. Get some of that woodsy air in your lungs. (inhales) Oh, that's pretty woodsy, right? (inhales) Woodsiest I've ever smelled. Bob: Yeah. (inhales) My musk will blend right in. I'm pretty sure camping isn't good for my... (sputters) I don't know, knees? I've got a note around here somewhere. I'll write you a note after I write myself one. Come on, guys. It's not Tina's fault she was sick when her Thundergirl troop went camping. This way, you all get to go on my make-up camping trip. Yay. What do we know about camping? We come from a family of city dwellers. We're all gonna die! Hey, I know plenty about camping. I used to go camping, once, when I was a kid. It's great, from what I remember. Plus, what would you say if I told you I'm carrying a saw in my pocket right now? Is that what you said when you met Mom? Are those nail clippers? It's my Nature Master. It's a multi-tool. It does everything nature requires. Could it k*ll an eagle? Why would we want to k*ll an eagle? I don't know. They're so condescending. Yes! We're k*ll*ing eagles. Actually, my Thundergirl handbook says to leave only footprints, so we probably shouldn't k*ll anything. (groans loudly) Tina: We could go on a 13-smilehike. (Linda groans) There's taking pictures with your mind. (Linda groans) Consensual bird watching. Linda: We don't have to do any of that, do we, Bob? Bob: No. Hiya, folks. You picked a great weekend to camp. You'll all be fine. Um... great. Wait, why'd you say we'll all be fine? Because you will. You'll all be fine. Just mind the river, that's all. It's, uh, high this year. But you'll be fine. And your family will be fine. Okay. ThunderMint? God, no. Keep those in a sealed container. We've had some aggressive wildlife out here lately. Bears? No. Squirrels. Seriously? We've lost some good people recently. To the squirrels? Bears. Linda and Bob: What? (laughs) Kidding. Budget cuts. They've made a lot of budget cuts and now it's just me. People don't value the parks and then they get what they get. Bob, this guy's freakin' me out. Shh. It's fun. It's ranger humor. Uh, so, we're gonna drive now, so, thanks for everything. (chuckling): Camp at your own risk. State park motto. Sir, I need you to lift the gate. Yeah, right, the gate. Sure. Yeah, you just sort of left. Open. Open sesame. There you go. Thank you. Gene: (gasps) Nature boner! Mm, boing! That's not what it is, Gene. Come on. It's a rock. It's a wang. Mount Wang. William Archibald Wang, a Chinese diplomat, was the first to summit that mountain. William Wang, what can't you do? Where's he now? Back in the city, staying at a hotel like a normal person. (bees buzzing) Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Ooh! What are those? Bees? Oh, I hate 'em. Great identification, Mom. Thank you, Tina. Wait, Bob, this is all you packed? Well, I mean, I packed this, my Nature Master, and I got two tents and this cool camping stove I borrowed from Teddy. What about food? And water? And what about toiletries? (chuckles) Well, there's a river right there. That's all the water you could ever drink, you know? So we'll be fine for one day. Oh. And the river's also nature's grocery store. That's where we get all our food, like fish and vegetables. Vegetables?! Yes. From upriver. Mac and cheese? And we'll make our own cheese. We can do that in the woods. But how? I-I-I... Because you ferment the milk from... I... Look, people, everything we need is right here. Or over there. There's no line for that food truck. You know what? Fine. I'm going to go catch me a meal. In that river. With this. We're gonna catch all the fish. God, I love you. Hi. I'm sorry to bother you. We're camping over there, and my husband blew it on packing. Can I borrow some crackers or, you know, peanut butter? You guys, you look so prepared. You've got to be prepared when civilization breaks down. Oh. Wait, why will civilization break down? Have you been to the post office lately? She knows. That's right I know. What does she know? You know. I know you know I know. What happens at the post office? They seem organized. He doesn't know. He doesn't know anything. What? Perhaps you might be interested in reading more about it in our literature. Oh! Okay. Huh. Woman: Please... borrow whatever you need. Ooh. That plus that plus that. Oh, uh... Wow. I-I need my juice. Okay. Well, enjoy our provisions while you digest our truths. Thank you so much. Um, can I borrow some wine, too? Wine helps me drink. (chuckles) Come on, kids, let's go. Mmm, mmm! Those kooks make some good chili. Bobby, you sure you don't want any chili? (scoffs) No. I will be enjoying the fish I caught. That's a fish? Yeah, Gene. It's a trout. It's king of the river. I can cut it up if anyone wants to share. You know, I'm not gonna... be able to eat all this. Dad, are you sure you cooked it enough? Tina, the worst thing you can do is overcook a trout. I wish I could cook it less. Enjoy your goldfish, wild man. (gags, coughing) That's a lot of bones. But with trout, when you're as experienced as I am... (coughs) you learn to use your mouth to take the bones out. Use the back of your... (coughs) throat. Wow. They're asleep. Must be the woodsy air. Yeah. Crazy how kids can fall asleep sober like that. Mm. Hey, I read that there's a warm spring around here. Some people skinny-dip there. You want to, uh, go find it? A warm spring? Don't you mean a hot spring? Well, it said warm spring. What about the kids? They're fine. We'll be close. Okay, but if a deer sees me naked, you can't get jealous. What about the vest? Oh, no, this guy stays on. Oh, that's nice. Ah. Come on in. Whoo! Uh... (burps) 'Scuse me. Oh, that's really trouty. This is lukewarm at best. They should call it a tepid spring. Really? 'Cause I'm, uh... Wow. I'm boiling in here. (groans) Oh, boy. I'm gonna, uh... I'm just gonna use the restroom. I mean, a tree. I mean, I got to get out of here. Hey, where you going? Come back to Mommy. No, not right now. Don't... Let go, Lin. Let's make this crappy little warm spring hot. Let go. Let go. I got to go to the bathroom. Come to Mommy. Come on. Give me your hand. Let go. Please, Lin. Definitely an emergency. Come to Mommy. Let go! Oh! Oh! Whoa, whoa. Oh! Oh! (both shouting) (both shouting) Gene: What was that? The loud sound? Yeah. Probably an owl? Should one of us go check it out? Not me? Guys, come on, listen, it's nature. We're not all gonna make it tonight. Safe, safe, goner. Good night. (groans) (whimpers) Linda?! Bob! Grab that branch! Aah! (grunts) Aah! (grunting) (gargling) (gasps) This river is really fast! Fastest I've ever seen! You see lots of fast rivers, Bob? No! I'm just saying that this is really fast, okay? Linda: Oh, what do you know? Bob: You're gonna argue with me now?! Linda: Yes, now! When we're flying 30 miles an hour down a river?! Bob: (grunts) We made it. (Linda panting) What the hell was that river's problem? You stupid river! I'm gonna sit down. Nope! I'm gonna go over there for a sec. Bob? (strained): Oh, boy. Lin, look over there. It's a pelican. And Patrick Duffy. Patrick Duffy?! Where? I love Dallas. Oh, he ran away. Where'd you go? I, uh, got a-a walking stick. That's why I went behind that bush. I didn't have diarrhea at all. I love it out here. Oh, God. There's got to be a better stick back there. I'll go find it. Oh! Where are you, Bob? Bob? There's the better stick right there. I found it. Hey, Lin. Oh. (groans) How do you l-like my new walking stick? That old one was so stupid compared to this one. This is the one I wanted. (sniffing) Why does this vest smell like puke and fish? That's the smell of a man. A healthy camping man. (groans) Camping's gross. And we're friggin' lost. You might be lost, but I'm not lost. I know the woods. All we have to do is just follow the river back to camp. You sure about that, Mr. Outdoors? Yeah. We'll be in our tent before the kids even wake up. Good. We got to get to the kids before wolves raise 'em. It's my worst fear. Little Wolf Gene. I'd have to cut holes in all the seats of his pants. (chuckles) Why? For the tail. Why would we even dress him? He's a wolf. Because he'd still need to go to school and be loved by the other kids. But he'd be a... he wouldn't want to wear clothes. It doesn't... Just because he's different, Bob. Do you know how much money we would save, Lin? (birds chirping) (yawns) I'm gonna put a breakfast order in at the RV. You guysant anything? Where are Mom and Dad? They're not in there? Maybe they went for a morning hike. (laughs) No. Look. It's their clothes. Oh, no! Mom and Dad melted! Things got a little physical. Signs of a struggle. Clothes went off. When these rocks gave way and then whoosh. Oh, my God. Mom and Dad could be nude dangling over the edge of a cliff. According to the Thundergirl handbook, we should... wait here for a person of authority to arrive. Can I see that page? Sure. Thank you. (grunts) We should tube down the river and find Mom and Dad. We should really tube. Let's tube! Yes, let's tube! Why are we talking when we should be tubing? Isn't this stealing? Nuh-uh, it's borrowing. 'Cause Thundergirls don't steal. Well, uh, we're borrowing. Borrow everything that isn't nailed down! You're staying with me until I put you on Dad myself! Wait, let's tie our tubes together so we don't get separated. Yeah, let's get our tubes tied! Okay, let's whoosh. All: Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! (whoops) Yeah! (Bob grunts) Hey, look, it's Mount Wang! Why does it look so small? Oh, crap. We followed the wrong river! How did we do that? This feeds into that, and we followed this all night. Oh... Oh, my God. I feel sick. (groans) Okay, okay. This is just like when we forgot where we parked at the baseball game. We'll do what we did then. We walked back to the entrance of the stadium and then we retraced our steps. We got to go down to this river again and we come up the right river to the campsite. That's a dumb plan. It will take too long. Well, what do we do?! The kids must be worried sick about us. We need to go straight across. Are you sure, Bobby? Yes, I'm sure. The right way is... that way? That might not have sounded like I'm sure but I'm sure. All right; You're the Nature Master. We're coming for you, kids! Tina: We're coming for you Mom and Dad! (whooping, shouting)    Oh, I'm so hungry, Bobby. Oh, my God, I ate an ant. Oh, I just ate another one. Mmm, mmm. Mmm, mmm. Lin, what are you doing? Oh, they're not bad. Oh, look, a worm! Oh, don't eat... Don't eat that... (gags) No... Oh! Huh! Right there. Come here, you little sucker. Come on! Don't eat a worm in front of me. (gags) Please, I don't want to see you eat a worm. Oh. Mmm. Come on. Try one, Bob. (groans) Get that way from me. Just a taste. Just a taste. Get it away. Oh, why did we go camping?! Huh. There's nothing in here about finding lost parents. Did you know there are eight different ways to hold hands? Tina! Stop reading that stupid Thundergirl book! I have something from the RV I can read from. "Apocatips for the Apocalypse." "Don't wait for nightfall to build shelter." That makes sense. "Leave no trace. Shave off your fingerprints." Been saying that for years. My feet don't work anymore. Carry me. Oh, come on. We got to get to the kids before it gets dark. Right, the kids. Second wind! Didn't work. Okay, I guess we're stopping. I'm just gonna lay down for a sec, recharge my battery, all right? Oh, my God. We're gonna spend another night in the woods? Okay. We need a fire. We got to make a fire. Just, um... put some wood on your face. Bob, you're not making sense. Don't say fish! Oh, Bobby! Help! Can anyone hear me?! Patrick Duffy! "Now that your shelter is built, you must seal the perimeter. Remember the 30 sticks you've sharpened to a deadly point?" Yeah. "They will now be utilized." Oh, I thought they were for some kind of skit. Thundergirls do skits around the campfire. What skit would that possibly be for? I don't know. You should see some of the skits that get produced. Look at this part. They say insects can and should be weaponized. "Beware of any organization that rewards members with empty titles or trinkets. These are the wool of the sheep." Hey, Tina, you're looking a little sheepish yourself right now. My Thundergirl patches aren't trinkets. Though I did get this patch for making trinkets. We wouldn't be here if it weren't for your stupid make-up trip. And we've learned more useful stuff in two hours from this baby than you've ever learned from those brainwashing Thundergirls. I'm not brainwashed. Do you chant or repeat mantras? No. All: I'm a Thundergirl. I'm a Thundergirl. I'm a Thundergirl. Oh. Yes. (shushing) Shut up. Shut up! Look over there. We're not alone, guys. It could be aggressive squirrels worshipping fire. It could be Mom and Dad. Either way, grab a spear. We're going in. Troop: Rain, rain! Flash, flash! Thundergirls wear a thunder (grunt) sash! Oh, my God. That sounds like Thundergirl troop number 39. They won the regional chant-off. Hello, who's over there? Louise: We are! Yeah, we are! Hey, you're a Thundergirl. (chuckling): Yeah, she was. Until shlearned that organizations like this are soul stealers! I-I, I don't understand. Did-did you get sep... (mocking): "Oh, I-I don't understand." (stutters) Can I... (mocking gasps) Just... Did you get separated from your troop? No. My troop got... separated from... reality. Thundergirls are a sham! Yeah! Lay it on 'em, Teen! I used to be like you. This morning. I only cared about sashes and patches. Sashes and patches! Then I woke up. She woke the hell up! Okay. Maybe you kids should camp with us tonight. We have plenty of food... I'd rather die! We don't need your food! Or your lies. Unless you have some cookies! And not the oatmeal ones! Never the oatmeal ones! Yeah! Even if they have chocolate chips in them, they're still oatmeal! The truth is, y-you're all just cogs in a cookie-sellining machine! Right. You're a cog, you're a cog, you're definitely a cog. You're more of a pawn. What? Honey, I think you're tired. And you're kind of dirty. I've never been more awake and dirty in my life. I hereby renounce my Tenderheart-level membership to the Thundergirls! (troop gasps) Louise: Yeah! We're out of here! Yeah, and we're taking these. And this one. Good luck with your skit. Thanks. (birds chirping) (Bob groans) Oh, you're hogging all the blankets. Come on. Get up. Come on. Hmm? I'm leading us. Let's go. What are you talking about? Ow. Ow. You're sick! I'm not sick. Then what the hell is that? Wh-What? I'll tell you what that is: It's diarrhea and throw-up. You're firing from both ends. I studied the ballistics. It checks out. That was probably a bobcat. Oh, okay. You didn't eat a raw trout that didn't make you poop and barf your way through the forest like some kind of disgusting Hansel and Gretel. I'm taking charge here! We're gonna go! Come on! This way now! No. Not that way. It's this way. You don't even know what you're doing out here, Lin. I don't know what I'm doing? I fed myself ants and grubs and I made a wilderness hairbrush. Doesn't work, but still. Plus, you're sick, so let's go. I'm Nature Master now. You're never Nature Master! I'm Nature Master! I'll go back to camp this way and then we'll send help for you! Oh, come on. Just stick with me. You've got horrible diarrhea, Bob. You've got horrible diarrhea, Bob! (yawns) Day one without the sash. Whew. Got to figure out who I am and what I'm going to wear diagonally across my chest. Seatbelt? Bandolier? Oh, yeah. And tonight, we take off your fingerprints. All right, people, let's move out! Got to find the kids. Got to beat Linda. Need strength. Got to find food. Kids! Kids! Mommy's coming! Whew! I'm headed for the Wang! I can see the tip! (exhaling sharply) Oh, Bobby, why do you gotta be such a wang! Is that... is that a nut? What are you, an acorn? If you're poisonous, tell me now. (squirrel squeaks) Hey! Get back here with my nut, you jerk. (panting) (chittering) Well, well, well. It looks like the squirrel has become the idiot. Thanks for doing the heavy lifting, squirrels. Oh, boy. Get away from me! Get away from me! Aah! Aah! Don't eat me! I don't have the strength to fight. This is how I'm gonna die. (squirrels chittering) This is taking forever. Hurry up and eat me. (Linda yelling) Linda?! That's my man! You get your paws off those nuts! Hi-ya! Ah-wa! Ya! Ah-whoo! You saved me! Yeah, I missed your stinky face. Hoyou fein', my little salmonella fella? Uh... better. All empty. Sorry I-I left you back there. That was stupid. Oh, Bobby. Come on, let's go. Hey, Linda... there are two Nature Masters: The one I left at camp... I miss that one so bad... but the other Nature Master is you. Aw. This is a fishing pole, this is a toothpick... what the hell is this? You got to get that removed. What? That's, like, a huge wart. Don't look at that. Stop it. Come on, we got to get back to camp. Bob (sighs): Holy crap. We're here. Kids! Bobby, the kids are gone! What? What? Woman: They're in here! Yeah, hurry. We got fudge in here, too. Fudge. Bob: Kids? Gene. Tina. Louise. Where are you, babies? Where-where are you? Your kids aren't here. And neither is the fudge. Bob and Linda: What?! Your kids stole the fudge. Along with our inner tubes and our travel backgammon set. And a copy of our survivalist guide. Um, okay. I'm sorry about that, but where are they? We need to find them. We've been in the woods for, like, 40 hours. Well, we've been in the woods for 40 months. And we think you've got what it takes to join us. What do you say, Linda? Did our literature speak to you? What?! Who cares about any of that crud? We need to find our kids! Forget your kids. They're floating in very high quality inner tubes down a river eating fudge and playing backgammon. Um, all right, well, we're gonna go to them now, okay? Hold-hold on; Hold up. Ooh, is this bear mace? Why are you holding bear mace in my face? (door locks) We need to know that you are ready to accept our invitation. Okay... Let's put on our "Ritual of Trust" music. I'll get the trust lotion. They're not here. Now what? Let's get a tiny bit more fudge. Or a lot bit more fudge.  Everybody dance now  (mellow Latin jazz playing) (quietly): What the hell is going on? What do we do? Shh. I've got an idea how to get us out of here. Just follow my lead. Okay! Here we go! Let's lotion up. Yeah! Great! You're the first ever to agree to the Ritual of Trust. This is gonna be so icy hot. Oh, it sure is, hon. Very s*xual. Whew! Yes. I am looking forward to it. Can I just use your tiny restroom to freshen up? Trust me, you don't want any of this like this. Nah. Ew. (sniffs) Yeah, we smell like ass. Come on, Bobby.  Ooh, yeah, you tell me...  (grunts) It's too small. Tina: Mom? Oh, my babies. Bob: Is that the kids? What are you guys doing? Bob: Uh, trying to escape. But not successfully. Go get help. Your father and I are being held hostage by the horny hermits. (bee buzzing) Hmm, I think I've got a plan. A plan bee. All right, Tina. This is all you. Just like unscrewing a lightbulb. Maybe this will help you. My sash! You knew I was always a Thundergirl deep down and would want it back. No! This is satin, woman. You don't just throw away satin! Maybe Thundergirls aren't completely useless in the wild. Maybe a bit of Thundergirl resourcefulness and a little bit of survivalist weaponized insects make for a perfect s'more of ideas. Turns out I'm a Thunder-vivalist. Tina, shush! Just do it! Oh, yeah, sorry. (grunting): Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh!  Thundergirl in the hole! Ow! Ooh! Ooh! Bees! Ooh! Whoa! (shouts) They've weaponized insects! They took a page out of our own book. Page 17. Bob: Ow! I'm getting stung! That was your plan?! You're welcome. I'll Mace them! (screams) Oops. (groaning) Camping is fun! Go, go. In the car! Bobby, your stuff. Forget the stuff! (quietly): Gene, grab my Nature Master. Mm-hmm! Mm, mm, mm! You can't Mace a guy! (coughs) Oh, well, you know what else you can't do? You can't take your wife camping for 40 months! (coughs) You're right, honey. Come here. Come over here. (screams) Yeah. Here, Tina. It's a patch for keeping Mom and Dad alive. I don't think this'll count as an official patch but thank you. You did the Thundergirls proud, honey. And I never left them ever. And no one can say I did. Dad, your underpants. Thank you. Perfect underwear, perfect weekend. Uh, this isn't my underwear. Gene: More underwear for me then. Girls (to hip-hop beat):  Rain! Rain! Flash! Flash!  Thundergirls wear a Thunder (grunt) girl sash!  Honor, friendship, trust, integrity  Ant Raid, sunscreen, skits and jelly beans  Thundergirls are bound to sing this  Song of nature, friends and things  (hip-hop beat continues)  I'll be a Thundergirl till I'm six feet under, girl, uh!  That's right, I'll be, I'll be a Th... 
(school bell rings) (indistinct chatter) Whoa, whoa, whoa! Why aren't you guys in costume? No one's gonna give you candy without a costume. Oh, is that how trick or treating works, Darryl? Yes. How do we get the candy? You put on a costume. Okay. And you go door to door. Oh, no... we put on a costume! Relax! We've got the costume of costumes. No need for the attitude, Louise. I just don't want you to not have candy. I know, Darryl. Concern's coming from a good place. We're going as a Chinese Dragon. They'll be five of us inside. (quieter): But we'll say there's ten of us. It's a trick to get more treats. We'll be swimming in nougat. I remember when I thought group costumes were a good idea. Too much work! And not enough friends. I'll admit, it's ambitious, but we have our best people on it. (sighs) Why do we even have to do this? Come on, is it so hard to glue things? And run a restaurant? Yeah, it is. Well, this is what parents do. They glue crap on stuff for their kids... so glue! I'm gluing. We got a lot of stuff. Glue, glue, glue! I said... Glue! Please don't chant glue. And glue and glue and glue! I think I'm too old to trick-or-treat. Next year I'm going cold turkey. When you go from tween to teen, you say good-bye to Halloween. You're never too old for trick-or-treating. Or holding hands with dad. Girl: When I say "Lou," you say "Eez." Lou! Oh, God. When I say Lou, you say Eez! Where is she? Lou... Who's that? (sighs) It's Millie Frock. She wants to be my friend or be me or be a rap duo with me. That's nice. No, it's not nice, Tina! It's not nice at all. Lou... Eez! Aah! No! Oh, hi, Louise. Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle. Stop it! What are you dressed as? Remember? Remember our plan? You don't remember our plan? You be dust, I'll be bunny. Dust bunny! (hysterical laughter) That is not our plan, Millie. We didn't have a plan. And even if we did, even if we did get together and sit down, get some blueprints out, have a cup of coffee, why would I want to be dust? Dust! So you could be bunny? Why? That's exactly what dust would say. Good-bye. Teddy: Can't help but notice you're not playing the Halloween Scream CD I gave you. Uh, you know, I didn't want to wear it out before the kids started coming around. Where is it? You have to... Oh! It's right there! Behind you! Oh, great. Well, it can't play itself, Bob. You got to put it on and hit "play." Bobby, come on. Play the sounds of the holiday. Well, we don't need to right now, Teddy. Why not? We'll wait till the kids come. Why? (sighs) Fine. I'll just put it in. (people screaming) (laughs) Ooh. I'm spooked. Now you're all set for trick or treaters in a couple of hours. Wait, what time is it? Oh, my God, Bobby, the kids'll be home any minute! And the costume's not even close to finished. What are we gonna do? I don't know. How about let them finish it? Mort, Teddy, wh-what are you doing right now? Adjusting myself without anyone noticing. Watching Mort adjust himself. Grab some glue. Gonna be our Halloween elves! Come on, you don't have to be good, you just have to be fast. Why can't all women want that? All right, we'll go home, finish the costume and hit the streets. Oh, I need to grab the dragon eyes from the fort. Why are they in the fort? I spray-painted them in there. (groans) Fine, we'll swing by the fort. Both: Yay! (chanting): Fort, fort, fort! Fort? Hmm. I didn't peg you guys as the forting type. Oh, we fort. We fort big-time. After you. Uh... I don't know. I got this thing about being in small spaces. Oh, you're gonna be fine, Darryl. Trust me. When you come out of here, you're gonna be afraid of this small space... that is the world. Millie: Hey Lou Lou, where are you you? Oh no, no, no, no, no! She's right here. I'm looking at her. Shut up! Quick, inside! (humming) Hey, are we gonna play in the fort before we go trick-or-treating? 'Cause, uh... Louise, you, you shut the door before I could even get in. Oh, sorry, Millie, we're at capacity, so... (laughing) You always say that. Now, come on, let me in! Yeah, ah, god, I sure wish I could but it's kind of a one-in, one-out situation. The fire marshal's on our ass. You understand, Millie. Well, I'll wait. Or-or you could come back later, too. We'll be here a while. It'll thin out in a bit. I'll get some more dust for our costumes! Dust bunny, think about it. Seriously, think about it. Okay, yeah. I'm knocking it around in my head right now. I think it's gonna be awesome! All right, Millie. It's gonna be great! Bye, babe.  La, la, la, la.  Whew, that was close. Hurry up and get the dragon eyes before crazy comes back. This fort is amazing. I only feel a little claustrophobic. This would be a great place to go when my mom tells me to go play outside. All right, come on. We'll give you the quickie tour. This is Gene's room. There's some odor. Yes. Found them! And now the upstairs. There's an upstairs? Oh, yeah. This is Tina's room. You can really feel the insecurity. Hmm. Mm. I think it's nice. You don't think it's nice? No, no, it's nice. It's nice. VoilÃ . Parlor de la Louise. (whistles) Lovely view. The light's bad for the upholstery. True, fading... it is an issue. Yeah. So, what house will be the first stop on Tina's farewell trick-or-treating tour? Leave that to me. This town might suck at Halloween, but not if you have this. I give you... the Treasure Trail. All: Whoa! Eugene: Wow! It took phone-polling, mailing-lists, and a blog I follow called Candy Randy. So houses with stars are? Those are must-visits. And houses with an X? Must-avoids. I'm talking raisins, pencils, hand sanitizer, baby apples. Sayonara, raisins. Old grapes aren't candy! (kids cheering) (beeping outside) Do you guys hear that? What the...? (grunting) Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey! (kids scream) Kids, kids inside! Precious kids! Yeah, Dino, I'm coming. I'm coming. I just parked. Yeah. (all gasp) I can leave it in the alley all night, no one ever comes back here. Yeah, I'm in costume. They were all out of Draculas so I'm a fruit head or something. Did he just say he's parking here all night? That's what he said! Oh, my God. We're trapped. Help! (kids screaming) (kids screaming blends with Halloween Scream CD playing) (kids grunting) Weak spots... find the weak spots! We can't be totally boxed in here. (grunts) Concrete. (grunts) Metal. (both grunting) Concrete! And truck. We're screwed. Until that truck moves. Which it's not until tomorrow! Oh, man, I'm starting to freak out here. Millie: Hello? It's later! Oh, Millie. Millie, Millie, Millie, Millie, Millie. Louise, you in there? I am! Millie, you have to get us out of here. Go for help! The truck pinned us in. Someone needs to move it! What? (gasps) Oh, yeah. Get the fire department! And the police! Just get everybody! Oh, sure! Hey, Louise. Hey, I was thinking, let's get bunk beds and live in the forest. Um... (chuckling): wow. Or matching Murphy beds that fold up into trees! Gene: Millie, this is Gene! Hey, could you go for help? Oh yeah, I'm going to. Hey, when I say Lou, you say Eez. Lou! Eez. Okay. That was fun. You can go now. Lou! Eez. Okay, that is enough of that. Lou. Eez. That's plenty. Lou... Eez, Eez, Eez! Go get some help, you frickin' nutcase! You creepy stalker psycho kook! Can you not understand a hint? Go... get... help! Oh, wow. I see. I see you don't like me, huh? Of course I don't! Who would? Who would?! (shushes) What are you doing? Don't listen to her. This is Gene again. We think you're terrific. Did you do something with your hair? You look great. You seem real strong. You been working out? Louise, can you tell me this? If dust hits the ground and no one's around to hear it, does it make a sound? I don't know, Millie. No, it doesn't. So, I guess what I'm saying is have fun spending Halloween in a box. (laughs) Good one, Millie. (maniacal laughter) Silly Millie. (maniacal laughter) That was good. How's it coming, Teddy? Great, Lin! (sings fanfare) All done. Teddy, is that it? Yeah, it's a dragon spike. For the back. Yeah, I know, Teddy. You're supposed to have 20 done by now! Oh. Bobby, how's that foot coming? Foot? I'm working on the tail. I'm doing the tail! You're supposed to do the foot! No, you said, "Bob, do the tail." I know because I remember thinking, "You can't tail me what to do." Teddy? That's funny. (sighs) No, it's not! And I'm doing the tail! My tail's better than yours! Ah... (grumbles) Yours is really good. Yeah, I know it is. All right, fine! I'll do the foot. Pass me the sequins. I would, but we're all out because someone that's my wife has no concept of how many sequins she's using! Are you talking about me? God, yes. Just go get some more! Fine! Great! This might not be a great time, but I also made a tail. (Darryl yelling) We can not miss Halloween! This is all your fault, Louise! You were mean to Millie and now we're stranded! Yeah! She seems... really cool. Okay, I'm hearing a lot of blame being thrown around loosey goosey right now. Millie (sing-songy):  Somebody's in friend jail  Somebody's in friend jail  And friend jail lasts forever.    Hey, Millie. Oh, don't mind me. I'm just collecting spiders for an experiment. Cool, I collect porcelain horses. I experiment with where I put them on my dresser. Well, this experiment is called "see how much you freak out when I release spiders into the fort you're trapped in." (all screaming) (grunting) Seal it up, Gene! Seal it! (groans) I have a thing about spiders! You have a thing about everything! But especially spiders. They're scary. (yelling) Andy's still in there! Let him out! We can't! Then we'd all get spidered! I'll never forget you, Andy. I'll be with you every time you look in the mirror. What? 'Cause we look alike. Never mind! Oh! No, I get it now! I didn't want those to be my last words! (gasps) (cries): Why?! Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What the...? Hold on. Andy, get up. They're fake spiders. (cheers) (sighs) I thought I was a goner. I felt you die. (Millie laughing) Oh, my God. We're closed. What? No, no, no. I'm-I'm making a dragon. For my kids. We're-we're halfway through, We just need another bag to finish. When you wait until the last minute to buy art supplies, you pay the price! Harold! (groans) You heard her, Bob Fosse. We're closed. Bob Fosse? Look, I just need one bag. That's it. Oh! Bob Fosse doesn't need more than one bag. Oh! I'm not Bob Fosse! I'm making a costume for my... Ooh. Ooh. I'm just taking these. Here's money. No, no! Ooh, Mr. Bob Fosse... just running away! (yells) Oh, no! (tires screech) Stop! (car horns honking) Yes, I hear you honking! I'm just trying to make a costume for my kids! It's a dragon! Andy and Ollie: Trick or treat! Oh, and what are you dressed as? We switched shirts. I'm Ollie. I'm Andy. Here's a rusted nine volt battery for you. Ooh. And a used coffee filter for you. Thanks. Happy Halloween. Want to trade? Yeah. This is a mockery! But I will take a coffee filter. Thanks. This isn't how I wanted to spend my last Halloween, Louise. I'm handing out batteries in a box full of Gene's farts. It's not fulyet! Uh-oh. (kids yell) Ow! (groans) Why is my butt wet? Butts get wet, Tina. It's what they do. Or maybe it's from that. (sniffs) Hmm. Must be garbage juice from the Dumpster next door. I'm getting pinto beans, some sandpaper... Guys, we just found our way out. Gene, is she out there? What do you hear? Nothing. Except for Tina's breathing. (heavy breathing) You picking that up? Loud and loud. Louise: All right, Andy, Ollie. You two and me are the only ones small enough to fit through that hole in the Dumpster. I would go, but I'm master-minding this. So one of you two should go. Which one of you was born first? I was. I came in second. All right then, Ollie, squeeze into the dumpster, burrow through the trash, jump out and run for help. Just like when you came out of your mom. Got it? What did she mean by "Came out of our mom?" Okay, Ollie, get in there. Go, go, go, go. (grunts) We just got to get out of here, man. Whatever it takes. Getting so cramped in here. Okay, you really don't need to take your pants off. I wish you were right. (grunting) Oh, hi. Hi. Ow! How could Millie have possibly known about our plan? We whispered the whole time! Well, there's only one explanation, isn't there? One of you, in this room... in this sacred fort... is a rat! (all gasping) Millie: Oh, yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah. One of you is. Can you just tell me who it is? No. Millie! Louise: So, which one of you is the rat? Tina, this is your last Halloween ever. You ratted us out to Millie so we'd never have to leave, didn't you? What? I-I want to get out more than anyone. My childhood is slipping through my candy-less fingers. Maybe Gene's the rat. Oh, please, let's just calm down and take a spray paint nap. Darryl, why are you wearing your backpack? Um... Why are you wearing your backpack, Darryl? Answer the question. I just want to make sure I don't lose it. Oh, really? You don't want to lose it? Because you think you're getting out of here? I am! Millie, let me out of here! I did my part, you do yours! She's not letting you out, Darryl. You fool! Why would you do this? (Millie laughing) (sobbing): I'm weak, Louise. I'm weak. "Dear Millie, I need candy. "Also I will need to poo soon. Please let me out." Millie: "Dear Darryl, "Help me help you poo. "Be my man on the inside. Love, Millie." (blows raspberry) I couldn't let the Treasure Trail go to waste! If you hadn't told her about our escape plan, we could have used our plan to escape! Oh, that's so obvious now, isn't it? I'm sorry it's hard for me to think when my pants are off. (sobbing): I just want candy! All right, all right. It's okay, Darryl. You didn't know what you were doing. Huh, buddy? No. My pants are off. Yeah. So, what do we do with a snitch? You did the crime, now you do the time. Andy and Ollie... Burp 'n Blow. (both burping and blowing) Poor b*st*rd. (sniffs) That smells nice. You guys eat sherbet? Cucumber soap. I ate a flower. This is the one day you don't eat peanut butter and tuna for lunch? You ruined Burp n' Blow torture! Bob: It's pretty bad. It's not. It's fun. It's festive. No. It looks like it's from China. No, China would be furious about this dragon. They love dragons there. Hey, where are the kids? They should've been home by now. Oh, my God, they're lost! Not on Halloween! Lin, easy. They're dead. No, they're not dead. They're dead. No, I know it, they're dead. No, I bet they're in that fort they built. 21Oh, yeah. Ugh, that fort. Well, it is pretty cool once you get inside. What do you mean inside? They let you in? I thought we weren't allowed. I wasn't supposed to say anything. But it's great. Why can't I go in? I-I don't know, I... And there's a ton of rules they have, so... I guess... that was one of them. Right, right, right, whatever. We're gonna go to that fort and we're getting those little should-be trick-or-treaters and we're shoving them inside this thing. Hey, you guys, I was just trick-or-treating! Mmm, this candy's so good. Oops, I dropped some. Good thing there's more where that came from. You monster! You can't do this to us! Bob: Uh, it's just down here. Linda: Yeah, I know where it is, Mr. I've Been in The Fort Before And You Haven't. That's right, I have. They were inside my fort for a long time. That's the original fort. Bob and Linda. Uh...? Huh. Millie Frock. Louise's friend? Hey, you know, I just ran into Louise and Gene and Tina trick-or-treating. What? They're trick-or-treating without their costume? We've been slaving away all day! Where? Where are they? I don't know the name of the street, 'cause I'm a little kid. But if you follow me, I can show you. Skip like this. (hums a tune) I don't want to skip. I said skip! Who is this kid? I like her. She's fun. So last year was my last Halloween and I didn't even know it. I wish I could go back in time and tell myself to enjoy it more. And also, not to go into this fort. I wish I could go back ten seconds ago before I ate cardboard. Uh-oh, I'm doing it again. Hmm. Wait. Guys, take a look at this. What is it, rat? Darryl: You see those buttons on the truck? Yeah. We just have to find a way to hit the "up" button and boom, the roof is lifted. And how exactly are we going to hit the button, huh? You gonna snitch on it? No, we use this. Darryl,, you're my favorite kind of rat. A rat with a hanger. Linda: Where'd she go? Whew, she's a fast skipper. So where are the kids? I don't see them anywhere. I'll tell you where they are. Not wearing their costume on Ungrateful Avenue. Jerks. We worked so hard on this thing. I fought the people at the art supply store. All that glue in my hair. I hate to see it go to waste. Yeah. (doorbell rings) Bob and Linda: Trick or treat! Oh, uh... what are you supposed to be? Bob: (kid's voice): It's a dragon, duh. It doesn't look like any dragon I've ever seen before. Yeah, well, your doo's spid. Yeah. Yeah. Aren't you a little bit old to be trick or treating? You're old. You're probably 60. I am 60... Hey! We gonna get any candy or not? No! You have to give it. Bob? No. Is that you? No. What? Who's...? Bob. From the burger place. No. No way. I'm not... I'd recognize you anywhere. I'm nine. That is hilarious. It's still not me. (normal voice): It's not me. That is hilarious. Honey, come. It's Bob. From the burger place. I can't... We can't stay. Just stay-stay there Stay there. Stay there. I can't. We actually have to go. It's great. It's great. It's Bob and Linda. Bob, could you...? That's not... From the burger place. Nah. Honey, they're pulling some sort of... I don't know it's a prank or... Dave, I can't stay, I'm sorry. Ah, hi... But good to see you. Steady... steady... Gene: I can't watch. Mostly because I can't see. (motor running) You hear that? It's working! (kids cheering) (thud) Uh... (kids yelling) You hit the wrong button! Turn it off! Turn it off! I can't! The hanger's stuck! (grunting) Aah! (kids yelling) We're all gonna die! Every meal I've ever eaten is flashing before my eyes! Oh, my god, my last meal was cardboard. (both yelling) (kids yelling) This is not good for my claustrophobia! Wait, there's garbage. We could use it, we could stack it. Yes! Stack the strong stuff. Maybe we can stop this thing from crushing us. Ollie, Andy, get in there! (both grunting) It's working! Isn't it? (Louise yells) (kids yelling) Yes! The door! It's open! Crawl to freedom! Crawl to Halloween! Crawl to candy! (groans) My shoe! Now our shoes will be together! All: Whoa! We did it! We're alive! Whew, we've still got a few minutes left on the candy clock. What about our costume? Screw the costume. There's no time! We only got a few minutes left on the candy clock! Did you not hear me? But nobody will give us candy if we're not wearing one. (groans) Congratulations. You're a robot. Hold on, candy! I'm coming for you! Yeah! (kids grunting) Darryl: Treasure Trail... lead us to treasure. (kids groaning) Oh, come on! No! No! Turn them on! Turn them on! We're still here! Don't you go off on me! Aha! There you are. You think you're too good for your costume? For us? Costume? What am I even looking at? Godzilla's ding-dong? It's a dragon, Gene. It's not a dragon. Yes, it is. You asked to us to make you a dragon, we did. Wh-what are you? Bean can head? Yeah. No. Robot bean can head to you. Oh. Well, I bet we got more candy than you did, so neh. Wait, where is your candy? Long story. Actually, I could tell it pretty fast. Well, at least we can have some of yours. Nah-uh, bean heads. We get the candy. Yum, yum, yum, yum. No, we get the candy! It's ours! We're eating it all right now. Never! I want your candy! No! Get them! Get out of our dragon! I thought I was done with Halloween. But it turns out, Halloween's not done with me. Aah! Get out of our dragon! Okay, Halloween's over. I'm gonna eat more candy in front of you guys. But you can eat the mini boxes of raisins I didn't want. You'll need your strength to make it through the ni... Oh, my God, I k*lled them! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! People are gonna be so mad at me. I'm gonna have to find a therapist. Oh, geez, I hope I like my therapist. Louise: You definitely won't. (gasps) Who said that? Gene: The ghosts of us! This is Gene's ghost! Aah! Tina: We don't appreciate being k*lled! Boo. This is Tina's ghost. Oh, no. Oh, I didn't mean to k*ll you. I was just gonna keep you in there until you got old. Louise: Give us your candy, you nutcase. All of it? Or-or do you just want some of it? Or do you want to trade? All Three: All of it! (yelling) Here, take it! (grunts) Happy Halloween. Thanks for k*ll*ing us. Heaven's nice.
Why is that old couple holding hands in side-by-side bathtubs? (gasps) Is this an ad for side-by-side bathtubs?! I want them! Where have you been? It's 8:15. We have half the town out looking for you. Tina: How was date night? Great. It was all right. It was great. It was fine. It was really good. Yeah, it was fine. I'll take my doggie bag now. Breadsticks, breadsticks, breadsticks. Breadsticks! Well, I'm going to sleep. I'm exhausted from painting the town beige. What's that supposed to mean? I-I thought you liked Rudy's. Yeah, the first 15 times. Bobby, we almost never get to go out. Next time we should try something new. Look, we work hard, so on the rare occasion we take a little break, it's nice to know what we're getting. Whoa, Dad. Turn the romance down a notch, eh? Bob, I'm tired of us plopping down at Rudy's and eating soup, salad, breadsticks and fish. It's always soup and salad, breadsticks and fish. The type of soup changes. What was it tonight? Cream of something. Thank you, Tina. (groans) We need adventure or we're gonna shrivel up and die right in front of the kids. I call dibs on Mom and Dad's room! I call their clothes and jewelry! I call, uh, um, wait, what left? Dad's DVDs. Dibs! All the cards we've ever given Mom. Mine! This is all happening so fast. Put your seat-backs and tray tables up 'cause we're about to take off! Okay. (whoops) Seaplane flying lessons? What's a seaplane? I want to say it's a plane you can see, but that can't be right. I was at the market and I took this flyer out of a woman's shopping cart, and I signed you and me up for flying lessons. First lesson's free! Aren't you excited? Uh, no. I hate flying on big planes. Why would I want to go on a smaller, even less comfortable plane? Are you doing that thing where you're mean to seaplanes because you really like seaplanes? Pullin' on their hair. Let's just stick to good ol' Rudy's. No! No, no, no! No more boring dates! We need adventure, excitement! We're flying. Look at me... No, Lin. Come on, give me your hand. Come on! No, I don't... No. Lin, stop. I'm not going on a seaplane. Look out. Look out for the bird. Uh-oh, there's a balloon. How'd that get up here? I'm not in the air. Oh, look at the town from up here. I don't see anything. I'm on the ground. I see it. The people look like ants. No, wait, those are ants. And that's where Ma lives and Pa. I told you, I didn't go in the plane. I'm not with you. (groans) Fine! Then I'll go on our adventure by myself! You go to Rudy's and have a cannelloni all alone-y! Oh, my! She just rhyme-burned you. Put some lotion on that. Yoo-hoo. I'm here for the seaplane lesson. Are one of you fellas the flight teacher? Oh, not me, I'm old. But if you're looking for a father figure, look no further, young lady. Aw. No. Fair enough. Hi there. I'm Kurt. Nice to meet you. I'm Linda. This was supposed to be a couple's lesson but my husband's being a jerk. I-I mean, he didn't want to come. I-I mean, h-he couldn't come. Too bad. His loss. I'll go. Gus? Just kidding. I know I'm not allowed to go. Well, let me introduce you. Linda, this is Shoshana. Oh. She's a 1968 Sweetnam Eagle that I rebuilt by hand. She's 45 years old, but she looks 30 and she handles like she's 18. Oh, if I die today, I want that on my headstone. I love it. (engine starts) Go ahead and grab ahold of that yoke. Now, once that little needle reaches 60 knots... Linda (gasps): We're flying! No, you're flying. Oh! (laughs) (laughing): I'm flying! I am flying! You're a great teacher, Kurt. You're great for noticing. I am flying. Better than breadsticks! (whoops) Kurt: I haven't heard that one but okay... (bell tinkles) Uh, hi, Mr. Fischoeder. (quietly): Shh, shh, shh. Quiet, Bob. All right, see you in hell, Roger! What? This is the only spot I get good reception. Ooh, is someone taking flying lessons? Yeah, our mom. Poor Bob. I had no clue you and Linda were on the rocks. We're not. You're not not on the rocks. Ah, denial. A woman doesn't take flying lessons from Upskirt Kurt because she's satisfied in her marriage. Wait, what are you talking about? Who's Upskirt Kurt? Oh, yeah, I've heard of that guy. The macho seaplane pilot who beds bored housewives. What do you mean "beds"? He makes their beds? No, Gene. Kurt is seducing your mommy. Hmm... I hope he's a good listener because that bird likes to chirp. All right, knock it off. I-It's just a flying lesson. With Upskirt Kurt. Look, you know what's happening right now? She's cramped in a way too small space, nauseous from diesel fumes and this guy's B.O. You just described her life with you. Trust me, she is hating it. Whoa...! I wouldn't be too sure, Bob. See, uh, Kurt has a certain aphrodisiac he utilizes. Aphrodisiac? Yes, yes. First, he pretends there's a problem with the plane... (beeping) What's th... Wh-what's that sound? What-what's that sound? Are we okay? Huh, that's odd. We're losing altitude. Radio's dead. Wha-what? What's going on? What's happening?! We're okay, but we're going down. (screams) Then a fake emergency landing on an uninhabited island. Quippiquisset lsland, to be precise. But the locals call it "Quicky Kiss-it." Why do they call it that? It's a make-out island. Where people go to make-out. That's why I want to get a kayak. Quicky Kiss-it? Mm. Emergency landing? That cannot work. It could, Bob. Look at Castaway. Tom Hanks falls in love with a volleyball. It works. Kurt's a hero, and the bored wife is putty in his big, strong hands. Tina: Oh, I didn't know he had big, strong hands. Louise: Or putty. We're gonna die! I've never died before and I'm not about to start now. The bored wife cheats d*ath, then cheats on her husband. That's the power of adrenaline, kids. Oh, you should teach at my school. And you should work in my coal mine. Got to go. Sorry about your marriage! So, so sorry, Bob. Look, I really don't think a professional flight instructor is going around faking emergency landings, Teddy. Bah. You're probably right. (panting) Linda, look at me. Huh. We're gonna be okay. Huh. I'm gonna set her down nice and easy. Okay. Oh, God, the engine! (Linda screams) Linda: I don't want to die! I don't want to die! Just got to point the nose down into a controlled dive. Oh! We're gonna crash! No, we're gonna flare. Wait for the plane to settle onto the water. Just like a duck on a pond. O-kay. D-Duck, duck, duck, duck. Oh, duck, duck, duck, duck. Duck! Duck! Duck! Quackity, quackity! Quackity, quackity! Duckity duck! You did it! We're alive! Oh, Kurt, you saved us! I did. I really did. I guess between my training and my... (retches) instincts, uh... (retches) Okay. Oh, God. (retches) I've got mouthwash around here somewhere. (grunts) Gene: Upskirt Kurt... what a nickname. I mean, it rhymes, for one. Is Mom wearing a skirt? I can't remember. What did she wear today? Maybe he supplies the skirts on the plane. All right, knock it off. Your mom isn't being seduced right now. And I shouldn't have to say that to my kids. Well, you did get into a big fight with her earlier. And shouldn't she be back by now? She should... (sighs) Oh, God. All right, you know what? Let's go down and meet her at the docks. Not like I'm worried but just because I... We should see the docks. Ah, nothing like seeing a good dock, right, Dad? Mm-hmm. Uh, excuse me, sir. I'm looking for my wife. She's taking a flying lesson. She may or may not be wearing a skirt. Oh, my goodness, this is awkward. Uh, what? Wh-why? Nothing. So, flying lesson, huh? (chuckling nervously) Uh, yes, she's, uh... she's supposed to be back by now. Gosh. I-I just don't normally see the husband. Or the kids. Jeesh. Real life comes up and hits you in the face. Uh, okay, uh, all right. Uh, maybe we should go check out the island. You know, just to be safe. Uh, sir, how do we get to, um, uh... Quicky Kiss-it lsland. It's called Quippiquisset. And I have no idea. I guess the best way to get there is to crash a seaplane. What are you doing here, Bob? Shouldn't you be rescuing your bride? Uh, um, I'm trying to get out there. Someone's got to have a boat for hire around here. What do you think this is, Key West? Everybody's just got a boat? This guy thinks everywhere is Key West. Take the ferry to King's Head lsland. Maybe there you'll find this colorful, fictional boat-for-hire that you're looking for. Yeah, it's got to be colorful, right, Dad? Okay, yeah, the ferry. L-Let's do it. Ticktock, Bob. Upskirt Kurt moves faster than this. He's not called "Kurt the Long Slow Courtship Guy." She's not cheating on me! Okay... Well, what do we do now? The radio's dead. No one knows we're here. Can you fix the plane? Maybe. The engine's still too hot though. We'll have to wait it out. Man, I'm parched. Prosecco? Ooh, I love champagne. It's, uh, Prosecco. What? (burps) Oh, God. These bubbles make me burp. You always fly with champagne? Prosecco. I was gonna take my mother on a picnic after our lesson. She lives upstate. I love her dearly, and she loves picnics. Aw. But since we're stranded, we'll need the energy. Do you like cheese? I love cheese. Almost dying really makes you hungry. It does. But I promise you, I'll find us a way off of this rock. Got any mozz? Hey, let's get out of the sun so we don't dehydrate. There might be a shady meadow over that hill. And maybe go a little easy on the cheese. Mmm. Oh, it's good. Wow, you were right about the meadow. Hey, look, a lute! I always wanted to play one of these. The hell's a lute? (vocalizing) (high-pitched vocalizing) (vocalizing) If anything, I was sharp because you were flat. Or I was perfect. (horn blasting) Gene: So long, mainland! My island name will be Daiquiri Zachary. When you're not pouring drinks, you're solving mysteries. Quicky Kiss-it? Can there really be a whole island for kissing? Ah...  Quicky Kiss-it  Quicky Kiss-it  Quicky Kiss-it  Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah  Quicky Kiss-it  Ooh, Quicky Kiss-it  La, la, la, la, la, la, la.    Whoa. Dad, what's gonna happen when you see Upskirt Kurt? Are you gonna punch him? (sighs) I'm not punching anyone, Louise. Dad's not a fighter, he's a yeller. An old yeller. Normally I'd agree, but we're talking about Dad's woman. I think it gets physical. I'm sure nothing is happening on that island. Mr. Fischoeder! No! Why didn't you say you had a boat?! I have a boat! There. Are you happy? No! Bye! Uh, excuse me, can you, uh, take us to Quippiquisset lsland? AKA Quicky Kiss-it lsland. Where the currency is kisses and everyone is rich. That's my daughter. Well, I can take you as far as here. That's my mail route. Uh, great. That'd be great. No one lives on Quippiquisset, so no one sends mail there. Just neckers and canoodlers on Quippiquisset. Hmm. Um, okay. And gropers. Huh. Got it. We'll, uh... we'll take the ride right away. Something about Quippiquisset just makes people horny as hell. Hmm. Okay, thank you. Here, have a grape. They're juicy. Nah, I got the stuff grapes grow up to be right here. Well, I've got the stuff boys grow up to be right here. (sultry music playing) Okay... You think the engine's cool enough to check on now? Hard to say. There's a lot of heat on this island. The heat of the engine, the heat between you and me, us... (music stops) What are you doing? Giving in. Join me. Giving in? What? (music resumes) We just had a brush with d*ath. Our adrenaline and our endorphins are running wild... let's go with it! (music stops) No! No, no, no! My endorphins want to go home. (music resumes) Really? Well, my endorphins think we should take turns kissing each other's faces. (whispers): You go first. Okay, I'll go first. (music stops) Whoa. Kurt, wrong idea. Cool your engines right now, buddy. (music resumes) Isn't this what you want? Adventure? Linda, you asked the universe for help, and it gave you me. Namaste. Captain, you are not cleared for landing, capisce? Kiss me, Linda, and we can fly lying down. (music stops) (grunts) Ow! What the hell? Wow, that really works. Why would you head-butt me? I was gonna punch you, but I'm holding wine. I can't believe you're rejecting me. Yeah, I'm married, you idiot. So are all my other clients. Ugh! Everything was going perfectly. What do you mean? We crash-landed. Kinda. (gasps) You didn't! (grunts) Ow! Stop it! That's for faking an emergency. And since there's nothing wrong with the plane, let's go! Now! Fine. Let me just put the lute back. That there is Quippiquisset. Good day for neckin'. Don't kiss anybody, Linda! Not that I think you would. Don't get pregnant! I want to be the baby! No! Do get pregnant! I want a brother! Or maybe get a dog first, to practice? You guys want to read some mail, take your mind off of things? All right, where'd you hide your dumb flying boat? Oh, no! No! No, no, no, no. Seriously, where's the plane? I don't know! It must have floated away! What?! How the hell does that happen? The tide came in! So now we're stuck here?! My plane! Oh, my God, oh, my God, my plane! Ow! You-you turd! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Come on! Help...! Someone get me off this stinkin' island! We're gonna starve out here, all because you thought I was so bored of my marriage that I would have s*x with some slimy seaplane pilot. Unbelievable. No. We're gonna starve 'cause you ate all the cheese. I bet that picnic wasn't even for your mother. Doy, Linda. Look, I'm not gonna apologize for giving women what they want. Women do not want to be tricked into having s*x. Well, when you say it like that, it sounds gross. Listen, buster, you stay on your side of the island, I'll stay on mine. Wait, switch sides; that side's better. (groaning) Man: Well, this is as far as I can take you. Time to reseal some of these envelopes. (chuckles): Definitely a federal offense. Nope, think you're wrong there. Not if you seal 'em back up. Right, yep. You're not gonna go tellin' on me, are ya? Nope. We got to find a way to get to Quippiquisset. Louise: Dinghy for four? Whoa, whoa, but that's not ours. Come on, Dad, suck it up. We got to get to Quicky-Kiss-it before he quicky-kisses Mom. Linda: Sheesh, this island's seen a lot of emergency landings. Hey, Linda? What, Kurt?! You got every right to hate me. Now that I've had a little time to think, I hate me, too. Yeah, 'cause you're a jerk. I'm pathetic. I chase bored housewives. Why? Because... I don't have any love in my life. No, you don't. I know, I don't. I know. I like to think there's someone out there for everyone, but, uh... but... (sobbing) (croaking, sobbing) (sobbing continues) Okay, all-all right. O... Uh, I know. O... I know. Shh... Okay, shh, stop it. Stop it. All right, come on. All right, don't be such a baby. There's probably somebody out there for you. Some freak. (moans) Hey! (grunts) (chokes) What's wrong with you? (choking): Your hands are soft. Rub my breasts. No! (grunts) Why is rowing so hard? Are we even moving? Tidal wave! Here comes another one. What is with these waves? They just keep coming! There she is! Linda! Bob? Kids? You found us! Kids, stay in the boat. It's a dinghy. Get your hands off her, Upskirt Kurt! Huh? My-my hands are nowhere near her. I don't understand. Easy, friend. We're not friends! You think we're friends? Yes, I do. Are you seeing how tan this guy is? That's all I'm seeing. Careful, Dad. Watch out for his big, strong tan hands. Hey, hey, guy. Let me tell you something... (panting): guy! (groans) In a second. I just got to catch my breath. Rowing is really hard. But you make it look so easy, Dad. No, you don't. You look horrible. Oh, God, Mom's gonna leave you for Kurt. (weak growl) Ah-ah-ah-ah, stay on your side. Ah... Ow! You punched my butt! What is it with you people? What were you even aiming for? I don't know. The rowing really k*lled me. I can't raise my hands very high. Lin, did he try anything? Oh, yeah, couple times. But I smooshed his face like this. Eh! Call her off, call her off! Hey, look, it's Mr. Fischoeder. Wha...? Mr. Fischoeder! Bob? Is that you? You look macarooned. We are! Help us! Look what I found! (Kurt gasps) Shoshana. Eh, Sho-shove it! Ha! Ow! Well, climb aboard if you want a ride. Can we ride in the plane? Sure. Okay, just wipe your feet off. Aah! Sorry to leave you, Quicky Kiss-it. We both know you haven't seen the last of Tina Belcher. So... how was the lesson? (tensely): Great. Yeah. This is way better than Rudy's. Huh? Bottomless salad bowl looking a little better now, huh, Lin? Aw, go suck on a crouton! Kurt: So, how many horses you got under the hood? Uh... I think about a thousand. Is that a lot? Oh, that's a lot. Let's see. (both whooping) Yee-hah! (whooping continues) Whoa, that boat can really zoom. Aah! Buckle your seat belts, kids! (shaking); It's getting a little bumpy. And a little fly-y! Linda: Holy crap! We're lifting off! Louise: And we are airborne, people! Yay! I got in the Mile High Club! Early admission! Hey! We got to tell them to slow down! Hey! Where's the horn on this thing? There's no horn. You should really lower the plane, guys. We know, Tina! I mean, because of that. Bridge...! (screaming) (screaming) Oh, it's also got a stereo. (tenor singing aria) Oh! All right! The plane's not lowering. We're going too fast. Then we got to go up. We got to go over the bridge. How? We have to cut the towrope somehow. Gene, hand me that toolbox. Oh, come on, there's nothing in here but massage oil and a wine opener. Wine opener! Ding! Thank you, Louise! This is no time for wine, Dad! Oh, man. You're going out there? Yes, Louise, I'm going out on the wing of an airplane. It's called a pontoon! Pontoon! Shut up, Gene! Tina: And that's called a bridge. Oh, Bobby, this is crazy; don't go out there. I have to! Okay, I can do this. (groans) (yells) Aah! Linda: Bobby, be careful. I'm trying! But also hurry, please. Yes, thank you for that! Oh, Bob, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I said you were boring. I should never have signed up for this. No, Lin, I'm sorry. I know we should go on better date nights. I... Louise: Maybe you should just have this conversation later! Yeah. She's right, she's right. I agree! That would be best! Both:  Figaro, Gigolo, Figaro, Gigolo  Gigolo, Figaro, Figaro, Gigolo...  (both continue singing with opera music) Tina: Did you save us yet, Dad? Not yet, Tina. How about now, Dad? No! I'm trying to do it! How much progress have you made? It's not a real knife, And I'm on the wing of a plane! Gene: Pontoon! Just a percent, a percent. It's looking pretty grim, Dad! Just sayin'. Bob: The constant questions aren't helping! Wait, wait, almost got it. Bob: Oh, boy. Bridge, bridge, bridge, bridge, bridge! Linda, hit it! Go up! Linda: Aah... (several screaming) Are you still there, Bob? Yes! I want to be inside now, though. Dad! Dad! Dad! Oh, Bobby! You rescued us! That was close. Oh, you're my hero. (retching) Oh, it's okay, I puked, too. Linda, you're flying. I know, right? Wait. Can you land? I mean, did you learn that? No. Oh. Oh. Well... that might be an issue. Oh. That's odd. What? Never mind. Okay. Linda: Oh, I think I know what to do. Kurt was faking it, but I watched him take this thing down. Then do that. Yeah. Now. Do it now! I am. Just got to act like we're going to crash... Crash?! Why are we gonna act like we're doing that? Here we go. (screaming, gasping) Linda: Uh, this should work. Bob: It's not working! I can do this. I feel like Amelia Earhart. Oh, God, she died. I feel like a regular captain on a regular plane. What the...? And... flair... mama! Shoshana, Shoshana, oh, oh, oh, oh, God, God, God, oh...! (screaming) (screaming, yelling, gasping) Looks like Kurt's trying to land with his pen1s again. (screaming continues) (cheering, whooping) Yes! How are we alive?! 'Cause your mom is incredible! Flying's the best! Why do we drive anywhere? Best date ever. Whoo! I have so much adrenaline pumping through my veins. Me, too. Oh, it really puts me in the mood, Bobby. Oh. Yeah, me, too. Yeah. Crash-landing really is an aphrodisiac. Kids, uh, swim to shore. Your father and I are gonna have a "Proshecco" picnic. Prosecco. Oh, yeah, that. Okay. Bye, Tina. Bob: Tina, uh, come back. Linda: We were joking. Gene: Remember, do your ice cream scoops. Linda: Ooh, now I'm hungry for ice cream.  Quicky Kiss-it  Quicky Kiss-it  Quicky Kiss-it  Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah  Quicky Kiss-it  Whoo! Quicky Kiss-it  She's kissin', she's kissin'  She's kissin' so quick  Quicky Kiss-it  Ooh! Quicky Kiss-it  Uh-huh, Quicky Kiss-it  Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah... 
All right! My Bobby's going off to college. I'm not going off to college, Lin. You don't have the grades! I'm-I'm just going to the college to fill in for Pepe, cooking at the fraternity house for a week. Aw, you're gonna have so much fun. Yeah, I don't really see what's fun about being ordered around by a bunch of frat boys. I can explain it. That's okay, Tina. All I know is we need the cash. So I'm doing it. Well, you're gonna miss me hosting one of Gretchen's LadyGood parties. What are "lady goods"? I don't know. Makeup? Tampons and pony saddles? Breast organizers? Okay, well, guess I'd better go feed Chad and Trip and Chip and Skip and all the other rich kids. You say that like we're not rich. (bells jingle) Wait, Dad. Are we not rich? (knocking) Hi. I'm the cook. I'm filling in for Pepe? Uh, looks like you guys got TP'd. Yeah, the Alpha House likes to prank us. Joke's on them, though. Free toilet paper for us! Oh, yeah. Tough to roll it back up, though. I'm the Beta president. They call me Pud. Oh, okay, Pud. I'm Bob. That's Hefty Jeff... he's the fraternity historian. Oh, uh, that's a thing? Ask me anything about the history of this frat. Uh, okay. When was it founded? Crap. Ask me something else. I'm Turd. Put her there. Hey, Turd. So Turd, Pud, um, Hefty Jeff. This is, uh... a nice place you got here. Thank you. I mean, the sofa is upside down, but... That's for hiding. And forts! Yeah. Okay. So, I'm guessing this isn't the top fraternity on campus. Oh, no. Our motto is "If you rushed us, you'd be pledged by now." Hey, worked on me. We haze with hugs. Some good huggers in this group. Girls never come here. Gretchen: How we doing, ladies? Let's give it up for Linda for hosting tonight's LadyGoods party! (cheering) (chuckles) Stop it. Now that everyone's hammered, let's look at the product line. Do you think it's appropriate to have the children here? Why wouldn't it be appropriate? Our money's as green as yours, toots! Our first LadyGood is called the Joie de Vibe, which we all know is French for "fun." (imitates vibrating) (chuckles nervously) Ha, ho! I don't know what that thing is, but the look on Mom's face is hilarious! I'll buy it! Okay, kids. Come on. Go to your room now. Yeah, go to your room, guys. You, too, missy. What? Come on. Out now. Oh, man! Grown-up stuff is going on! Ah... Okay. I love it! Gene: I want a magic vibrating club just like any other boy! Linda: Yeah. All right. Louise: Yeah! (sizzling) Bob, this burger is superb. What'd you put in there? Spices? Uh, a few. You deserve a beer. Follow me to the Fellowship Room.  Fellowship Room!  Both: Fellowship Room! So... fellowship basically means drinking. And drinking games. Like Beer Beer Goose. What's the "Slowhand Crooner Corner"? Hefty Jeff: Oof, Slowhand. Yeah, seriously. Someone's got to tell him he graduated a million years ago. Now, now, Hefty Jeff, Turd. Slowhand is a very generous Beta alum. He buys us stuff like that karaoke machine. Uh, and what's that? Beta! Beta! Beta! That's Beta. Yeah, I got that. Beta was the house iguana from '67 to '86. Only a true brother may drink from him. You drink from him? I ate lndian food out of him once. You're not supposed to. (window slides open) We're out upstairs. Oh, hey, Bob. Did you drive here? Uh, yeah. Why? Maybe it's time to "go to the library." Tonight? We're supposed to wait. Bob can drive. And we're the perfect level of drunk. To go to the library? Yeah. Could you give us a ride to campus? I can't drive at night 'cause I don't have a car. Okay. Moving on, this one is called Here Comes the Sun. It's solar-powered so you leave it on your porch all day. Any takers? No? Okay. Linda. Linda. What, what, what? (quietly): I'm dying here. This crowd is all married, boring people who suck. You got to help me. What? No. I can't sell anything. I can't s... You'll be fine, you'll be fine. Linda swears by this thing, don't you, Linda? You know, because of your problems with your husband? Yeah! Uh, Bob's got a condition that makes him, uh, s*x bad. My husband's got that. It's called being married for 20 years. (laughter) Being married for 20 years! She says being married! (chuckles) Ah... I'll take the one with the hand crank, for camping. (laughter) Okay! Who wants more wine? So, where's the library? It's just up ahead. (moans) I'm really nervous. The library must be different than how I'm imagining it. Pud: Stop here. Okay, uh, this isn't the library. At all. Hey, would you mind waiting here? And keep the engine running. What are they doing with that fish and that air conditioner? Oh. They're putting the fish in the air conditioner. That's a good prank. Kind of. No, it's not. (others chattering quietly) Hefty Jeff: Yeah, we did it! (laughing, chattering) (siren chirping) Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Everybody, be cool! Oh, God. Oh, God. (hyperventilating): Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Evening, sir. Evening, uh, Officer. I'm, uh, teaching a class on, um... creative... driving. Creative driving? Yeah, it's a special, um... (whispers): Elective. elective. Pass-fail. It's pass-fail, but that's... (chuckles) unnecessary information. (quietly): You're an adjunct professor. I got it. All right. Have a good class, Professor. Really? Go, go, go, go! Bob, you're a hero. You made the prank. You're a sick old man. Is that a good thing? Yes! Gentlemen, I think Bob deserves a beer. Uh, you just gave me one, so I'm good. I didn't finish. Bob deserves a beer... out of Beta. (chanting): Beta, Beta, Beta! Wow, really? Are-are you sure? I mean, that's disgusting, t... (chanting): Beta, Beta! Wow. Which end do I drink from? Dealer's choice. Uh, I guess I'll-I'll do mouth. You don't know what you're missing from the butt, Bob. All right, I'll do butt. (cheering) Oh, my God. I just drank from a lizard's butt! Reload! No, no, no. I'm good, guys. I'm good. Well, maybe one more.  Every time I scratch my nails down someone else's back  I hope you feel it  Do you feel it?!  (whoops) Betas! (cheering) Bob: Yeah, give me the lizard again! Turd: I'll go get it! A: You're off to the frat house already? Yeah, the guys are playing Beer Beer Goose, so I'm gonna make lunch. You know, now I kind of regret not going to college. You regret not going to college? Come on. It's not like you ended up flipping burgers. Oh, wait... Why don't you take the kids with you? A house full of boys? I can't go. I have plans. Just kidding. Let's go. Hey! There he is! Everybody, Bob's here! (cheering) (chuckles) Uh, hey, guys. I brought my kids. This is great. I can't not step on cold pizza. Upside-down couch for hiding? And forts. This is the biggest man-cave ever. And Tina's going spelunking. No, Tina. No. Pud: Hey, Bob. (quietly): Word of warning: Slowhand's here. Slowhand? Oh, oh, the alum? Yeah, he's in the bathroom. (toilet flushes) Shh, guys, I think he's coming. Comin' back from the bathroom entrance music! (imitates hip-hop beat) Dr. Yap? I thought I'd never see you again until my next dental appointment. You're Slowhand? Bob, what are you doing here? I'm filling in for the cook. Oh, great, great. Hi, kids. How are you doing? Are you flossing, Beana? (chuckles) Yap, yap, yap, yap. (chuckles) Hey, you signed up for the Slowhand Memories Tour? Actually, I should get into the kitchen. Leaving now! Keep up! and that's where I had my first French hug. That's where you feel a girl's armpits. We done, Yap? We've hit every room in the house. Not every room. Behind this very door are Betas' greatest treasures, our darkest mysteries and our washer-dryer. Pause for laughter. Only brothers may enter the Room of Secrets, (echoes): Secrets, Secrets, Secrets. Shh. You kids want to see inside, huh? Sure. No! What did I tell you? Brothers only. Okay, Yap, we get it. Moving on. Last stop. That was the last stop. You said that was the last stop. Dr. Yap: Yap, yap, yap, yap. One more. There's one more thing. Yeah, the best way to keep your secrets hidden is to put 'em in a room labeled "Room Of Secrets." Damn it! And finally, the Beta House Wall of Honor. Hey, wait a second. What's this? Whoa, Hefty Jeff, you framed that already? I'm the house historian. His dad owns a frame shop. Are you freaking kidding me?! Slowhand, calm down. No, you calm down, Pud! You let a non-brother drink out of Beta?! And he crooned in my Crooner Corner? "B" to the "S"! It's okay. Bob helped us prank the crap out of the Alphas. You'll prank with these guys but you won't prank with us? We put the dead fish in their AC. What?! That was my prank! Why wasn't I in on my prank? You should have called me! I put my number in all of your cell phones. Bob had a car, the fish was starting to smell... I bought that fish! That's why when I have a fish I write my name on it in permanent marker. Sorry, Yap. I didn't know it was your fish. You're right, Slowhand, we screwed up. If you want to take time off from hanging out here, we would understand. No, that won't be necessary. The important thing is you guys finally sacked up and pranked those Alphas. Yeah, Operation Bob-Fish was a huge success. Yap-Fish! It was a Yap-Fish! (whispering): History will say it was a Bob-Fish. I'm so proud of my dad. Gretchen: That stuff about Bob's problems in the bedroom was great. You are a natural saleswoman. Thanks! Selling's easy. You just tell lies about your husband and you're all set. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Throw it all out. What? Different crowd. See that woman crying over there? Linda: Yeah. Gretchen: The one with too much eye shadow. Oh, it's awful. No, I know. Anyway, she just got dumped. You tell me why. Aw. Her friends threw her this party. Right. Think you got an angle for her? Maybe. Yes. I don't know. Good. Save it. Okay. Let's go sell some s*x toys! (whoops) Ow. Ow. What? And Linda? Here. Your own Pleasureologist coat. (gasps) Aw! Welcome to the Pleasureologist family. (sobs) Hey. Listen, sweetie. I just broke up, too. Huh? Yeah. I broke up with my husb... my boyfriend. Oh, yeah? Bob. Jerk. But guess what. I found somebody better. The Sneaky Pete! Oh, hi, it's nice to meet you. (laughs) What's your name? I'm Susan. Susan, hi. Hi, Pete. I like you, Susan. I got a crush on you. I never felt this way before. I want to go home with you with your bedside drawer and live there forever. (giggles) Oh, now she's smilin'. (whoops) We got another one! Tell her about the holster. Tina: Dad, what do you think the frat boys keep in their Room of Secrets? I don't know, Tina, but whatever it is, it attracts ants. Well, don't you worry. Today we're getting in or Gene dies trying. You got it! Guys, you heard Dr. Yap. That room is off-limits to non-brothers. You're not a brother. I'm basically a brother. I'm more of a brother than you are, Gene. You've never even touched the iguana! I drank from its ass! Are you okay, Dad? (sighs) I just... I like those guys. And-and they like me. And it's not just because we're always drunk. Oh, my God. Tina: Dr. Yap! What happened here? The Alphas hit us, man! They got us, man! Pretty hard, bro! This could be payback for Operation Bob-Fish. Yap-Fish. And the worst thing is they took... they took... A long, hard look at your lifestyle? No! They took Beta! (screams) Beta! No! I want everyone to see what the Alphas did to me. What happened, Slowhand? I just came by the house with a new karaoke CD... Steady Rocking Booty Jams. Volume Two. Suddenly, the Alpha president barged in with his foot soldiers. First they held me down and shaved me, then they flung me over here, and shoved me over there, and beat up my face! And then they took Beta! (gasps) Oh, and they left this. Hefty Jeff: No, no, no, no, no! Friggin' Alphas! They have no respect for anything! I'm gonna go pee out the window. You pee out the window? That settles it: I'm going to college! Poor Beta. You drank out of his butt. What are the standards here? In my day, if the Alphas hit us, we hit 'em back twice as hard! Brothers, this is war. And if that means I need to move back into the house for the foreseeable future, so be it. And it does mean that. Oh... okay. Get my room ready, Turd! I'm in. Not... I mean, not to move in. But to help. We won't... probably won't need you at all, Bob. I'll do... I'll do whatever. I'm in it for the long haul, brothers! Yeah, we need Bob now more than ever! Yeah! Bob's one of us! All right, it's... All right, it's fine. Thanks, Bob. You're in. Let's get 'em! Yeah! Let's get 'em! Yeah! Louise: Yeah, go get 'em! Take your time, don't come back for a while! Betas! Room of Secrets, time to spill your guts!

Pud: "Due to reports of property damage, "Beta Upsilon Pi fraternityis. Signed, Dean Dixon." Stupid Dean Dixon! I hate that guy! Is it a guy? He's the dean. He's nice. Well, probation or not, this isn't over until we show the Alphas they can't get away with disrespecting our lizard. What about Dean Dixon's letter? Shouldn't we lay low? Turd's got a point. Thank you. I'm one semester away from graduating. Oh, Pud, there are no jobs out there. You know that, right? Listen to Bob. Even though he's technically not even a brother. Well, if Bob's on board... You know I'm on board, T-bird. Yeah, B-bow. The B-T express! (chuckles) Choo choo! We're coming to awesome town! Okay, yeah... Just two passengers today, Turd and Bob! Brother... (imitates train whistle) Brothers, and not-really brothers, I give you... Operation Spit Take. Wow. Wow. If I can't get the secrets out, I'm gonna put my secrets in. (quietly): I have a cat under my bed. I've had it for eight months. (quietly): I know about Gene's secret cat. (groans) I can't believe we'll never know what secrets are in the Room of Secrets! Or what laundry is in the Room of Secrets. Wait a minute. If the building's old and crappy, there might be a laundry chute. Oh, that's weird. I was correct. Ladies. (whoops) (whoops) Whoo-whoo-hoo! (grunts) Let's check out some secrets. I'm good. Tina! Yeah? Those aren't yours. Oh, how-how'd these get on? Dr. Yap: Tonight, none other than Dean Dixon is hosting a banquet recognizing campus community service. And their guest of honor? Guess who. It's the president of those iguana-thieving Alphas! Getting a special award for their so-called "dedication to raising thousands of dollars for cancer research." Others: Boo! But what this douchebot doesn't know is that an award for fighting cancer isn't all he's going to get tonight! Yeah, not if the Betas have anything to do with it. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! To the Beta-mobile! We've got Alphas to crush! Oh, crap, the kids. Uh, you guys g-go ahead. I'll meet you there. Uh, Betas! Check out the past brothers. Mmm, if those sideburns could talk. Here's a magazine about jugs. Their secret is they love pottery? Did I mishear them? Is this actually called the Room of Suck-rets? No, I think we heard them correctly. It's the Room of Secrets. Well, these secrets suck! Oh, here's Dr. Yap's class. It's Beta! And a bunch of tiny clothes. Oh, Beta's starting his own fashion line. No, dummy. This means the Alphas never stole the iguana! Hey, you guys aren't supposed to be in... Beta? We found him in the wall behind Dr. Yap's class photo. Why would Beta be here in the house? Unless Yap made up that whole story. He wouldn't. He would. He would. He would. Who would? Dr. Yap. Oh, yeah, he would. Oh, my God. We have to stop him before he gets those kids kicked out of school. It's all right, they can move in with us. Dibs on Turd. (grumbles) Bob: I can't believe it. Yap made up the whole thing? He's been pranking his own frat! It's the ones you least suspect. Sometimes. Not this time. (indistinct conversations) Oh, good, Bob. I thought you might have wussed out. You're just in time to see the Alphas pay for taking Beta. I know what you did, Yap. It's over. Recognize this iguana? (gasping) Recognize this iguana tail? Or these briefs? Just curious. They're mine now. Okay, Bob, you got me. I took Beta. I thought a prank war would bring the brothers together and show them how much I mean to them. So it wasn't the Alphas at all. Those damn Alphas don't even know we exist. Yeah, they seem pretty focused on their charity work. I've been TPing our house for years just to get this thing going. Okay, this fake prank war ends now. The brothers are already on probation, Yap. Prank the Alphas here and you'll get the house shut down. So what? They'll be legends! Oh, no. What's the prank, Yap? Well, since you're too late to stop it, I'll tell you. First, I dressed as a waiter and snuck into the banquet while they were setting up. Oh, my God, how long is this story? Yap: Then I drilled a hole in the stage, and underneath I planted the splatter-master saliva keg! The what? Are you insane? I don't know. Is it insane to collect the spit of every patient who's passed through my office for the past six months and put it in a pony keg? Absolutely. Not necessarily. Hmm... No. Right now, all the Betas are under the stage with the keg, waiting for that Dean Dixon to introduce his Alpha lapdog. And when the Alpha president steps up to the podium? Sploosh. This is a great plan. We're doing this! No, we're not, Louise. Come on, Yap. No! It's all so easy for you, isn't it, Bob? You just moseyed into the Beta house and stole their hearts with your hamburgers and your perfect body. Yap, I'm sorry, okay? And I get it. The fraternity's great. It's like being in a family of guys with beer and karaoke. Sucker punch! (grunts) We're definitely switching dentists! No! You'll never get a better family dentist who's in your provider network! (laughing) Dixon: Hello, I'm Dean Dixon, and you're all expelled. Just kidding. Except for you, you're expelled. Just kidding. Oh, God. He started his intro. I've got to do something. You're too late, Dad. You'll never stop it now. I've got to try. Uh, now I'd like to introduce a truly outstanding young man... Me! Hello! I am the honoree's, uh, twin brother. Hmm? But I'm 20 years old. Excuse me. Uh... That's okay, Dean. Thanks. Have a seat. You know what I like about my brother? He's nice. He-he wouldn't hurt a fly, much less... I don't know, I'm just naming animals here... an iguana. Louise: Boo! Please have her removed. I want everyone in the room to know, even people who might be under the stage right now, that the Alpha president would not hurt or kidnap an iguana. Right? Maybe he would! No, he wouldn't! Those are the kind of things our crazy oldest brother would do, though. You know, our crazy, Asian dentist older brother? I'd point him out, but I have a slow hand. A slow hand. Dad should leave the jokes to Dean Dixon. Ha, ha. Ha, ha, ha. Come on, help Dad out. (quietly): Are you talking to us? (quietly): Don't set off the spit keg. Um, let's go out and ask him what he means. Hi. How are you? Excuse me, who are these young men? I probably should have come to rehearsal. (screaming) (slow motion): No, Yap, no! Dad, um, you've got a little... On your... Bit right here. I did it! Betas! Yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap! What-what are we working with here? What's goin' on? Are these cougars? Cougar, cougar... Linda: Oof. Cougar. Kind of a cougar-poodle mix. Linda: Uh-huh. Cougar-doodle. Linda: Aw. Ah! Oh, ho, ho, ho. Wow. Cougar-doodle opened the sample case. Yeah, they're very smart. (bell jingles) Bobby! Why are you all wet? Wow, hi, guys. I brought the guys for burgers. I've kind of been forgetting to feed them. Sorry Dean Dixon banned you and Slowhand from campus. But thank you. 'Cause, you know, you de-Yapified us. With that guy banned from the frat, my GPA might go up. Yeah, sorry Yap called you a nerd for doing homework. And that I said I agreed with him.  (purrs, laughs, barks) What is... what is happening right now? What is this? Go for it, man. I don't know what to do from here. Beta rules! Uh, uh, uh, uh. How do you like that? Why are none of these guys interested? (whoops) Tonight everybody gets hazed! My sisters are my brothers! I'm gonna go pee out a window! Wait, why is everybody holding vibrators?  He is freaky, freaky, freaky  Sneaky Pete  He's unique-y, nique-y, nique-y  Sneaky Pete  Make you shrieky, shrieky, shrieky  Sneaky Pete  Ah-ah, Sneaky  Sneaky Pete  He is freaky, freaky, freaky  Sneaky Pete  He's unique-y, nique-y, nique-y  Sneaky Pete  Make you shrieky, shrieky, shrieky  Sneaky Pete.  Linda: I want to go home with you with your bedside drawer and live there forever.
Louise: Dad, why are you massaging the turkey now? Maybe it's tense. I'll make it some tea. I'm doing a three-day salt rub. I call it Father of the Brine. Huh? Ha! Thank you. It's special since we're having Teddy, Mort... (barking) ...and your Aunt Gayle over. I don't see why Gayle and her cats have to stay with us all week. She had to vacate her place because of the fire, Bob. She put her dental dams in the dryer. What are dental dams? Nothing. Forget it. Don't say it at school. Didn't she used to only have one cat? Ah, she adopted one last week. And then she found one on her way over here. She's a cat magnet. Oh, it was so sad. He was just sitting... on someone's porch, poor little guy. Just sittin' there. Just sitting there in the sun. Aah. (sneezes) Ugh. Ugh, cat hair. Take one of the allergy pills I got you! Well, Dad, I hope you're not allergic to melody and rhythm and sexy lyrics, 'cause our guests are gonna love my Thanksgiving song! Ugh. Every year, I try and tell you guys that no one really sings Thanksgiving songs. You bite your tongue! Think about it. Why aren't there any Thanksgiving carols? I'm gonna write a classic and make a million dollars! And then I'm gonna buy a car! I believe in you, Gene. I'll be in your...  Song...!  Great, but you don't get any of the profits, and I'm going to be very critical. Ha! I love it! (keyboard plays gentle tune) Welp, good luck with your song. And don't be offended if everyone's talking about how great my turkey is while you're trying to sing. Sounds like someone's afraid of being upstaged. (meowing) You are. You are. (sneezes) Oh, God. Get out of here! Bob, stop hitting my cats! And God bless you. I'm not hitting them! I'm petting their rear legs. Tina: Mom? Whoa! I need your opinion on something. Ooh, I love it! Braveheart meets Coco Chanel! I need to decide which color I'm wearing when I sit at the adults' table on Thursday. No, no lipstick, Tina. You're-you're too young. And you're sitting at the kids table like you always do when we have guests. Yup, we sit on the floor at the coffee table and put our vegetables under the couch. You should look under there. It's fascinating now! But I bought pantyhose! And I've been working on Tina's talking points. How's this one? (clears her throat) "In this economy?" Oh, provocative! That's it. I... You know, I'm in charge of Thanksgiving. Gene, Linda, no song. What?! Tina, no adults table. Aw! Louise, whatever you're planning, do not do it. I need some peace and quiet. I want to focus on the turkey. Everyone, just go to bed. Bob, it's 6:30. I don't care! Just go to bed! You love that turkey more than you love us! That's right! I do! I love turkeys! Okay. Now go! (dog barking) (grunting) (birds singing) (muttering) (door squeaks open) What the...? Oh, my God! No! Lin! Lin! What? What happened? What happened? Wha...? The turkey... it's in the toilet! What are you talkin' about? You had a bad dream. Go back to sleep. This is not a dream. This is happening. (Tina yells) Tina! There was something in the toilet, and I sat on it. It was cold, and now I don't know if I'll ever be able to go to the bathroom again. Oh, my God, the turkey's in the toilet! Get off of there! (yowls) What the cuss word?! Who pooped that, and may I apprentice with you? What is this, a pee-pee party? You people are fun, all going at once! Oh, God. Oh. Aah! Aah! All: Ugh! Ugh! Get it out of their litter box! Quick, Bob! They're vegetarians! Oh, my God, I'm gonna barf. I'm gonna b... Oh, my God, what is happening?! Okay, so really? No one is going to confess? Louise? It wasn't me! Louise? It wasn't! Fine. So, no one, including Louise, wants to admit that they did this? I'm giving you guys one more chance to confess, and then I'm grounding everyone, including your mom and Gayle. Bobby! No, it's fine with me. I don't have any plans. Bobby, it wasn't us. It was Louise. Come on. Or, uh, maybe Gene. (gasps) How dare you?! I put food in the toilet the way God intended. It had to be Louise. Unbelievable. Does everyone think I did it? (all voicing assent) Well, then, I must be guilty. That's how it works, right? Yup. Perfect system. Well, I have to go get another turkey. Which means I can only do a two-day brine, which is not as good as a three day-brine! But I'm not forgetting this. I will figure out who did it. Even though I'm pretty sure we all still think it was Louise. Make sure you save room at Thanksgiving for the words you'll be eating! Wait. Are you gonna throw that one out? Yes, Gene, it was soaking in toilet water. And rolled in cat feces. Oh, God, I'm gonna barf again. No, no, no. Lin, please! Oh, my God, I'm gonna barf! Ugh! (retching) Wait a second. You just got a turkey yesterday. Yup. Turkey number two, huh? Messed up the first one? No, it's a long story. Not so easy to just step into the kitchen, is it? No, actually, I'm a professional cook. Yeah. You and me both, right? Okay, don't mess this one up. I-I didn't... Next! I-I didn't mess it up! Turkey in the toilet? That's crazy. It's not that crazy. I've seen crazier things in a toilet. You wouldn't believe what I've seen. I've seen a rat wearing a little hat. What? Twice. Same rat, different hat. I got a picture. Hold on. Wait. Is this the toilet turkey? No, I got a new one. What did you do with the old one? What do you mean, what did I do? I threw it out. You threw out a perfectly good turkey? It wasn't perfectly good, Teddy. It was in the toilet. Ugh. Why does everyone want to eat food from the toilet all of a sudden? Guys, I found the picture! Rat in a hat. Oh, my God. Hmm. Three days I waited on a stakeout for that rat to come back, and he looks at me... and he looks at me like, "What are you lookin' at?" Gene: Come on, Mom, Gayle, focus! We've only got two days left to make a Thanksgiving song that will be passed down for generations. And a one, and a two. I don't know about these lyrics. What?! Gayle, you are a guest here. You will sing what you are given. No, Gene, Gayle's right. This song's kind of meh. It needs a little gravy. (gasps) That's it! No one's done a song about gravy. Think about it. Hmm. Gravy. Rhymes with wavy, oopsie daisy, Patrick Swayze. All right, I'm in! Anyone mind if I turn on the news? Aah! I'm okay. You fell like a real lady. Thank you, young man. (clears throat) Hello, hi. Hi. Hi, Gayle. You look great. Louise, look at you. Did you do your hair? No. Love it. Gene. Hi. What a nice shirt you're wearing. Thank you. Excellent. I just want to say that I've calmed down from this morning, and in the spirit of the holidays, whoever did this, I am granting you a full pardon. Oh, I really thought that would work. Seriously, who put the turkey in the toilet?! (laughing): Oh, Dad. If I may. I've taken the liberty of drawing up a little chart here. Let's review our suspects. Tina. She'd stop at nothing for some grownup stuffing. Did her table envy drive her over the edge? No. Gene. He thinks there's only room for one bird at this table. A song bird. (gasps) Do-re-me?! Louise: Or was it Gayle? Dad went after her cats, she went after his turkey. Classic revenge tale. Classic. Louise: Or maybe, maybe Linda. Oh, sweet Linda. A long-suffering wife stuck in a bad marriage. Aw, poor thing! Lin! What? I got caught up in the story. She's good. And that leaves Louise, who had no motive at all. Thank you. The end. Thank you. What an imagination on this one, huh? Kids. Mmm. So, do you know who did it? Oh. No. Uh-uh. Then what's the point of all this? Hold on. I just had an idea. Was it you, Gayle?! Huh? Confess! Damn it, Gayle! (screams) Or you?! Confess! You're guilty as hell! (grunts) Louise? What? Stop. Why? This isn't working. I guess I'll just never trust any of you again, forever, for as long as I live. Another great family meeting! Good night, everyone! Good night! Good night, Bob! Night, night! Good night, Dad! Do you want my charts to take into your room for review? No. Just go to bed then. (grunting) (creing) (bird singing) (muttering) (yelling): No! Okay, fun's over! I want a name! Gene! Oh, come on! You know I don't go into the bathroom at night because of the shower ghost. Ah, that's him! It's got to be Tina! Tina wouldn't do something this immature. I accept your invitation to sit at the adults' table. No, Tina. Maybe it was me! Was it? No. I just started to feel left out. I don't know, Gayle. You are really... weird. That's true. Come on, it wasn't Gayle. Is that a confession, Mom? What? That's crazy. Well, you aren't always the most trustworthy person, Linda. What!? Me!? Yes, you. That time you changed the channel when I was out of the room. What are you talking about? Oh, don't play innocent! It was Quantum Leap, and I'll never know where he leapt! You know where he leapt. Flush! Gene, stop! We need to get rid of the body! What if someone sees? Stop. Oh. Hi, uh, I need two turkeys, please. Oh. You again. Uh... yeah. Look, I think I know what's going on here and, uh... I'm flattered, but I'm in a relationship. What? Oh, no, no. I'm not trying to... Hey, hey. Listen, Daddy, don't you let one rejection keep you from getting out there. You seem great. Okay, thanks. There's a whole group of guys out there who don't care about what guys look like. Uh... could I just get my turkey, please? You know, I got a friend... he's into Sloppy Bears. Wha-What's a Sloppy Bear? You know, you got the muffin top, you got food on your shirt. God, I... I do. Let me set you up. I'll tell you what. I'm gonna write down their number on the receipt. You take it, and you do what you want. No, no, no, I think you have the wrong idea. I'm not interested in a gay... yeah. Uh-huh, I know, you're not interested. In a relationship. That's cool. Here's the number. I'll talk to you later. Get out of here! Linda: Bob! Who is it? It's me. Open up. Uh-uh. Come on! No! Come on! No. I need to get into the bedroom. My armpits need a second coat of deodorant. I need to re-odorize. I stink! Ugh. I don't know. Bobby, you're being crazy. Uh... fine, but close your eyes. Bobby, what are you doing? Hey, I said, eyes closed. You know my eyes don't completely close. I'm sorry, but I can't trust anyone. Oh, Bob, what's with the two turkeys? Nothing! Hey! You calm down! Now, come on, stop it. Okay, I'll tell you, but you can't tell anyone. Oh, I won't! Who would I tell? Come on, it's me! Okay, one's a decoy turkey for the upstairs fridge. The real turkey will be downstairs in the walk-in. Ha, ha! Bobby... It's a good plan, right? Yeah. Yeah, I thought of it. You, my smart guy. Sometimes. Devious little turkey roaster in the bedroom. Well, well, maybe a little bit. You want to mess around? What? I don't know, all these turkeys... it makes me horny. Well, not, not right now, Lin, no. You sure? Okay, maybe a little. That's my boy. (both moaning) Ooh, ooh, I really do need deodorant. Yeah, you really do. Whew, I stink. Wow. Put your face in it. No, I don't want... Come on, put your face in it, put your face in it. I don't... no, I don't want to go there. Put your face in it. It's coming at you. All right, get out.    (snoring) (door opens) Tina: Oh, no, Dad. No, no, no, no, no, I fell asleep. Sorry for your loss. No, Tina, I'm sorry for whoever thought they could ruin Thanksgiving. Follow me to the walk-in. What?! No! (whimpers) Tina: A turkey in every toilet. Only in America, huh, guys? It was you, Lin, it's been you all along. Say it. No, Bobby, no, it wasn't me. You were the only one who knew about the second turkey. It had to be you. I knew about the second turkey. What? Lin! You know I tell Gayle everything, Bobby. She's my sister. It's true, I know everything, like that time you peed in the theater during Jerry Maguire. I didn't want to miss any of it! Mom told me, too. About peeing during Jerry Maguire or the turkey? Both. Mom and I shop together. We don't have any secrets. So all three of you knew? Louise and I knew, too. Mom's like a vault that's constantly open and constantly talking. Hey, I told you guys not to tell anyone I told you. Okay, Thanksgiving is officially canceled. For everyone or just for our family? Bob... No, Lin, I've had it. Thanksgiving's ruined. There's no time to do the Father of the Brine on a new turkey, plus I'm way over the Thanksgiving budget. This is the worst Thanksgiving ever. Okay, calm down. No, I will not calm down! (sneezes, groans) Hey, let's all forget about Thanksgiving and move on to Christmas. I'll go get the decorations. No, you know what? I take it back. I'm not canceling Thanksgiving. Yay. Whoever's doing this, I'm not going to let you win! Thanksgiving is back on! There will be a turkey, a stupid saltless turkey. You can put a turkey in a toilet, but you can't put me in a toilet! It kind of sounds like you want us to try to put you in a toilet. No, Louise, I don't want to be put in a toilet. Okay, but it sounded like that. It did sound like that, Bob. Let's try... one, two, three. (groans) Hey, you again, huh? Oh, hey, you again and me, yep. I-I just, uh, I came for a, uh... I suppose you want another "turkey." Yes, that's exactly what I want... a turkey. I didn't come for anything el... Okay, fine, you wore me down. Damn it. Uh... Things are not going great with Tony. Haven't been great with Tony for a long time, you know? Tony's hot, but maybe it's time for me to just settle. Look... uh, no, no, no. Look at me, I'm nothing. You, you love Tony, stay with Tony. I'm so sick of Tony and his dancing. Oh, no, I d... I don't know Tony, but I-I assume it's great. It's not great with Tony. You should definitely stay with Tony. No, no, no. Yo, I'm taking my break! Oh, my God, we're doing this. No, we're not. Hey, what do you want to do? I don't... nothing. You want to go to the beach, huh? No, maybe... wait, I'm straight. I mean, I'm mostly straight. Let's grab a coffee. You should call Tony. No, let's just have s*x! Ah, God, this feels so great! I should just... sorry, I got to go cook this. Also I'm married, but if I wasn't... Who am I kidding? You're out of my league. It would never work. What are you talking about? I really got to go. I'm gonna see you tomorrow. Probably not. I'll call you. (gasps) It's almost too obvious. The table looks beautiful, Linda. Whoa, candles shaped like little pilgrims. Those can't be cheap. Yes, Linda, what a lovely spread. Oh, interesting, Teddy, looks like you're over here. Okay, where am I? Tina, Teddy isn't sitting at the kids' table, honey, no. It's okay, Lin, it'll be like I'm eating at a Japanese restaurant. I'll take my shoes off. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no! Bob: Ha, I did it, I did it! What, Bob, what did you do? I cooked a turkey! Oh, wow. This guy's always fishing for compliments. Turkey's done. Okay, everyone sit... Tina, not you. You thought you could stop me, but you can't. Oh, hello, everybody. One of you must be very unhappy to see this. Bob, you look terrible. Yeah, because I was up all night trying to stop a turkey m*rder*r. Okay, before I serve the turkey... Wait, Tina, what are you doing? I'm standing at the adults' table? Tina, go sit down at the kids' table. Fine, I'll go check in on the little ones. I'm great with them. So, as I was saying, to the t*rror1st who tried to stop me from serving this, I want it on the record that turkey was served on this day! (Louise clears throat) But, but, before we do that, I need to serve some justice because I know who put the turkey in the toilet.  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun!  Oh, my God, she's got it, she's got it. Peas and carrots... At first I wondered, who could be mad enough at Dad to do such a thing? I mean, sure, no one likes him. Louise. And he smells. But then I realized that I was looking at the wrong motive. The person who put the turkeys in the toilet was actually angry at me! Oh, my God. What are we doing? You see, this person knew that I would be blamed and potentially punished for this heinous crime. So, was it Mom? Don't think so. Correct, it was not. Was it Gayle? I don't know. No, it wasn't. Oh. Which brings us to Gene and Tina. At first I actually believed that Gene was too scared of the shower ghost to go into the bathroom at night, and I believed Dad's theory that Tina was too mature to do something like this. If she was acting alone. But what if... they were working together?! I knew it. I can see it. That one's got crazy eyes. Tina: Gene taking the turkey out of the refrigerator each night and passing it to Tina, who dropped it in. Yes! They worked together to frame me because I have been slowly stealing their allowances over the last five years. Wait, you have? You have? Yes... wait, you guys didn't know that? No. No. Oh, never mind 'cause I haven't been. (sighs) Oh, good. Okay, uh, and now, before we eat... wait, no one eat... we... Teddy, drop it! We would like to present our Thanksgiving song. No, Lin, it's time to cut the tur... Yay, all right. Get over here, Gene, hit it, come on. A one, two, three, four.  A ding, a ding  A-what's that sound?  It's the gravy boat  Both:  A-comin' around  It's not a navy boat  It's the gravy boat  Filled with bravery  Savory sailor folk  Sailors in your mouth  Sailors in your mouth.  (Bob snoring) Bobby? Hey, Bobby. (mumbling) Bobby? Huh? Bob, come back. What are you...? Dad? He's taking the turkey. Huh, is this part of the show? Are we supposed to grab something? No, no, no. I'm getting the potatoes. Wait for me, Bobby. No, n-n-n-no. Wait for me, Bobby. Aah! (mumbling) What the...? Dad's a sleepwalker? Not normally. Should we wake him? Never wake a sleepwalker; They could get violent. And whatever you do, don't give him an ax. What, an ax? Why would we give him an ax? Don't! Let's give him an ax! Okay, Tina, do you have to go pee-pee or poo-poo? Oh, my God, he thinks the turkey's Tina. Why does Dad think I'm a turkey? Your cocky strut. I don't know, unless... (gasps) He must be remembering toilet-training you. Potty. Yeah, there it is... Tina's poo-poo potty. All right, who's a big girl? He potty-trained all you kids. I couldn't stomach it. (gagging): The stinky babies. Just the thought of it. My dad toilet-trained me. It was the worst seven years of my life... seven to 14. I like to think I trained the toilet. It didn't teach me anything. Oh, stinky. Oh, it's kind of sweet. Oh, my God, there goes the stuffing. Oh, God, oh, God. Wow, Tina, you really had to go. Aah, we're losing stuffing! Oh, it's nice. (gags) You have to stop him before he drops the turkey in. Okay. Aah! No, don't wake him. Aah! Ow, what-what's going on? No! Hold his arms and legs so he can't attack. Give me some help here! Ah, Dad, if you're still asleep, can I borrow a hundred bucks? Can I get a neck tattoo? Let go of me! It's for your own good! Aah! What's happening? Who's fighting me? It's your friend! (grunts) No, no, no, no, no, bad kitties. It's the end of the world! Go on, get, get, go! It's for your own good, Bobby! Aah, let go! Finally something to be thankful for! Linda: It was the allergy pills. Says right here. "Side effects include sleepwalking, sleep talking, "night terrors, and dry mouth. "Contact your doctor if you lose vision or if your heart stops beating." Huh. That doesn't explain why Dad kept dreaming about toilet-training me. Yeah, the same dream over and over. It's got to mean something, like the time I dreamt about a dolphin and I woke up and my bed was on fire. What did that dream mean? Just that I didn't have balance in my life... I was spending too much time at work. Also, I shouldn't leave matches right by my bed. I had just gone to the aquarium; It probably had something to do with that. Oh, my God, Bobby, don't you see? You were worried about Tina growing up 'cause she wanted to sit at the adults' table. You see how it works? Ooh, Dad loves Tina. I knew it. It's okay, Dad, even if I sit at the adults' table, I'll still be your little girl. Just because I've got the hang of pooping and peeing in the potty doesn't mean I don't need your help with other things, like homework or faxing. I don't know how to fax. Mom, can you help me fax something right now? It's okay, Tina, I know you've got to grow up sometime. Just maybe no lipstick yet. Okay. And no panty hose. I don't think anyone still wears those, right? Not in this economy. Tina. Aw, I love my little family. Come here, family hug, come here, aw. You, too, Gayle. That's nice. Come on, come on, yeah, here we go. Hey, Teddy, Mort, come on, what are you doing? Come over here. I can see from here. What the hell? (overlapping chatter) Ow, Teddy, why are you hugging so hard? Because I'm full of love, Bob. Hug. Okay, Gene, time to go poo-poo. (meows) (sneezes)  A ding, a ding  A-what's that sound?  It's the gravy boat  Both:  A-comin' around  It's not a navy boat  It's the gravy boat  Filled with bravery  Savory sailor folk  Stuffing sailors disembark  Fill our plates and fill our hearts  Sailors in your mouth, sailors in your mouth  That's what Thanksgiving is all about. 
(rock music playing)  Yeah!  Yeah!  We're Bad Hair Day! Thank you! Wow! (laughs) Okay. I think we know the winner of this talent show. But we have one more band. Uh... "The Ta-Ta's"? Give it up. Um, hello. Hello? (microphone feedback screeching) (monotone):  We're the Ta-Ta's  And we're gonna rock ya  We like to cha-cha and eat frittatas...  (crowd booing) (mumbling) Boy: Bring back Bad Hair Day! Oh, my face! Linda: Yeah. Uh-huh. Wait. You want us to do what?! No, no, no. No way. Debbie, no! De... I said no, Debbie! Good-bye! What is Debbie's problem?! And who is Debbie? She's organizing my 25-year high school reunion. Why does that make you so angry? Dish, girl. Because she wants my high school band to play there, and I don't want to be humiliated all over again! Right. Your reunion. So, are we going? Are we not going? I mean, I'll do whatever. Eh, I don't think I want to go now. Oh, thank God! I'm confused. Why wouldn't they get the other band? You know, the one that totally dominated you guys at the talent show? What were they called? Bad Hair Day? Aah! Don't you speak those words in this house! Bad hair day. Doo! Bad hair day. Gah! Bad hair day. Dat! If you must know, Louise, we were not Debbie's first choice or second or third. I think her exact words were, "I am desperate and out of ideas." Eh, I wouldn't read too much into that. Mom, time-out. This is your big chance. Don't hide your Ta-Ta's under a bush. You've got to get the band back together and play at the reunion. Tina, shush! Sorry, but reunions are horrible. High school is horrible. I mean, it'll be fine for you. Oh, good. Guess Dad doesn't want to go. Look, it was fun when we were just making up songs in Angie Moscatone's garage, but then it was horribly ruined forever. Like three out of five of my sexy parts after I had kids. Destroyed. (groans) Bad Hair Day. Whoa! Go wash the bathroom floor! What? No! I don't... Go wash it! We never wash floors! You scrub it! (scoffs) Play at the reunion. (scoffs) Who wants to be in a band anyway? Like I need to be laughed off the stage again.  No, thank you  No, thank you!  God, I sound good! Nobody sounds good in the shower!  I'm a Ta-Ta and I'm gonna rock ya  I'm singing from the heart  I still got two out of five, I still got two out of five  I still got two out of five sexy parts! Whoo!  Can you believe we laughed at her at the talent show? We must be idiots. They were all idiots! I'll show 'em! Bob, I changed my mind. I want to go to the reunion now. Tina: Yeah! Louise: Yeah! (whoops) Bob: Crap! Way to go, Mom! Celebration flush! (toilet flushing) Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Buckle up, kids. Time to get the band back together.  We got Angie on the drums  Yeah, yeah, yeah!  We got Patsy on the bass  Yeah, yeah, yeah!  Nancy on guitar  Yeah, yeah, yeah!  And the last one is your Aunt Gayle  And I know she's gonna say yes  'Cause she always loved this band, and she's my sister!  No. Oh, come on! Why not? Because you never let me sing any of my songs! That's because your songs were all so, uh... (whispers): s*xual. Pardon? And you had a serious speech impediment. I know. I wrote a song about it called "Ge-Ge-Ge-Ge, Ge-Ge-Ge-Ge, Ge-Ge-Ge-Ge, Genitals." Derek Dematopolis will be there. Oh. Derek Dematopolis. Oh, oh. Tina: Who's Derek Dematopolis? Linda: Gayle had a crush on him all through high school. Gayle: He was a Greek god. At least he wasn't a Roman god. Those guys are jerks. Okay, I'll do it if I get to sing one of my songs. Ooh... ooh... ooh... Okay, fine! Yay! The Ta-Ta's are back together! (whoops) Wait. Why are you looking at me like that? What's wrong? Is this a bad idea? No. He likes it. I... I don't know. He's smiling. He looks worried. Gene: He's on board. You, look at me now! We have come too far for you to ruin this. Oh, no. You know what? He just has to poop. I'll do it. (cheering and whooping) Yay, Ta-Ta's! Oh, God. He's going. Everybody stay calm. (yells) Linda: And... one, a two, a three, a four.  And I just want to know...  Gayle: Uh, Linda? When are we going to practice my song? Gayle, I'm singing here! Hello! Yeah, okay, well, maybe I'll sing my song quietly underneath. Ugh. Wow, a real band rehearsal. You guys, we can be groupies! Gene, who's your favorite? Nancy, 'cause she brought guacamole. Mine is Mom, and not 'cause I'm biased. It's just I like her energy. How about you, Louise? Gosh, it's hard to choose. They're all so cool. Uh, Lin? What?! Sorry, it's just, people are complaining. Too bad! You know, they want to know if you guys can maybe try tuning up again. Or... No! ...just play on the beat and just do it right? No! All right. Okay, we're losing customers. Good-bye. And a one, two, three, four, go! Do what? Let's rock! I need my sticks. Are we starting? (groans) Uh, Linda? Linda? What, Gayle? When... (whispering): When are we doing my song? I found my drum sticks. Good. Listen, ladies, we got to blow the roof off of that reunion! So let's stop fooling around and turn this band into a lean, mean, mom-jeans revenge machine! Yeah! Mom jeans! Wait. Mom, now your energy is sounding a little negative. Tina, shush! And a one two, three, four! (band playing loudly) Linda: Yeah! That's it! Yeah! Oh, boy. Linda: Bob! Come on, we're gonna be late for sound check! Bob: Just a minute! What are you wearing? What? It's my rock-and-roll clothes. Are you a rock-and-roll hobo? Ugh, I can't believe we don't get to see this freak show with our own eyes! Yeah, sorry. This is a grown-ups thing. It's rated R for "really boozy" starring me. (laughs) Good one, Mom. Hey, I've got something that'll turn those upside-down smiles back the right way. Me as your babysitter. Yay! Um... Tina, about that... Yeah? (doorbell rings) Hello. Mother, what is she doing here? Uh, Honey, you're a great babysitter for, like, uh, short bursts. You're like a cheetah. Okay, a cheetah. So far, so good. But, uh... but we're gonna be gone a long time tonight, so we need a long-haul sitter. The-the boring, old, long-haul sitter. Sorry, Jen. What? Is this 'cause last time I let Gene eat all the Chunky Chocolate Shim Shams and he threw up in your bed? Yes. And I'd do it again! Bob! Bob: I know! What's going on in there? I can't go. Why? I have a problem. I told you, wipe front to back! No, it's... this. (screaming) Get it out. Get it out. Oh, my God. Dad's nose got a nipple! It's a pimple, and it's hideous. Look at it! It's staring right at me! Look, when I walk to the side of the room, it follows me! Are you guys done? No! Okay, you've had your fun, all of you. It's not fun. It's humiliating. I hate high school! Were you messing with it? No. Oh! Oh, God! (grunting) Ow! Ow! Ow! Maybe a little. God, can a pimple have two heads? I can't go. I can't go outside like this! Try putting masking tape on it. Some silly putty. I did that. Quit stealing my thunder, Bobby. This night isn't about your disgusting zit. It's about me and my big comeback and this jacket. I just want that thing out of my house! Fine, I'll go, but we're stopping to buy more concealer on the way. You're all out. I used a lot. If they ask, Dad, you're an autumn. All right, I'm gonna hit the head. See you in a bit! Linda, you're here. Hello, Debbie. Well, I tried to be a good organizer, I did, but I-I... yeah, I couldn't get Bad Hair Day. Da-da-da. You're not gonna regret this, Debbie! No. I mean, I think I will, but...  'Cause we're here to rock!  I'm gonna be like Carrie up on the stage!  But hopefully less blood. (laughs) Um, did you say "Carrie"? Yep.  Bye, Debbie.  I'll see you inside!  (whoops) "Pat lightly with finger to blend." Whoa! (laughs) Hello, handsome. Jen: I spy with my little eye something brown. Is it a babysitter who stabbed a fellow babysitter in the back? Huh? Huh? Is it? Uh, no. It's the couch. Oh. Yeah, that is brown. Um, uh, I'm gonna go... check the pantry, not look for Shim Shams. Bye. Come on! We should be at the reunion! Watching the train wreck of all train wrecks! Come on, Jen, buddy, you got a car, right? You got a license. You like adventure, huh? You want to please us, right, huh? What do you say we drop in? Just one quick drink, we're out of there. Oh, Jen, think how many things you could spy at that reunion. Green things, purple things, bright things, dark things! Come on, Jen! I spy reunions! Um, I'm really trying to honor your mom's instructions. "I'm really trying to honor your mom's instructions." (whispering): I'm mocking you. Listen, whatever she's paying you, I'll double it, then divide it by ten. No, no, 20. No. Where are the Shim Shams, Jen?! I know you're hiding them! Tell me! (mutters) (goofy, high-pitched yelling) Whoa. Sorry, I'm... extremely ticklish. I'll say. Interesting. Hi. Derek Dematopolis. Oh. Hi. Uh, Bob Belcher, Linda's husband. Your, uh, nose is about to fall into your drink there. What? Is that makeup? No. Uh... yeah, it is. Thanks. Sorry about that. It's, uh, makeup. Wow, you've got quite a pimple there. Yeah, it's pretty bad. Whoa, whoa, what are you doing? It's okay. I'm a dermatologist. Derek Dematopolis, the dermatologist? Yup. Wow. That is, uh... What? That is really... Well, it's throbbing. Yeah, it's been really bad for... Yeah. Does it hurt when I do this? Ow! Yeah, it does. That hurts a lot. Did it hurt? Yeah. You know, Stacy works at a spa. Hey, Stacy! Oh, no, no, I don't want to make a big thing... Stacy! Ugh! Hello. Oh, my God, look at that. Yeah. (whistles) Huh? Yeah. (laughs) That's my pimple. Phew! Bet you'd love to get a whack at that thing. Ho, ho! You know who should see this, though, is Tonya. Bob: No. She might have some samples. No, come on. She's-she's in pharmaceuticals. Yeah. She's got the good stuff. Tonya? Yeah. Oh, my God. Get over here. Get a load of this! Tonya. Tonya! Did-did all of you get jobs in skin care?! No, I do hair plugs. Here's my card. Thank you. Okay, guys. This is how we're gonna get to the reunion. I don't know. She seems really ticklish. It's weird. At least she didn't fart. When I get tickled, I fart, but that's me. Tina, the girl took your job! Make her armpits regret it for the rest of their lives! Hey, Jen. Hi. Hey, Louise. Do you want to do something? I have pencils in my purse. Oh, wow. That's fun. You know, we do want to do something. Okay. We want you to drive us to the reunion, Jen. And if you don't, you're gonna get the human feather duster. That's me. Uh... And you're also gonna tell us where the cookies are! And you're gonna let me eat them all and throw up wherever I want! Aah! You probably shouldn't tickle me. Oh, playing hardball, huh? Tina, give her a little taste. Oh, really, guys. (screams) Aah! Aah! Aah! Uh-oh. Hello, alumni of Cardinal Gennaro High. I hope everyone's having a good time, and if you're not, I'd like to see you organize something on this budget, in this time frame. It's been really hard. All right, we're about to go on, so, set list. We'll start with "We're the Ta-Ta's" and then we'll go right into "You Were All Wrong About Us" and then "Oh, Boy, You All Got So Fat." And then my song? Yeah, yeah, yeah, if we have time. Everybody ready? Feel pumped? Do you feel pumped? I feel bloated. Good... use it. So, yeah, divorce is hard. But you know what? You get up in the morning and you... what? (gasps) Oh, my goodness. Recent developments to announce. We thought they couldn't come, but they're here... our very own Bad Hair Day! What? Gah! We're back where we started. It's like the talent show all over again, huh? First place... took home the gold. And then our next gold was a gold record!  Have a PhD in rock and roll...  (sighing) (muttering) So, they're gonna go on first 'cause they've got a packed stadium show to get to, and then you can follow them. That sound good? First the famous girl band, then you guys. (muttering) Great. BHD! BHD! Linda, come on, get into it. (growling) BHD, BH... Ow, ow, ow.  My family is my guitar...  So, just hold this pad here? Oh, wait, let me take a "before" picture. I want to show someone at work. Oh, no, no, no... Got it. Ah, okay. Oh, my God, what's that? I should go check on that thing I just saw. Hey, hey, where you going, where you going, where you going? Hey, hey, to Bob's pimple. Both: To Bob's pimple! Hey, what are we toasting over here? Oh, my God.  'Cause we won the talent show...    (groans) Hey, Linda, about my song... Not now, Gayle. Do you know how to juggle fire? What if, while I'm singing, I throw you a torch? Oh, will you shut up about your stupid song? Your song's out. We're not doing it. What? You said I could sing it. Yeah, well, that was before B-Bad Hair Day showed up. Your song would just make it worse. (gasps) My cat was right about you. This reunion's made you nuts. I quit. Oh, fine, quit. I'm gonna go fill my purse with food and then write some graffiti about you in the bathroom and then wait in the car for you to give me a ride home. Jen: This is bad. Babysitters aren't supposed to give kids black eyes unless... Yeah, no, they're... No, no, no, they're not. I'm going to get fired. What'll I do? You'll probably have to leave town, work on a shrimp boat, call yourself JJ. Whoa, whoa, whoa. No one has to know about this if you take us to the reunion. But won't your parents see the black eye? Hmm, all right, there's only one solution. We all have to have black eyes. Jen has a black eye. Tina has a black eye. Gene has a black eye. I have a black eye. Who did it? Nobody knows. "How'd you get your black eye?" "I don't know." "How-How'd you get your black eye?" "What, do I have one?" "Yeah." Oh, my God, what happened? I guess a black eye fairy came and kissed us all on the eye. Wait, what? But if Jen gets in trouble, I get to be babysitter again. I'm back, baby. No, no, no, Tina, Tina, we need leverage here. (sobbing) (sighs) Damn this big heart of mine. I guess Jen shouldn't get fired. Well, then it's time for some punch! (cheering) Thank you, little people! We're not gonna stay and mingle! Good night! Whoo! Good luck, Tay-tas. Ta-Ta's! Right, right, right. Give it up for Bad Hair Day. How can you top that? You can't. And next up, the Ta-Ta's. Linda, come on. Gah, dah, gah. Yeah, Ta-Ta's, whoo! Oh... drunk. Linda. Patsy: You should go out there. Linda. Get out there. Come on, Lin, rock and roll! Uh... (stammering) (laughter) (stammering) Uh, be right back. (stammering) Linda, are you okay? I'm fine, I'm fine. All right, uh, DJ? Get out here, pizza face. Uh, no, thanks. Ah, get out here. No, I can't, I-I should check on my wife. Come on, it's your night. Ha-ha, it's not really. Ha, nah, I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to the pimple. Okay. (high-pitched): "Okay, I'm coming." (sobbing) All: Go, pimple, go, pimple, go, pimple. (sobbing) That stupid... nothing... Uh, Jen, we're gonna need to hang a little U-ey. (sobbing hysterically) Hello, Mother, we'd like to give you a ride, but you look crazy. What? Where are you going and, and what happened to you? We all got punched, no one knows how, life's funny that way. The end. I still don't get our plan. Shush, Tina. Gah! Anyway, Mom, where are you going? Yeah, what happened with the band? Oh, it was a disaster. Bad Dah Dah came and played and blew everyone away. (groans) We would have been laughed off the stage just like back then. So you left? Yeah. You're a runaway Ta-Ta? Yeah... You look like you could use some Shim Sham crumbs. Here you go. Oh, oh, that's good, it makes... it's good. Linda. Linda, listen. Huh? Linda, listen. Wha...? Huh, what? Linda. What, Jen? Your band is probably bad, but I don't let it bother me that I'm not a good babysitter. I have no chemistry with children, I don't know how to use a "mick-rowave," I don't know what "bath time" means, but I do it 'cause I love it. Maybe you should think about that. Ah... Whoo-hoo-hoo! Derek, I'm reeling you in, buddy! (Derek and Bob laughing) It's a fish! Linda! What? Why are the kids here? Do they all have black eyes? It's babysitter stuff, Dad, get over it. Yeah, it's above your pay grade. Uh, okay, I want to come back to that 'cause none of what you just said makes sense, but first I want to talk to your mother. Lin, I know you're nervous about going up there. I-I was nervous about my pimple, but I was brave and I came here anyway, and I'm having the time of my life, so... Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. I already got the inspirational speech from Jen. Okay? That's all right, I'm fine. Oh, all right, well, I'm gonna go back with my friends, then. Hello, hey, everybody, uh, sorry for the delay. So we're gonna play for you, and, uh, not all those songs I wrote about how fat your butts got because this shouldn't be about revenge. It should be about having fun. Sure, we might suck. We might be total crap, right, girls? Band: Uh... But that's okay. We're doing it 'cause we love it. Whoo. And, uh, hey, uh... shush, shush... listen, I got something else to say. Back when this was just for fun, when it was just us girls, there was someone who I loved to sing with more than anyone else, and that's my sister Gayle. Hmm? I'm sorry. I'm sorry to all you guys. This Ta-Ta has been a real boob. So, uh, our first song is by Gayle. Let's hear it for her... Gayle! (gasps) Really? Yes. Oh, God, Linda, thank you so mu... My song, I get to do my s... Gayle, get up here quick while I got 'em warmed up. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Okay, okay, okay. Here I come, aah. Let's go.  Derek Dematopolis  Your neck hair makes me weak Hey, that's you.  Yeah. (grunts)  Won't you enter my Acropolis  And make my yogurt Greek?  Ooh, that's... Hmm.  Derek  Derek  Let's you and me make a we-union  Derek, Derek  Let's you and me make a we-union  Linda and Gayle:  Tonight...  I-I  Tonigh...  I...  I...  ...ight...  ...ight  Tonight...  Night...  I-I...  Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah  Tonigh...  I-I-I-I-I-I-I...  (vocalizing)  Night  Gayle (whispering):  Tonight. (sobbing): Yes! Yes...! Wow. Oh, thank you. Angie, hit it.  I still got my sexy parts  Well, I got two out of five  I still got two out of five...  Linda: Bye, Jen. Bye, girls. Oh, that was fun. (chuckles, whoops) Oh, Bob, your zit. I know, best pimple ever. Okay, if you think that thing is coming home with us, you're crazy. I hope it never leaves! No, I have to pop it for my sanity. Sit back down. Don't... get off me. Hold his face. I'm gonna give it a black eye! Gene, get your hands off me. I'm gonna go left and put pressure on the left side! Don't touch it! Tina, pressure on the right side. Get your hands off me! Hold his face, hold it tight! Ooh, it's so weird! One, two, three! (all grunt) BOB: Why am I all wet? Gene: Oh, my God. Bob: Why am I all wet? Tina: I'm sorry, Dad. Bob: Lin, pull over, pull over. Linda: Ah, quit being such a baby, Bob, and wipe the windshield... it's gross. (Bob groans) I wonder what happened to Gayle. I guess she got a ride. (both moaning) Ow, ow, ow, you're pulling on my neck hair. It's mine now. (both laugh lasciviously)  This is down here but it should be up there  This is kinda loose and I think it might tear  This is lumpy  And it's dumpy  This is saggy  And it's flabby  When I bend down, I pee a little bit  But it's not bad  Not bad for havin' three kids  Or three cats. These are the ones from the song. The song's about them... my kids.  Not bad for havin' three kids  Drum, pop, drum, pop  Not bad for havin' three kids. 
Louise: Ugh, even stripes don't help. His body's an enigma. Do they make an apron with a control top? I think you look pretty, Dad. Stop it. I just want a plain white one. You can't wear white. You're not a virgin. Gene. Hey, there's Mr. Frond. Oh, hello, Belcher family. Classy martini set. The name's Frond. James Frond. I've got a license to... counsel. Double-oh-so-sad. Louise, be nice. Why? It's Mr. Frond. Ah, Tina, since I caught you, your Home Ec teacher Mrs. Woods is going on disability. O-M-G. Is she okay? Obviously, I can't share confidential details. All I can say is, she's a drug addict. So, until she comes back, we're folding Home Ec in with Metal Shop. Metal Shop? Say good-bye to your fingers. You can build metal fingers. Boy, it's a shame to cancel Home Ec. I mean, everybody needs to learn how to cook, right? A lot of kids aren't lucky enough to grow up in a restaurant. Oh! So that's what you tell yourself. Well, Bob, maybe you'd like to fill in as a substitute, huh? Me, teach? Wow, I mean, I can't. I-I've got the restaurant to run. But... it is an honor to pass on what you know to the next generation, right? I mean, I might even change some lives. What's wrong with Dad? Frond is right! I can teach kids! Mmm... I did it with you, Gene. (blows raspberry) What the hell, let's do it. Wow, this will be great. I've never been teacher's pet before. But now I have a huge head start because Dad already likes me. Like is a strong word. Teacher's pet, the gold star of gold stars. (jazzy music playing) (applause) Mmm... Ahh... What are you doing, Tina? Nothing. You'll see. Well, here I am, all set for my first day. Oh, my God. You look so handsome! Just like Richard Dreyfuss in Mr. Holland's Old pen1s. Um... Why are you carrying Mom's old purse? Oh. I-I thought it kind of looked like a briefcase. Go ahead and use it. But let me take out my pepper spray. Unless you want to cook with it. (chuckles) If it's anything like butter spray, I'm in! Guys, remember, at school, I'm Mr. Belcher, so treat me like you would any other substitute teacher. That means you get a mean nickname and we assume you live a horribly depressing life. In this case, we know it's true. Bob, you're getting a nickname! Fun! Mr. Belt-Stretcher. Ha! Gene: Mr. Bowel-Chair. No, Dr. Fart! Alphonso Poo Poo Fatty III. Those are kind of all not very good. Hmm, Bowel-Chair, pretty good. All right, let's go to school. Let me try a squirt of that pepper spray. (screaming) Oh, actually, not so bad. Linda: Aw, what's the matter, Teddy? You're actually chewing your food instead of throwing your head back like a duck. (groans) I got to go to my cousin's wedding this weekend and I'm dreading it. Oh. Is this the cousin you got to second base with? No, that was my second cousin and it was third base. What is it then? There's always dancing at weddings, and I can't dance. You know, Teddy, I could teach you how to dance. I taught myself, and look at me. (tunefully grunting) That is impressive. Right? I don't know. I mean, the wedding's in three days. That's plenty of time. It's maybe's too much time. Can they move it up? (chuckles) I don't think so. They already rented a bounce house. Bounce house? Yeah, pretty shi-shi. (school bell rings) (indistinct chatter) Hello, class. I'm, uh, Mr. Belcher, your substitute. I will be teaching you, but I also look forward to each one of you... whoa... teaching me. Nice purse, Mr. B.! (laughter) It's a... it's a briefcase. Man purse! No, it's not a man purse. Zeke: Purse! Anyway, what have you guys covered so far? Pies? Omelets? Maybe you've tackled a casserole? One time we made popsicles out of juice. And then we made juice by melting popsicles. Oh, wait, that was in science. We don't cook in Home Ec. We watch educational movies. And I do funny commentary. Zeke's really funny. (chuckles) 'Prec. So put in a flick Mr. B. No, no, no. Today, why don't we actually do a little cooking? Cooking's stupid! The only cooking I do is an lndian burn! (cackling) Ah! Zeke, it burns! Gotcha! I'm gonna go get your neck! Zeke! Zeke, let him go. Play the movie! Class: Movie! Movie! Movie! Movie! Movie! Movie! Alphonso Poo Poo Fatty III! Dr. Fart! Alphonso Poo Poo Fatty III! (indistinct shouting) I have pepper spray in my purse, and I will use it! Movies! Movies! Movies! Movies! You're animals! You're all animals! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on in here? Calm down, children. Here's your movie. (sighs)  I'm here to teach you Home Ec  It'll only take a sec Nothing to make fun of yet.  I'm really enjoying it so far. Kids are horrible. Why do we keep making them? Do you need a hug? No. Kind of. No. All ght, Bob, I should have explained. Home Ec isn't for honor students. It's where dumb-dumbs learn to make ice. You know my daughter's in that class, right? Yes, Bob, I do. Okay, but shouldn't we be... challenging these kids? What? Like a fight? I don't want to fight those kids. Maybe the girls, but... No, teaching them. Teaching them how to cook. Bob, the movies mellow them out. (chuckling): It's not like we can slip meds into their milk. Anymore. What? Hmm? I got to go. I g-got lots to do. Wait. Di... But I'm not go... I don't want to go back in there. Frond... (muttering quickly) Teddy: So, what's the easiest step? No steps. If I wanted to see steps, I'd go to a staircase. Right. Everyone's a dancer. You're probably dancing all day long, you don't even know it. There! You just tugged up your pants to cover up your butt crack. Now, that could be a move. Okay, tug and wiggle, tug and wiggle. Right? Tug and wiggle, tug and wiggle. Now let's make your boom-boom jiggle. Come on. (scatting) (scatting) There he is. (gasp) Look at you. Bill Cosby's got nothing on me. Hey, guys. Hey, how was Home Ec? Keep it goin', Teddy. Tina: It was fun. (whispers): Mr. Belcher totally lost control of the class. Dad did great. He broke down and cried quicker than any substitute teacher ever. I didn't cry. Well, the rumor that I started says otherwise. I started a rumor you wear diapers. But so far, no traction. No, I heard that. Yes! Linda: Nah, just quit, Bob. You always have a job at Bob's Burgers. Yeah, that'll cheer him up. No. You know what. I'm not gonna quit on those kids. I just have to find a way to reach them. (panting): Should I still be dancing? I'm having chest pains. Keep goin'! (grunts) Bob: Sorry I was all up in your grill about cooking yesterday. (chuckles) Don't try to be our friend. Um, all right, well, let's fire up Chester the Home Ec-ster Meets Dustin the Dusting Cowboy. Those two are always gettin' into it. Oh, anybody want some microwave popcorn to go with the movie? Whoops, I ripped the bag. (groans) Now we can't have popcorn! Idiot. Hey, everybody, maybe there's another way to make popcorn. He's trying to microwave without a microwave. Mr. B.'s lost it. God, he's lost it! Let's see where he goes with this. Oh, my God! What's happening?! We're cooking, Jocelyn. That's what's happening. What's cooking? Aw, poop, he tricked us! Or, aw, poop, he taught us. It smells like real microwave popcorn. Hey, who wants to make some kettle corn? Me! Me! I do. You rock, Mr. Belcher. All right, Anthony. Down low, too slow. Oh. You got there in time. (sighs). Come on. There's a line? That was a great class, Mr. Belcher. Calm down, kiddo. Sorry, Zeke, I just got carried away. Nah, we're cool and all but just shut up sometimes. Right. Got it. Shut it! Jimmy Jr., shut it! Your dad's really cool. He's married! To a friend of mine! What the heck happened here? I'm not sure. I think Dad might be a great teacher. Your dad rules! Hey, I don't appreciate your lack of sarcasm. (sighs) There's a lot of competition for teacher's pet. It's a real petting zoo in there. Linda: And shake it and shake it and shake it and shake it and... Aw, stop shakin' it. (grunting) Whew. Teddy, I'm gonna be frank, okay? You got the moves but there's no fire. (growls) I got no fire! No, it's okay because weddings have firewater. Firewater? Yes. What is firewater? It's alcohol. Right. Okay. It's been helpin' men dance at weddings since the beginning of time. Come on. You chug-a-lug and cut a rug! Well, I got to fix a roof later but this is important. (guzzling) Attaboy! Will not be the first time I've fallen off a roof. Hi, I was wondering if I could borrow an egg? I'm Bob, the substitute Home Ec teacher. Well, well, well, Mr. Bob the substitute Home Ec teacher comes into my kitchen and wants to borrow a egg. If you don't have one, it's fine. No, let's get you that egg. Oh, thank you. Here it is. That's not an egg. That's your middle finger. If you don't want it sunny-side up, I can make it over easy. Finger upside down, got it. Want to see scrambled? Jeez, it's a little aggressive down here. I mean, aren't we on the same team? We both work for the school. I don't. I work for Caf-Co Food Services. And Caf-Co has a strict policy against lending eggs to Bob. All right, well, I'll find an egg someplace else, I guess. (laughs) Just messing with you. Seriously, I've got a dozen over here on the shelf. (chuckles) Jeez, you really had me going. (chuckling): I know. Fu... That's funny. Here you go. Here you go. (sighs) Uh, I got it. Here you go. Here you go. You got a basket for these? Huh? Yeah, no... I'm all set, thank... Thank you. Thanks for your help. All right. Take care, Bob. Have a nice day. Yeah, you, too. Can you believe that guy? Substitute. Okay, someone taste this soup and tell me what it needs. Oh, look, he chose me. Okay, fine, I'll do it. Um... salt. I know that because I pay attention in class, and I'm not texting like Jocelyn or late like Peter. Uh, someone else? Zeke, you want to try? I don't need this stuff, Mr. B. I ain't goin' to college. Just try it, Zeke. Nope! I can't do it. Well, no... Zeke. No! No one will laugh at you. (groans) All right. Might as well try to Zeke it up, I guess. (slurps) (smacking) Let's see what we got. All right. Uh, let's try some of this leafy stuff. Some of these orange flakes that look like fish food. (sniffing, groans) Forget it, forget it. Let's invite some of thisto the party! Ooh, la, la. Paprika? Eureka! Get your ass in here, girl! (laughing): Oh, man. (mutters) Oh, boy. All right, I probably wrecked it. It's... unbelievable. Shut up. It's amazing. No. Zeke, you may have a perfect palate. Do you know how rare that is? Get out of my mouth, Mr. B.! Stop it! Zeke, you can't run away from your gift! No! No! No! I can teach you! Zeke, don't shut me out! (blowing raspberries) You've got to... You've got give it a... Shut up! Shut up! Go to hell! You've got to give it a chance, Zeke! Go to hell! All right, I'll try it. Just don't start something you can't finish, Mr. B. I won't let you down, Zeke. Anyhow, the soup wasn't perfect. Tina put too much salt in it. Go to hell, Zeke.  La, la  La, la, la, la, la  La, la, la, la, la  La, la  La, la, la, la, la.    (sniffs) Smells great. Yeah, we should eat it right now. Hey, you guys aren't in this class. Please? It smells so good. We'll pay. With our lunch money. You guys, we're not a restaurant. Go away. Well, wait, we could be. No, we're not. Well, that's the "Ec" of "Home Ec." A-a restaurant. Oh. Yeah, a Home Ec-staurant. Jocelyn, you can do your salads. Yay, salad! Peter, you can be our beverage guy. What's a beverage? Jimmy Jr., can you handle the money? I have a calculator. You do the math. And for our head chef, the person who will wield the spatula... Tina? Yes? Can you hand this to Zeke? (dramatic sting) Hell, yes! (grunts) Tina, give it to him. (groaning) Come on, let go. Tina, give him the spatula. Let go, Tina. (grunting) Let go of it, Tina! We want to eat! Let go of it, Tina. Give it to Zeke. Give it to Zeke. Tina! Where are all the food holes? Huh? The rest of the kids. Maybe they're at the Home Ec-staurant? The Home Ec-sta what?! Back up! Home Ec-staurant. Home Ec-sta what?! Aah! I can't breathe. Home Ec-sta what?! Can't breathe! Aah! You're useless! Useless! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Hildy's sorry. Here, take an extra, uh, black and white bar. (indistinct crowd chatter) Yeah, we got a problem. No, it's Hildy. Look at us, we're packed. Yeah, we're busier than a monkey with six dingalings! Order up! Come on, Jocelyn, get your head out of your butt! Oh. How am I doing on dishwashing, Mr. Belcher? Good, Tina. Of course, kids are licking the plates clean, so it's kind of easy, right? No. Yeah, if we're gonna keep up, we need more manpower. No, no, no, no, no! No! no... You don't want me. I'm a terrible employee! Check my references! And Gene's the one who trained me. I didn't even listen. Gene, you're a waiter, Louise, you're hostess. We need to turn some tables! Fine! Hello. How was everything? Guess you didn't like it! Ha, ha, just kidding. So unless there's anything else, maybe you should go now. Ga-up, up, up, up, up, up. Drive safe. Thanks for coming. Come again. I got an open two-top here! Give me a bald Kelly Ripa and a canoe with a brick! Chicken taco, no sour cream, plus a brownie... you got it. Really? I didn't even know what I meant. I think I'm a great waiter! I think I'm a great hostess! Maybe we've always been great. Yeah! And we've just been working in a sucky restaurant. (sighs) I guess I know where I belong. Hi. I want to transfer into Metal Shop. (deep, sinister voice): Come in. Linda: Part of dancing is finding a partner, okay? So go ask that guy to dance. Um... Do it. What if says no? Make him say yes with your body. With my body, right. (laughs): Right, yeah. No, I don't want to dance. What about now? (groaning) Okay. (groaning) Hey, Bob, I made this guy say yes with my body. Great. Enjoying yourself, sir? Yeah, this is all right. Hey, you're home from school early. Well, I'm going back. I'm just grabbing some plates for the second restaurant. What second restaurant? The home ec class. Now it's a home ec-staurant. Lin, this teaching thing is unbelievable. I'm changing kids' lives! Me, too! I feel exactly the same! I changed Teddy's life! Bob: Um, uh, I don't know if we're feeling quite the same thing, Lin. I mean Teddy's one life, and he's old. Not that it's a competition. No, of course not, but, uh... I bet none of your students can do this. Come on, lift that guy up. Lift him up. No, no, no, no, no, no, no! (grunting) See that? (whimpering) I got him up! He's up. I'm gonna spin! Light! Light! Light! Light! Kevin, are those new pants? Cindy, Ray, are you two back together? So happy. Hey, Paul, when's the cast coming off? Stop using those crutches as a crutch. (laughs) David, come here. Sorry about your parents' divorce. It's not your fault. I love you, man. Donald, the rat tail... it's coming back! Okay, I'm going to the bathroom now. I'm going to stop talking. (sighs, liquid pouring, footsteps) Aah! I didn't mean to startle you. Just wanted to check in with the new lunch lady. I-I'm not a lunch lady. You sell lunches to kids, you got a little mustache. Occupied! Well, I-I should probably get back to my classroom. Not so fast. Wash your hands. That's disgusting. Oh, yeah, you kind of threw me off my routine. Wash up. I prefer to do it myself. You got to get in there. Can you not wash my hands? Hotter water. I got to get hotter water on this. You're hurting me. That's really hot. Ow! Oh! Oh, God! Oh, God... Ah. Now that you're all cleaned up, there's someone who wants to talk to you. Get in the back. "Get in the back"? Lift the thing on the side, the seat slides forward. Crawl under the seat belt. I'll hold it up. Okay, um... Hello. I'm Mr. Platt. "Michael Mauermann." Mr. Mauermann retired. My cards aren't ready yet. Trust me, they'll look quite similar. "Caf-Co Food Services." Bob, we have an exclusive contract that you are in violation thereof. Come on, your big corporation has a problem with kids making food for other kids? Definitely. If it's bigger than a bake sale, they call Michael Mauermann, and they reach me because I have his number now, and I shut it down. Well, I was hired by Mr. Frond, so, take it up with him. Oh. I already have. (car door opens) Sorry I'm late. I thought we were meeting in that hatchback over there. Hmm. Bob, could you please...? (scoffs) Make a little room. Could you...? Yeah. Yup. Yes. And I'm not gonna sit on the hump! Can you be polite, Bob? Just move over. Thank you. Thank you. Well, I don't want to sit on your lap, so... Uh... I don't want you to, either. Bob, the administration is siding with Caf-Co. You are to close the Home Ec-staurant, and go back to movies, or you're fired. No. I-I won't do it to the kids. Then out you go! (grunting) What are you doing? Open the door so I can push him out, Mr. Frond. Can you not do that? I mean, I can just curl up in the seat here and let him go by. Well, if you would shimmy forward, now, now... You know, all you need to do is move. You're pushing my neck. I-I want to push you out. You're... Stop pushing me. I'll just get out. And here it comes. Got you. Ha, ha! No, you didn't. Well, yes, I did. I pushed you out, and you're fired. So, double burn on you. I got out on my own. Well, then, uh... you're rehired. Get back in the car. No. I'm not falling for that. No, just... just sit down on the edge of the seat here. No, I'm walking away now. Thank you. You... (goofy singing) Now you. Not bad, Lin, but what about...  Baba, bada, ba-ba, ba-bada-bup.  Yeah, that's okay, Teddy, for people who can't do this, and thisand that and thatand that! Maybe you were thinking of this! Ooh, ah, ooh-ooh, ah! Ow, my face! Oh, my God, Lin! (groaning) Aah! This was a bad idea. I should never dance. I should never dance! No, Teddy. This is what dancing's all about. Not holding back, taking chances! Yeah, sometimes people get hit in the mouth. So what? You're not... you're not mad? Mad? Teddy, I'm as proud as can be. I got nothing more to teach you. The only thing left to do now is... Kiss? No! What? No! Dance. Dance out that door. It's your graduation.  Teddy knows how to dance now  He is ready for the wedding.  Come on, get out the door, move it.  Get out of the restaurant  Aah!  I want you to leave now.   Ah, ooh-ooh, ah!  When your underpants are streaky and your socks  Are smelling freaky, get some bleach.  (groans) Oh, uh, sorry. I, uh... I just need to get a couple things. (gasps) It's Mr. B! Save us, please! We don't want to watch movies, Mr. Belcher! We want you! Yeah, we want to, like, cook stuff! We miss you. Look, kids, I'm sorry. This-this wasn't my idea. I... Come on, Mr. Belcher, you got to stay. Come on! Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay, okay, children, children. Okay, everyone, hush. Watch the movie. Wait. Mr. B. (gasps) Stop it! That's a huge waste of popcorn. (bags tearing) Get out, Bob! Caf-Co won. You're done. Meat is done, not people! I just felt a little tingly there when you said that. Listen, we can't win this war, but maybe we can go out cooking. What if we serve this school one more lunch? The Home Ec-staurant is closed! Everyone's already down in the cafeteria anyway. It's over. Yeah, they are, so we go to them. Let's get this chow-wagon rollin' to Mouth Town, everyone! I'm telling Mr. Platt. What do we make, Mr. Belcher? Burgers! Burgers, really? Wait. That... We don't want burgers? No! No, no, no! That's good. That's fine. I thought burg... Okay, well, we could... No, sounds like you're married to burgers, so... Burgers! Thought I heard "braised lamb shank" is all. Gene: Great, after I bought all those gift certificates! Well, I can't go back to my old job. I burned a lot of bridges there! To the cafeteria! Gene, Louise, hop on! Louise: Okay. Gene: All right. It's the mobile Home Ec-staurant. Tina, how are we fixed on dishes? Tina? Where's Tina? She transferred to Metal Shop, because her home ec teacher was treating her like day-old bread. Tina transferred? Oh, my God, I-I didn't even realize she was gone. Wait. Everybody stop. Which way is Metal Shop? (metallic clinking, whirring) Look, I welded a piece of metal to a piece of metal. Hi. I'm Tina. Tina! Hello, Mr. Belcher. What are you doing here? Really cool things with metal. At least I'm teacher's pet somewhere. No, that's Jeremy. Oh. Tina, I'm sorry I didn't pay enough attention to you. I-I've never taught a class before. I didn't know how to treat my own kid. I wanted to be your favorite student, not Zeke. But you're already my favorite... eldest daughter. I can't do anything right! Come with us, Tina. We're gonna serve one last lunch, and we need you. To wash dishes? Yes! But you can also do prep. Okay. Bye, everyone. Bye, Jeremy. (Tina panting) There they are. Nice try, Bob, but your little food cart escapade is over. Don't listen to him, kids. Keep pushing. We need speed. Gene, get off. I just got comfortable. Get off your cushion, and do some pushin'! (Gene grunting) Stop! Ramming speed! Oh, goodness, I am jumping out of the way. Aah! (clinking) Oh, God, it's collapsing. I have something we can use... metal. The Home Ec-staurant is back in business. Louise: Come and get it, Wagstaff! (cheering and whoopi We got burgers! And tomatoes and onions that I chopped, because I'm in charge of prep. Joceyln's doing it, too, but I'm more in charge than her. No, you're not. Yeah, he said that I was. Mr. Platt: No. No, don't eat that! Eat that! We need that money! You... You, stop chewing! Hildy, get that food out of his mouth! All of you, eat the cafeteria lunch! Ah... forget it. Hildy, let's go get drunk. What do you mean, "Get drunk"? Yay! We did it, Mr. B! This will always be remembered, till people forget. By the way, you guys are all getting an A. (gasps) Oh, yeah! Yeahh Except for Tina. Yay...! Oh. A plus. Thanks, Mr. Belcher. It's a pass-fail class. Oh, okay. Uh, pass plus. Hey, you want to take a break and get something to eat? Belcher party of two, your server will be right with you. Hi. How's, uh, everybody's day so far? Getting better. Fantastic. I'll be back with some waters and tell you about our specials. I could really use someone like him back at the restaurant. Ooh, ah. Ooh, ah. I'm dancing so high! I'm dancing so high! Someone get in here with me! Someone get in... Oh. Oh, God. Oh, no. (retches) (zippering) Do not come in here! Nobody come in here. Someone threw up in the bounce house. Kids, kids, kids, you can't go in the bounce house. Someone threw up in there. I don't know. I don't what happened. I don't know what... Who wants to dance?
 Hang the ball and the ball goes over there  And this goes over there  And da-da-da-da-da...  Oh, everybody, look at the tree. Aw, I love this tree. It's the day after Halloween, Lin. Don't you think we might have gotten the tree a little early? Oh, put some mistletoe on my butt and kiss it, Bobby. Okay. Yeah, Dad. Stop ruining Halloween by not celebrating Christmas. Aw... bye, tree. You had a good life. That's how I want to go out, dehydrated and covered in tinsel. Sounds like a gay pride parade. Mm-hmm. Everybody, look at the tree. Aw, I love our new tree. Look. (laughs) It's the day after Thanksgiving, Lin. I'm not looking at it till tomorrow. It seems like just yesterday it was Thanksgiving. Oh, my God. It's Christmas Eve and our tree is dead. What are we gonna do, Bobby? I don't know, but we have to get this out of the house; It caught on fire twice. I guess we're just not going to have a tree on Christmas this year. What?! Not-not-not-not-not have a tree on... on Christmas?! Where are the presents gonna go if there's no tree? We want a divorce! Thank you, bye. Everyone just calm down, okay? There is a tree lot about an hour away. And the guy said we could have the pick of the runts! Right? Lin, you want to drive an hour away and get another tree? What-what about our Christmas Eve dinner? I have a ham in the oven. You have to fart? No, Tina. A real ham is currently in our oven. Just bring it. Everyone loves rare ham. No, Gene. Bob, put the oven on low. We'll be back before you can say Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, and Nixon. Well, we'd better be back fast. Tonight's the night we finally catch Santa Claus. We've been planning this for months. You're gonna catch Santa? Yup. We built a Santa trap. All right, but if you catch him, he's your responsibility. I'm not cleaning up after Santa. Dj: Hey, this is David Dazzle, I'll be your pilot for tonight. I'm playing all your Christmas's favorites and some songs no one likes. Family road trip! (whoops) We're going to get a Christmas tree, all right! Again. Oh, Bobby. Stop being such a lump of coal. This is what the holidays are all about. We're together, there's Christmas music on the radio. Oh, give me the phone! I want to request "Jingle in the Jungle." "Jingle in the Jungle"? That sounds like a terrible Christmas song. Maybe you're not ready. "Jingle in the Jungle" pushes the limits. Step on it, Dad! We have a date with a fat old man. We're chubby chasers. Tina, that's... Don't say that, that's not ni-nice to say. Fat fetishists? Kids, tickle your father. He's being a big bah hum-booger! Get him. No, don't... Get him! Get him! Don't tickle me now, I'm driving. No, kids...  I'm gonna tickle your mustache  All right, kids, cut it out!  I'm gonna tickle your mustache.  I-I got armpits! Armpits! Hey, hey, hey, I'm driving! You don't tickle the driver! Oh! You're not driving very well. Bob: Whose hand is that? I can't see. Gene: I just want to use the windshield wipers for a second. Bob: Lin, get the kids off me! Linda: It's Christmas! Bob: Are these even Christmas trees? Aw. They're all so skinny and sick-looking. Can you turn that one around, please? Mom wants to see its tree butt. Everybody's got their thing. I'm more of a branch man. Mmm. Okay, well, you guys decide on which scrawny tree to buy. We're going to go over there and practice our Santa containment strategies. I assume he knows jujitsu... Uh, can I come? Your mom's gonna be at least another half hour here. Uh, you're not part of the plan, Dad. Well, I could help. I'm bigger than you. Yeah, but you're weak. Santa would drop you. And that would k*ll me. I could take Santa. Okay, Dad. Hey, Tina, thanks for helping Louise beat up Santa. She really believes... she can catch him. Yeah. It's so nice that she still believes... in this mission. It's weird, right? Isn't nine a little old to, uh... believe that? To what... Believe what? That... What... um... In the mission? (stammers) Okay. Forget it. Never mind. Good talking to you. Good talking to you, Dad. Finally, a truck you're allowed to lick. Louise: Gene! Focus! Okay, let's go through this again. We'll pretend the Porta Potti is the tree and Santa's on his way to deliver presents. Gene, you be Santa. Phase one. Santa passes right by the kitchen where he sees cookies! These rocks are the cookies. Num num num num num. Phase two. Santa finds a note that says "Milk in the fridge." I'm thirsty! Phase three! When he opens the fridge and grabs the glass of milk... Bam! His wrist is stuck in a zip tie! Aah! That's when I jump out and wrap myself around his ankles. (grunts) Then Tina jumps on his back and makes Kringle crumble. Aah! I'll gouge out his eyes and pull on his beard! Aah! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. We want him alive, T. Sorry, I got carried away. I'm glad we practiced. Bob: Kids, help me out. I can't see. Am I good? Yeah, you're good. You're very good. (horn honks) I thought you said I was good! How could you guys not see that giant candy cane truck? We see it. We just don't make a big deal out of it. (horn blaring) Great, I'm not getting traction. I thought we were gonna get snow tires. That was gonna be my Christmas present to you. Aw... Because I wasn't expecting to be out in the snow, buying a Christmas tree the night before Christmas. (horn blares) Hey! Jackass! We're having a Christmas moment here, all right? Lin, just stop. Bob, let me handle this. (honking to tune)  Jing-le bells  Jing-le bells  Jin-gle all the way Lin. What?  I'm doing "Jingle Bells." (honking) He's just hearing honking. Now, stop. Come on, kids. Sing along! (honking to tune)  Jing-le bells  Jing-le all the way  Gene:  Jingle all the bells  Louise: Jingle, jingle, jingle. Linda: Ooh, there we go. Bob: Everybody stop jingling. How long does the normal person stay on hold? Four hours? Oh, great. This guy again. I guess he's not in a hurry anymore. Maybe the speed limit is seven. You know, I'm gonna pass him. You can't be serious. Is he speeding up? What's this guy's problem? Linda: So... you guys excited to decorate the tree? I don't know if we should put any ornaments on it, Mom. It looked pretty fragile. What? Gene: Yeah, somebody give that tree a sandwich! And a bowl of soup. Oh, my God. Aw, be nice to the tree. Louise: It is December, Mom. Shouldn't you be decorating for the Fourth of July? Stop speeding up! Let me in! Bob, who you talking to? (horn blares, screaming) Oh, my God! That was close! You almost drove us right into that snow plow, Bobby! Good thing you don't have any children in the backseat. It wasn't my fault! That trucker is driving like a lunatic. More like you are. No. It was him. I just want to get away from him. Now he's right on my ass. This guy's trying to k*ll us! I'm gonna pull off the road right there. (tires screeching) (screaming) Yes! (tires screeching) (screaming) Linda: Oh, my God, I'm gonna puke! (gagging) Huh... is everybody okay? I'm fine. I'm great! I didn't pee my pants. Good, Gene. Why wasn't I scared? Wait, that was terrifying. Now I have to pee! Okay, uh.... just go pee outside. No! It will freeze up and go up inside my body! What the hell was that, Bobby? You trying to get us k*lled? Me? That trucker just ran us off the road, Lin! Gene: The pee is winning. Gene, just hold it. Okay, so every time somebody tailgates you, you drive off the road? That wasn't tailgating, that was intimidation! By an adorable candy cane truck. Urination begins in three, two... Gene, Gene. We'll take you to pee in that diner. Hurry up. We need to get back on the road. It might take a minute. My bladder asked if my colon could come out and play, and my colon was like, "Sure thing." (gasps) Oh, Bobby! They make Dutch Babies here! Let's order one! What's a Dutch Baby? About $2,000 less than an American baby? No, it's their world-famous high-rise pancake. It says it takes 25 minutes to make We don't have time. I have a ham in the oven, remember? Just fart, Dad. It's okay. Tina, stop. You almost ran our family off the road, remember? We're getting a Dutch Baby for dessert. We'll get it to go. Dutch Baby, please. But the ham will dry out. You could call Teddy. He's got a spare key. I bet you he'd turn off the oven. Sure thing, Bobby. I was gonna watch church on TV but I can just DVR it. Well, we just need you to turn off the oven. That's all, Teddy. Ooh. Uh... I'm not really much of a cook. I don't spend a lot of time in the kitchen. (sighs) As you probably know. It's not hard, Teddy. You just turn the knob... Whoa, whoa. Slow down, Bob. Let me get a pen. You don't need a pen, Teddy. Hold on, hold on, hold on. You just need to turn the knob to "off." Turn the knob to...? Go. Off. Off. Okay. O-F... Oh, my God. This thing's not working. Why is it you always... you never have one that works when you... Hold on. Just go to our house and turn off the oven! Okay. Bob, did you get my Christmas card? Teddy, I gotta go. Bobby, did you get the Christmas card? Not yet. Can't wait. Not everyone got 'em. Bye! Oh, they got a pecan pie. Should we get a pie while we wait? Do I look different? I feel different. Whoo... ha... Phone. Gimme the phone. Why? I want to get back on hold. It's the only place I know who I am anymore. Hmm. Uh, excuse me, Officer. Hi. Over here. Uh, yes. Um... I would like to report a crime. I was just run off the road by a truck shaped like a giant candy cane. Do you want to maybe write that down or call it in? Hello? Are you injured in any way? Um... no. Was there any damage to your vehicle? No. So, what, was he mean to you? A truck driver was mean to you? Oh, snap! Louise, stop. Why do they call you "the fuzz"? Is it because of your head? Gene. Sorry, don't listen to them, Officer. But maybe listen to me? Because it doesn't seem like you're doing that. Sir, I am trying to enjoy my Dutch Baby. Looks good. Listen, there's a very dangerous man out there driving around in a huge candy cane. I'm gonna need you to slide back down into your booth. Officer, you just gotta listen to me! Sorry about that. Did you just hit that waitress? No. Yes, you did. I mean, yes, I did, but it was a mistake. Why would you hit someone on Christmas? It's 'cause this guy wasn't listening to me. Well, maybe if you slap more waitresses, I'll get right on it. Fine. Linda, kids. We're leaving. No more Dutch Babies! No! I think that's a good idea. Let's go. My Baby hasn't been delivered yet. Lin, come on! Oh, look, it came out in 22 minutes! Oh, it's a preemie just like Jesus. Teddy: Hello? Anybody home? I know there's not, but I have manners. Mmm. That ham smells good. Wish my place smelled this hammy. Bob's really got it all. Oh, it's just a dial. Why did Bob make it so complicated? Hey, there's my Christmas card. Bob didn't open it. What's he waiting for, actual Christmas? Hello, cookies. I'll accept a tip. Tree or a reindeer? Ah, they probably taste the same. Or maybe they don't. Maybe I find out. Who knows? I need some milk. Mmm. "The milk is in the fridge." Okay. "To reach milk, place your hand through Christmas wrist wreath." That sounds fun. Oh! Oh! (grunting) What's going on?! Aah! Oh! Oh, man! (grunting) Ooh, pickles. Linda: Ah, hope you're happy, Bobby. You almost got this family arrested. You know, the only reason we're even driving around on Christmas Eve, Lin, is because you bought a tree on November 1! (scoffs) Your negative attitude is what probably k*lled our tree. Both of you, shush! We got to get home! Santa's not gonna kidnap himself. It's the one thing he can't do. Oh, my God. Is that him? It's the candy cane truck! Oh, here we go. Bob and his truck, everybody. (engine revs) Why is he in the middle of the road? Why is he coming so fast? Bobby! Bobby! (all screaming) Oh, my God! Bob, that candy cane truck is trying to k*ll us! That's what I've been saying! We don't listen to you! Oh, my Dutch Baby! Get it out from under the pedals, Lin! You're mushing it, Bobby! You're k*ll*ing her! So you believe me now? Oh, I'm so sorry I doubted you, Bobby. I thought it was like that time you said you flushed but I know you didn't. I flushed. I saw what I saw! I still see it when I close my eyes. Look, we don't have time for this. We have to call the police. Gene, give your mom the phone! I can't. I'm on hold with the radio station! You've been on hold with them this whole time? "Jingle in the Jungle" is an American classic. You'll thank me when you hear it. Give her the phone! The battery's dead! Damn it, Gene! All batteries die, but this one truly lived. Hang on, everybody! Whoa! (all yell) What are you doing?! I thought the car would spin all the way around like in the movies! Oh, we can't shake this guy! I'm gonna go down that little road. (tires screech)   (truck beeping) Bobby, do something. He's coming back! This guy's crazy! I'll pull the car in there and shut off the lights. Maybe he won't see us in the trees. Everybody stay still and be very quiet. Can I just say one thing? No, Gene. I think I have the best legs in the family. And the smoothest bottom. Okay, no more talking. Mom? Dad? Oh, my God. I just wanted to let you know. I was the one who didn't flush. It's okay, sweetheart. That was impressive though. It looked just like your father's. That's what I was going for. Can everybody just please stop talking? Now I know what the Von Trapps felt like. Dad? What? Where do babies come from? You all come from my v*g1n*. I knew it. You owe me ten dollars, Tina. Everybody stop. He's right there. He's right there. Tina: Can he see us? Bob: I don't know. (truck beeping) I think he's leaving. He's gone. Yay! All right. Yes! Nobody is saying it so I'll just say it. I saved all of our lives. Merry Christmas. Come on, let's go home! We're gonna... time to do the tree. Oh, no. No! No! No! What? What happened? What happened? No, no, no, no, no! We're stuck. Nobody's saying it so I'll just say it. Dad ruined Christmas. (humming a tune) It's like a disco. (continues humming) (all groaning) It's working! Oh, God! Aah! Come on, come on, we can do it. We couldn't do it. I told you we should drive a motorcycle with four side cars. Then we would never be in this mess! What are we gonna do, Bobby? We got to get out of here. I nominate Tina to walk for help. Just to be nominated is an honor. Don't worry. We'll figure something out. We're not missing Christmas. I promise. Dj: Hey look at that, it's just past midnight. Merry Christmas, everyone. Merry Christmas, Radio DJ. Hey, no one's called in for this one tonight, but I'm playing it anyway. Here's "Jingle in the Jungle." Yay! Christmas miracle! Bob: I wasn't expecting so much bongo. I like it. You know what? Who needs a nice cozy, warm, comfortable home? We can have our own Christmas right here in the car. Yeah, until it runs out of gas and we freeze to d*ath. Yeah. It's like we're a family of cops, staking out that bush. That's a dumb place to keep bowls. And all was right with the world, and... Ah! Look what the wise men bought from the auto parts store. Let's all sing "Silent Night." (clears throat)  Silent  Night  Holy...  Crap! Truck! Bobby, we got to get out of here! It's still not working! Okay, everybody just stay calm. We're safe here in the car. I have a plan... let's all get out of the car and run in different directions. He'll only catch the slowest one. Gene, you're the slowest one! Aah! I'm the slowest one! Kids, no, get back here! Maybe it's a different candy cane truck? Bob: Oh, my God. This is it. We're trapped. Kids, get in the car now. Lock the doors. Oh, thank God. Dad's on it. The handler's got it covered, guys! Relax! Bob, be careful. Tell him you had asthma when you were a boy. And you have bad night vision. Listen, uh, sir. Whatever it is you want, we're just trying to get home for Christmas. Can we just talk this out? Oh, you look like that. Um, okay. Uh, you seem like a small, reasonable guy. If this is about earlier, I'm sorry I cut you off. I don't want to point fingers, but it was my kids' fault. Yeah, Dad. Great. For Christmas I really wanted you to throw us under the bus. Let's do this! Me and you. It's go time! Aah! Just take my coat off. Bob (laughs): N-No. I'll fight him, punk! Come on, punk! Lin, stay in the car. Listen, this is crazy. I mean, why are you so angry? Just because I cut you off? You also kept honking at me. Repeatedly. It was "Jingle Bells." You don't know "Jingle Bells"? (stammers) Put 'em up, snowflake. Oh, we're gonna dance. Are you shivering? You should put your jacket back on. Oh, I-I... I'm fine. (shudders) Look, how about this? My car is stuck in the snow. If you can... (shuddering) You're really shivering. (whimpering) If you could just help us pull it out 'cause you have a big truck... I'm about to bang your ass and you're asking me for help? "Bang my ass"? Yeah, bang your ass! Okay, I mean, you mean... Okay. I-I've never heard it said that way. What? Bang? You mean, beat me up. You know, I think I meant kick. I'm pretty... I think I meant kick. It was like halfway out of my mouth and I went, "Ooh, that could be taken the wrong way." Come on! Let's go! Let's go! Well, it... All right, I-I... Look. I'll tell you what, if you pull our car out of the snow, I-I'll-I'll let you punch me in the stomach. Bobby! Psst. You're gonna let this guy hit you? He's just a sad, little guy, Lin. I-I don't think it's gonna hurt. I'll just act like it does. Do your girl scream. What girl scream? I think she means your regular scream. And then do your girl walk. Girl walk? I don't have a girl walk. Yeah, you do this like... (grunting) I don't do that. Mmm, agree to disagree. Look, I think this guy's having a worse Christmas than us. He seems like he really needs this. Aw, that's the holiday spirit, Bobby. (groans) So cold. And crisp. I guess I'm near the crisper. I'm not gonna last much longer... Maybe I can get to the knives on the counter. I could cut my way out. Teddy, you got to try. (grunts) Just pretend you're moving a fridge for Bob. So, Bobby, you got a new fridge, huh? What else is new with you? Uh-oh. No, no, no, no, no, no... (groans) Now I'm gonna die looking at Gene's finger painting. What is that even supposed to be? So, do we have a deal? I want to punch your stupid face! No, just the stomach. How about I kick you in the neck? Look, you get one punch to the stomach, and then you get us out of here. Fine, but I need to borrow your jacket. Look, let's just get this over with. (yells) (sighs) Christmas is just a really hard time for me. I wish I was with my family. Aw, he's not with his family. Poor thing's all alone on Christmas. And then you cut me off, and that was the last straw. That's why I wanted to bang your butt. You... I thought we agreed not to say that. All right. Listen, I-I-I'm sorry I cut you off. And I'm sorry you have to work on Christmas. That's rough. (sighs) Tell me about it. I have to drive through the night to get from a Christmas Eve parade to a Christmas Day parade. Oh, that's an awful lot of driving. And a lot of information. Sounds like you're having a horrible Christmas. Great, we've bonded, can I lick your truck now? Yum. Probably the crappiest Christmas ever. (groans) Guess you just needed someone to take out your frustration on. Exactly! I thought we'd worked past the whole punching thing. Nope. (whoops) Boy that felt good. Man, I really needed that. Hi, my name's Gary. Hey, Gary. Bob. You're pretty strong. Now, let's see if we can get you guys out of here, huh? Hey, how do you know if you have internal bleeding? I can tell. I can tell. Let me listen. Let me listen. All right! Here we go! Thanks, Gary! No problem. I'm gonna get back into my, uh... prison on wheels now. Okay! Aw, you just need a little Christmas cheer in there. Bobby, give him the tree. What? No. The tree is the whole reason we... Give him the tree! All right. That's so nice. Hey, come here. You ever have a Dutch Baby? Put that in your mouth. Merry Christmas. This is really good. You can't even taste the baby. Yeah. Oh, oh, God, he's so hungry, look. (groaning) We got him! Oh my God, Teddy! Teddy is Santa! I found the Christmas card you didn't open. It's right there on the counter. Open the card while I'm here. You'd rather me do that than try and get the... Open the card, then you can get the fridge off of me. Oh, well, anyway, it's just a cat. What does it say? It says "Meow-y Christmas." Yup, yeah. That's cute.  Hoo, ha, hoo, ha  (animal screeching)  Hoo, ha, hoo, ha  Jingle in the jungle, hope you bringle me a bundle  Jingle on my tingle  Santa, bring my favorite thingles  Some mittens for the monkeys  But make sure they're pretty funky  Some leggings for the lion, but remember he's size nine  Frogs and gators and monkeys immense  Everybody jingle to the jungle dance  We have candles and lights and jingle...  © 2013 20TH CENTURY FOX TELEVISION
Linda: (gasps) There he is! Little King Trashmouth. Oh, what's he eating? A coffee filter filled with taco meat? No carbs for him, huh? (laughs) (gasps) Uh-oh. Oh, it's the one I call El Diablo! Like the Devil, yeah. (chittering) One of these days, there's gonna be a rumble between those two. Bob: Lin... Linda: I'm on the phone, Bob! Ginger, I wish you could see. The big one's all mangy and crazy-eyed. He looks like your cousin Cheryl. (laughs) Aw, poor Cheryl. How's her psoriasis? Oh, my God. Lin... Oh, she used to leave a trail of those flakes... Lin, we're kind of trying to eat. Okay, Ginger. Yeah, I'll talk to you later. Bye. Lot of raccoon talk. Oh, shush, she asked. She loves that stuff. You know, Ginger could've listened to me forever, but she had to take her daughter to a slumber party. Slumber party, huh? My condolences to Ginger's daughter. What? What's wrong with slumber parties? Yeah, and while we're at it, what's wrong with diarrhea, huh? Slumber parties are the cat's pajamas. Especially when I wear my cat pajamas. Wait. How many slumber parties have you been to? One and a half. I fell asleep at a regular birthday party. I'm counting that. You know, if you wanted to, you could have a slumber party here, Louise. You can invite girls from your class. (laughs) Have you met the girls from my class, Mom? Here's what I'm pretty sure is going through their heads every moment of the day: Stickers, stickers, stickers, stickers, stickers, stickers, stickers, stickers, stickers! What kind of stickers? I love stickers. Anyway... But, honey, you need a BFF like Ginger. Let me tell you, they're not easy to find. Got to slumber through a lot of parties to meet your Ginger. She's right; I had plenty of false starts before I met Ken. Who's Ken? His adult albino friend who does improvised hip-hop. Mm-hmm. Yep. But Ken's also not real. Hey! I had an imaginary friend. She used to steal from me. All my makeup, my lipsticks. Well, thanks for the life advice, everybody. Food for thought, ooh, yum. Full of it, lots of thoughts. (Linda sighs) I'm worried about Louise. What little girl doesn't want a slumber party? Are you really surprised, Lin? She's not the most social kid. She still hasn't accepted my friend request, and I know she's seen it. Ugh, drives me nuts. If Louise would just do the things she hates, I know she'd love it. That sounds like nonsense. Nonsense or mom-sense? I think you might be making too big a deal about this slumber party thing, Lin. It is a big deal. It's a part of growing up. Like getting braces or throwing rocks at cars. You used to throw rocks at cars? Yeah. Cars wouldn't even come down my street after a while, 'cause they knew Linda would get 'em. Okay, somebody give me a hand with the coffee table; We got to move it. Finally, we're giving this dump a makeover. I've been carrying these swatches around for years! No, guess again. What... wait, what's going on, Lin? (laughs) (doorbell rings) Oh, who could that be? Maybe it's for you, Louise. You better check. Sure. Strange visitors at a weird hour? Send your kid to the door! Go. I hope it's Matt Damon. I wrote him over a year ago. Hi, Louise. Slumber party! (whoops) No. No, no, no, no, no! Ta-da! Louise, you're having your very own surprise slumber party. Ha ha! No! Linda: Bunch up, bunch up. Go. Don't let her through, don't let her through. Get her, get her. (Louise screams) Best friends forever! Get the door. Slumber party fashion show! All right! All right! Slumber party fashion show! Come on, jump in any time, sweetie. (growls) Okay, she's still warming up. Here we go. This is happening? Seriously, Dad. I... Dad, is this real? I think it could be fun. Oh, yeah. I'm gonna go finish, uh, something that's... Oh, you know what? I'll do it for you and you just... No, no, you stay, it's your party. ...enjoy the fashion show. Got to go, have fun. Uh-uh-uh, Louise, come on, uh-uh-uh. No, please, Dad! Come on... Ooh, look at Harley in a classic pink feather boa and one of my old nightshirts! Okay, next model. Go! I'll go! Gene, you just went. Give someone else a turn. (grumbles) I'll go. Ooh, rain poncho and sunglasses. Forecast calls for fabulous! That's it. I'm out. Thank you! Oh, no, you're not! Stop it. You're being very rude to your guests, Louise. Am I, Mom? 'Cause let me tell you about my "guests." Fashion show... That's Harley. Whoa, look at this fluffy boa snake. I'm glad it's not a real snake. Could you image it? It's fake; It's a boa. As in "Harley ever shuts her mouth." Louise, what are your ten favorite colors of dogs? Mine are red, brown spots, black, white, orange spots, kind of brown, kind of black, brown spots, black spots, red spots, red stripes... And Jodi over there? She's so afraid of germs, she's never sat on a toilet seat. Or any seat! (groaning) And then there's Abby. She likes to braid. Stop it! Stop braiding my mops, Abby! But they look so pretty. And finally, Jessica. Bland, boring Jessica. If she was a spice, she'd be flour. If she were a book, she'd be two books. Oh, yeah, she is boring. Well, you know what? By the end of the night, you're all gonna be good buddies. Uh-huh! She's Abby! She's got heels on! Ow! Ow! My ankles! Lawsuit! Okay, okay, you're okay. Come here, honey. Get up. Come on. There she is. She's dancin'. Uh, excuse me. Mrs. Belcher, I'm ready for bed. What? You're poopin' out already? It's 8:15, Jessica. What're you...? Huh? See? Well, that's my bedtime. What are your parents, farmers? No. Osteopaths. Osteopath? What's that? It's the-the study of the-the body... Okay, that's nice. Okay. Tina, put her in your room. Good night. Okay. Well, guess I'm gonna turn in, too. (yawns) No! You're staying right here, young lady. And you'll be glad you did when you hear what we're doing next: Tie dye! Yeah! No! Yes! No! Yes! Oh... that's an even worse form of dying than actual dying! I would take actual dying right now! Oh, so dramatic. No! (Linda grunting) My hand! Ow! Okay, great. Tying and dying. (trash cans clatter) Hey, all right, Little King Trashmouth found himself a piece of pizza. Aw, wish he could come to the party. He could take my place. Aw, that's sweet, but no. Give me a shirt! I'm gonna make the psychedelic crop top of my dreams! Gene, I only got enough shirts for Louise and the girls, honey. Hey, here's something you can do: You be the pesky brother! You're runnin' around, you're pullin' the little girls' pigtails... On it! Don't you dare. Ow! Sorry! Um, I don't even want to do this. It's my job. (groaning) I'm making it fun! How about me, Mom? What's my angle? Well, Tina, you're the older sister. You're over all this stuff. You want to go to the mall with your friends and beep each other on your beepers. Beep-beep! Cool. A sarcastic mall rat. As if. That's it! You're gettin' it! Okay. You're okay. No one knows. You'll deal with it in the morning. Go to sleep. All right! Harley, what you got? (laughs) I made an orange and yellow tie dye, because my cat is orange and yellow. And my cat's name is Popover. What's your cat's name? My cat's name is I Don't Have A Cat Stop Talking To Me Right Now, Harley! Aw, so cute. Where is it? Okay, now you girls just sit tight. I'm gonna get these shirts out of your way. Louise, stop it! Stay. Okay. Ah, better check on Jessica. Jessica? (snoring) You asleep? Aw, look at her. Snoozin' away. Sweet little, boring little lump. Whoops, oh, my tie-dyes. Got to get these to the tub. I'm just gonna make like a tree and go to my room. Can I braid your hair now? Say yes! (sighs) If you have stickers I'll trade you, but my stickers are really rare so one of mine equals six of yours. Ugh... I need antibacterial soap and your mom only has seashell-shaped soap. Ugh... These are really rare. Please let me braid your hair. Oh, I could it around the side. I could do it across the top. (girls talking over each other) Louise: Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! It is time to turn this slumber party into a going-away party. Going-away party? That's awesome! (laughing) Yeah, it's really gonna be fun! Why are you pinching my arm? Bob, are you at a good stopping place? Can I come in... Oh, whew. I know. Whew, don't tell the little squeamish one you did that so close to her shirt. I won't bring it up, but if she asks, I'm not gonna lie to her. Linda: Next activity! Make your cupcakes pretty, everybody! And then we're gonna eat 'em up! (whoops) Mrs. Belcher, could we turn our heads to the side so we don't breathe on each other's cupcakes? Uh... sure. Whatever you need, Jodi. Everyone, turn your heads to the side. Ooh, okay, this is fun. We can't see what we're doing so well, right? Ooh, mystery cupcakes! Germaphobe, huh? Germs are all around us. They're in our scalp, in our eyebrows, in our mucus membranes. Someday, a cleansing rain will come. That's what I keep telling myself. That's what I keep telling myself. Oh, yeah, I'm looking forward to that day, Jodi. I really am. Yeah. So, uh... what are you doing here? I mean, gosh, didn't they tell you, Jodi? Tell me what? About my mom's... infection. (gasps) She's got sewer palm. (gasps) And strep thumb. (gasps) Luckily, her whooping butt is in remission. (gasps) Oh!  La la la la la la!    I love sprinkles! Just let 'em sprinkle through your fingers! Oh, no! Germs! Germs! Everywhere! Ah! Unclean! Unclean! Jodi, Jodi, stop it! Jodi, Jodi... (crying) Calm down. Ah, don't touch me! Okay, oh, oh, I'm sorry. Sewer palm! Sewer palm! Ah, okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Bobby! Mr. Belcher's taking you home. Get her out. Really? Okay. Uh, let's go, Jodi. (crying) Oh, God. All right. One down. Hey, just 'cause Jodi had a freak-out doesn't mean the party's over. Who wants to watch a movie? Me! Ooh, I do! It's called Twincinnati: Two twins who live in Cincinnati. Oh, they're gonna eat chili on spaghetti! Sounds twin-teresting. Saddle up for round two. I know what everyone's thinking. A girl went home. Wouldn't it be perfect if Tina took her place in the slumber party? (scoffs) Thanks, but no thanks. Tina, you can watch the movie if you want. Oh, good. (groaning) So how's school this year? (breathless): It's okay. The classes good? I have trouble with math. Yeah, I never liked math. (groaning) And I'm trying out for field hockey. Say again. Trying out for field hockey. I can't quite make out what you're saying, Jodi. It's okay. And that's the same actress playing both twins. They do it with a mirror. It's controversial 'cause it takes jobs away from other actresses who look like that actress. Please stop talking! You're ruining the shopping montage! Sorry about my brother. He gets a little sensitive when twins come up. Oh, why? Gene has a twin. George. He lives in the basement. In... in the basement? You'll probably see George later. Mom lets him out at night so he can air out his hump, and his stump. Uh, I don't know if I want to meet him. Oh, of course you do! But when he's up here, just don't blink. Huh? If you blink, he goes crazy. Ooh. Also, he speaks in farts. Uh, what? And even if you think farts are funny... 'cause they are... just please do not laugh. Okay. 'Cause I laughed once... Yeah? ...and he bit off a piece of my butt. What? That doesn't... That's why I'm sitting like this. 'Cause I don't have two butt cheeks to sit on. Is that why you dance weird in dance class? Shut up, Harley. (squeaking) What's that noise? Oh, no. (gasps) What are you up to, El Diablo? You get away from there. (raccoons clamoring) Oh, my God, the king's under attack! It's a rac-coup d'etat! Ha, hey, you girls still having fun, right? I'll be right back. Got to go deal with something. It's not a wild animal, so everyone's okay. (laughs) Oh, Mom's probably going down to turn George loose. No, I-I don't want to meet George! Just don't look him in the eye, and you don't blink and don't laugh. But I don't want to have my bum bit. Oh! You just blinked. You need to practice not blinking. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. What's... what's going on in here? I-I want to go home. Take me home! Wait? Why? Okay, um... are-are you sure? I-I just got back from taking Jodi home, so... I'm sure, I'm sure! Well, she seems pretty sure, Dad. Does anyone else want to go home? Tell me now. Um, are you gonna let me braid your hair? Not a chance. I'll come, too. And... we're done. Okay, if anyone needs me for anything, I'll be in my room forgetting tonight ever happened. Good-bye forever! Thank you, family! It was a nice try! Wait, what about the girl who went to bed early? Right. Jessica. All right, Snorey Feldman, up and at 'em! Huh? A walkie-talkie? Hello? Jessica? Jessica: Uh, yup. What's up? Okay, I'll say it walkie-talkie style. The slumber party is over and out! Oh, no, I'm not leaving. Excuse me? Yeah, you're not getting rid of me like the other girls. Uh, ten-40. Love you, kisses. (blowing kisses) What? No! No kisses! Jessica! Oh, it is on like flan. Do you eat flan, Jessica? Because I've never had it! Bob: Louise? Am I taking Jessica home? Take the others home, Dad. I think Jessica wants to stay and play a while. So that means I'll still need to take her home later? Oh, yes, Father. Oh, yes. Bob: Great. Okay, Jessica. What's your problem? Why the drama with the walkie-talkie? Jessica: Where is it? Where is what? You know what. I know you're messing with me because that's what you did with everybody else. I would love to mess with you, Jessica. Unfortunately, I don't know what you're talking about. Wait, you seriously don't know what I'm talking about? No, but now I kind of want to know. Well, I can't leave until I find what I'm looking for. So let's just play it cool and respect each other's situations. Uh, okay, I'll respect your situation. Right here in... the closet! Gah! Wait a second. These walkie-talkies were in my bedroom. Oh, yeah, your bedroom. It's nice in there. You picked my lock? It practically picked itself. You pick yourself! You pick your nose! You pick your butt! You pick your nose because you think your face is a butt! And you should think that! (yells) Gene, Tina, where is everybody? Bob, I need you in the bedroom. What's wrong with your hair? What's right with it. Abby braided it. Kids, how's the party? Is everyone having fun? They're about to get to the part where the mayor renames the city "Twincinnati." The plot's got some holes. But also a whole lot of heart. All right! Uh, keep slumber partying! Good pun, Tina. Come on. Thank you. Ow! Shut the door! What's going on? Ginger, I know, I'm about to tell him. Yeah, no, he's got his hair braided. Pretty good, it looks pretty good. Lin! I got to go. Bobby, stay calm. We are harboring a royal fugitive. What? Oh, my God, Lin! There's a raccoon! It's Little King Trashmouth. He's chewing on my good sock. Yeah, He found it under there and he rubbed his scent glands on it on it and now it's his baby... aw! Lin, why is he here?! 'Cause El Diablo attacked him tonight. So I lured him in with some cold cuts. He needs our help. Okay, this is nuts, Lin! Oh, he sounds anxious. Get him some wine. "Get him some wine"? He likes red. A little too much. Listen, We have an intruder on the loose in this apartment. (both yell) Wait, is the intruder Jessica? Yeah. (yells) Here's what we know... by day, Jessica is red-headed wallpaper. By night, apparently she's a master of sneaking around our house and looking for God knows what. I say we help her find her purpose in life. (gasps) A brand consultant! Huh, I can see that. No, hitting the bricks! Lin, I don't want a raccoon in our room. I know. I mean, I don't agree, but I understand. More importantly, we need to take care of this fast so I can get this slumber party back on track. There is no slumber party; I drove the slumber party home. There's still one girl here, I think. (gasps) I know what we can do. What? We could trap El Diablo. With him gone, the king can return. That's ridic... Whoa! He just looked right into my eyes. See? Oh, my God, he just raised his paw. I think he just gave me the double g*ns. We could hire Teddy to help us. He has a live animal trap from the time he thought a squirrel was stealing his mail. Sure, that... Hey, buddy. How you doing? Let's put a hat on him. All right! You hear that, El Diablo? We're coming for you. All right, let's just keep this a secret from the kids, right? We don't want them coming in here and getting bitten. Aw, babies getting rabies. Why don't we tell Mom and Dad about Jessica? They could make her come out. Oh, no. She's mine. Mom is not gonna have anything more to do with this slumber party. You hear that, Jessica? Or should I say Jessi-can't find what she's looking for? Yeah, I hear you. But all it sounds like is this. (making fart noises) You know what Jessica? Why do you even want to stick around here, sweet baby? This slumber party's not good enough for you. Yeah, the hors d'oeuvres were blah. And Louise's family kind of smells. Just tell me what you're looking for and I'll help you find it so you'll leave my house. I can't. And I can't tell you why I can't. Oh, and also I won't. (groans) Don't be boring and mysterious, Jessica. You can't have it both ways! Got to go. Click. Tina: She hung up. She didn't hang up. Louise, look! (quietly): Louise, you should say, "I'll take what's behind curtain number one." Because she's there behind the curtain. Jessica, it's curtains for you. Oh! That's better. Who could be hidden behind a little curtain? I wonder. It could be Dad. He has dainty feet. And Dad likes to hide from us sometimes. Okay, it's me. Happy now? I'll be happy when you leave. I'll leave when I find my thing. Until then, slumber party on. All right, you want a slumber party? Well, then say pillow to my little friend! Tina: Whoa. Pillow fight. It's about to go down. Goose down. (both grunting) (pants, grunts) I know you're close, Jessica. I can hear your boring breathing. (yells) (grunting) Oh, Tina? Yes? Gene, is this your first time as a human shield? Yeah. It's my third time. You're doing great. Thank you. (grunts) (yells) (yells) Oh! I'm gonna knock you out the door! Gene, get me the memory foam pillows from Mom and Dad's room. Fat Man and Little Boy? On it! Teddy: I came as quickly as I could. Is it true? Was the king deposed? Yup. There's the b*st*rd now. Teddy: Yeah, look at him. El Diablo. When did you both become crazy raccoon people? Linda's been telling me stories about these little guys. It's like I'm part of their magical world. Mm-hmm. Well, let's set up the trap and get this over with. What are we gonna bait it with? Huh? The bait. Bobby, you can make him a burger. Burger, yeah! He won't be able to resist. Right. Ugh, guys, I don't want to make a burger for a raccoon. Please, Bobby? You can even name it like you like to do. You call it a Medium Snare burger. (both laugh) Right? Hmm. No, wait. The Cage-in burger. Oh. Get it? Because he's gonna be in a cage? Fine, I'll do it. But I'm not naming it. Oh, good, all right, yay. Bobby, thank you! Medium Snare burger. Right, Bob? That wasn't so hard. Bob makes it sound so hard. Having fun... Jessica? Oh, yeah! Tons! Thanks for... inviting me! (yells) Raccoon! Raccoon in the tub! Aah! Jessica: What the... Aah! Aah! Give it! Give it! Um, I'm no park ranger, but if a weird raccoon is holding something, let him keep it. Wha...! Raccoon! Raccoon in the tub! Code orange! Code orange! Give it! Give it! Aah! Give me that! What is it? Pajama bottoms? And they're wet... with pee? Are you a bed wetter? Is that what this is all about? It's not pee! If it is, that raccoon really likes your pee, Jessica. What's your secret? No! It wasn't me! Your... mom came in here and she peed all over the place! I saw it! Mmm, that does sound like Mom. Aah! All: Whoa! Whatever your pee is selling, that raccoon is buying. Great, everybody have a big laugh. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Do you think this is gonna work? Have faith in your burger, Bobby. Look. He's going for it. Oops, I spoke too soon. What if he doesn't like your burger? That would be really embarrassing. Shh. Of course he's gonna like it. Not necessarily. Look at him. Sniffing around. He does not like what he smells, Bobby. I'm not arguing this with you, Teddy. You didn't cook it well enough. (shushes) (whispers): You didn't cook it well enough. Should've put some ketchup on... Nope, he's eating it. Going home, huh, Jessica? Yup, just waiting for your dad to come back so he can drive me. Good. You really cut into my night. So, I guess you're gonna tell everyone at school about this, right? I'm not gonna tell anybody. I'm no narc. Oh. Make fun of you for wetting the bed? What is this, the '90s? Come on. You got a good system, though, huh? Bring plastic bags, go to bed early, then get up first and dispose of the evidence? Yup. So why go to slumber parties at all? My mom makes me. She's out of control. Well, I wouldn't know anything about that. Psych, my mom's crazy, too. Oh. Hey, you're pretty good with a pillow by the way. Thanks. Self-taught. So, do you get a lot of raccoons in here? Why, you jealous? Yeah, a little bit. Hey, what are you two still doing up? Oh, do you want a ride home now, Jessica? Okay, I guess it's time. What? It's a slumber party. Why would she go home? Whoa, wait a second. You two are having a good time. Ugh, Mom, stop! Aw, my little BFFs. Shush! See, I knew you'd like it. It all worked out the way I thought it would. Tomorrow we're going clothes shopping. No! Yeah. No. Yeah. Here he goes. He's almost out. Go, Bobby, go! Aw, sorry, King. Great broom work, Dad. Yeah! If I was a raccoon, I'd leave. He's out. Now we can all go to bed. Psst! King! Drink responsibly. Okay, good night. © 2014 20TH CENTURY FOX TELEVISION
"Festival of Magic"? This whole town's gonna be full of magicians turning tricks! Hi, Jimmy, Jr. Hi, Zeke. What are you wearing? Is it cape o'clock, already? It's for the Young Magicians Competition. I'm in it to win it. Abraca-yeah-bro! I support ya! I didn't know you were into magic. I thought you were more into dancing. Well, I dance a lot during my magic. Like this. (grunts)  Ta-da!  Whoa! Where'd the hell that come from?! He's like a magical florist! Thank you. Oh. Whoop! Maybe I'll come to the competition and cheer for you. Whatever. It's a free country. He's so patriotic. Okay, then, see you at our date. It's not a date. Yes, it is. Not really. Pretty much, it is a date. Definitely not. Whoop. Linda: Oh, this promotion is a great idea, Bob! I love magic! I know. Me, too. Ooh, I'm gonna stick a quarter in my ear, so they have something to pull out. Yeah, the only problem is, this sign could actually attract magicians, so... Louise, this will be good for business. Plus, magic is fun. Mm-mm. Magic can take you to places you could never possibly imagine. Like Delaware! Oh, look, here comes our first magician. Or a Wild West wedding DJ? Hello. Hello... Hello. Um, I couldn't help but notice your sign. Notice anything else? Whoops. Uh, oh, where'd that come from? (laughs) Uh, come on in, Mr., uh... Mars Sazerac. Boy, that is a... magicky name. Hold on. How do we know you're a magician? Show us a trick! Oh, write my name on a piece of cake, put it in a box, and I'll eat it! Sorry, don't listen to him. He's just wants to eat cake. Fine, write it on a piece of pizza and put it under my desk. It's always gonna have something to do with eating something. Just hiding food in places that he already knows the location of. I mean, it would be nice to see something, like a trick. Well, I suppose me and my 52 friends could use the exercise. Oh, God, it's happening! Miss, could I ask you to be my assistant? Oh, I couldn't. No. Okay I'll do it! Oh, that's right, magicians have assistants... (grunting) Ta-da. Now I'll need a volunteer Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me...! Gene, me! Linda: Me! You're already the assistant, Linda. Oh. You win. No need to shout. Thank you. Bye, Gene. Bye. Okay, Bob, let's move you over here so the audience can see you. Right here? Perfect. Now, you're going to pick a card. And while you're doing that, Linda's going to get me your biggest knife. I have it right here. Butcher knife, check! Whoa, why do you have that? Me and Gene were playing pirates. Mm-hmm. Pick a card, Bob. Show it to them, not me. Okay, everyone, here's my card. Nice one, Dad. Okay. That was not a very good trick. Now, Linda, cut the deck, literally. Go on! Whack it! All right, step back. Whaaah! Whoa! Still not a great trick. Well, well, looks like we have a survivor. Recognize this?! (gasps) Ha-ha! That's not my card. Oh. Hit the bricks, Fail-dini! You had your sh*t, you blew it. Well, so much for the magician's discount. In fact, maybe I should pay you. Wait... that looks like my wallet. Did you take my wallet? Oh-ho-ho, slow down, there, Bob. Before you call the cops, you'd better check the I.D. (gasps) My card! (gasps) Oh, my! Wait... how did you pick my pocket? I didn't feel anything. Oh, I feel something. I feel like I want to magically steal things, too. This must be what it's like when people get called to the priesthood. (gasps) I accept. Whoa! I've seen canned tuna, but never canned Tina! Ugh! You're such a locker stalker. Good one, Tammy. I know. (chuckles): Oh, hi, Jimmy Jr. It's like I was padlocked in a box, and you set me free. (grunts) Um, okay. Hi. How did you know my locker combination? It only took a couple thousand tries. Allow me. Okay. Is there anything else I could assist you with? Uh, I need to get my science book. This perfectly ordinary textbook. Thanks. You know, I could also assist you with your magic act as your magician's assistant. Classy. Like a lady butler. Um, okay, I-I guess you could do that. I practice after school. Oh, okay, cool. All right, see ya. Yes! Yes! Yes! Zeke: What? What? Oh, I just found a cool book I've been meaning to read. Oh, it's mine. Oh. That's his! Can I borrow it? No, I don't think so. I kinda need it. Okay, I'll read it here. Bye. (funky music playing) (grunting) Tina: Um, Jimmy Junior?! What, Tina? Maybe I should be facing the audience, too? Fine. Tina: Um... okay, there's more? Remember? The blades? I remember! (mumbling) Stupid magic.  Ta-dance!  Uh, hello? Jimmy Jr.? What, Tina? If this were a dancing competition, forget about it. But you might want to put a little more flair into the actual magic. What makes you such an expert, Tina? You've only been doing magic for a day. I've been doing it for nine days! Jimmy Jr., they spilled a crate of yogurt in the cafeteria! Let's go slide around in it! Cool, Zeke. Come on! Let's go! Wait up, Zeke! Okay, I'll be here. Sweep up all the confetti, okay? Okay, Gene, let's start with an easy mark. Uh, there we go. You distract while I extract. Got it. Andy, there's something I need to ask you, but you have to really focus on me while I'm saying these words! Oh, okay! I'll focus, too! I've never done that before! What do you think of bacon? Hmm? Bacon, bacon, bacon. Andy, someone's trying to steal your candy! Ugh! Thanks, Ollie! You're welcome, Andy! Damn it, Ollie! How did you know?! I felt it coming out of Andy's pocket! Get a womb, you wacky twins. That hurt my feelings. I felt it hurt your feelings! You did? Yes! (indistinct conversation, hearty laughter) Ah-choo! Oh, I wish somebody had a really long handkerchief up their sleeve. Anybody? Hmm? Come on. Where's the pizazz-matazz? I thought they'd get more food. They split an order of fries three hours ago and they haven't ordered anything since. Now they're just loitering. They tricked you, Bob! It's what they do! So, Sazerac, can I get you and your friends anything else? Remember, it's half off, so don't hold back. Ah, well, your delicious fries have left my fingers greasy. Bring me a huge plate of napkins. Well, how 'bout a burger? I can get you a... Napkins. All right, napkins. Get him a napkin. Hey, Bob, I think he got your wallet again. (laughs) And keys! And your gas pills! And your dignity. Ha-ha, ha-ha-ha, great. Hi, I'm looking for a magician's assistant's costume. Something classy! So no butt cheek! Well, you're in luck! This is my last assistant's costume in your size. The sequins are French crystal. Well, French-Canadian. Is that good? How much do you know about sequins? Nothing. They're the best. She'll take it! Rented! Okay, what else? How's your magician set for cups and balls? I beg your pardon! (grunting) Oh... That looks pretty advanced. My magician's better with his feet than his hands. He's more of a dance-ician? Well, for those with only the slightest sleight-of-hand, you can't go wrong with magic rope.  Ta-da!  Great. I'll take that too. The only thing I need now is some magic between me and my magician. Whoa, whoa, whoa... Are you talking about mixing magic and romance? Big time. Don't do it! (both gasp) It's dangerous. Also, don't mix magic with taxes. Or plumbing. That's okay... danger is my middle name. But I spell it R-U-T-H. It spells Ruth. Yeah. Yeah, it does. Mm-hmm. Looks like there's a wait, huh? Yeah. Maybe I'll just come back later. Oh, hold on, that guy's getting up. No, he's levitating! What? Nope, he was just leaning over to fart. You know what? I'll handle this. What are you gonna do? Yeah, wait, you'll see. What? Look, guys, you've been here all day working on one order of fries, so... Understood, Bob. Let me settle my tab. Do you have change for this? (laughs) Sorry I don't have anything smaller. (all laugh) No, you know what? To be honest, Sazerac, I don't even enjoy this anymore. I don't, I, I, honestly don't even like magic that much now, because of you. So, you and your friends, you now all pay full price. No magicians' discount. Well, if that's how you feel, you can have your fries back. Oh, my God. Oh, God! (moans) Look, it says "Ta-da"! That's it! I don't care that that was good. You and your regurgitated potatoes and the rest of your magic buddies, you're banned! Bob, you can't just ban them! This isn't the '60s, you know! Fellow conjurers, let's go somewhere our craft is appreciated. Like my mother's! Oh, and one last thing, Bob. Your name goes in the book. What book? The "Enemies of Magic" book. Good! I want to be in your stupid book because I am an enemy of magic! Well, then this is the perfect book for you! Will this page do? Love it! (gasps) Don't gasp, Linda! Oh! Don't you gasp! Sazerac: Rest assured, Bob, I will never set foot in this restaurant again. And yet, you will never be rid of me! (laughs) (gasps) (gasps) I just got chills! Oh, my God. Come on, J-Ju, get your dance on! I'm doing it, Zeke. My little tiny dancer. Here we go! Look, Jimmy Jr. I got something new for our act... magic rope. Cool! A rope! No, that's not how it works. Yee-hah! Whoo! No... Giddy up, magic cowboy! Come on! Look, you're supposed to cut the rope, then restore it. I can show you. Oh, cool, scissors! Hyah! Hyah! Jimmy Jr., stop. Snipping and a-whipping. Doola-di-doo! Jimmy Jr., stop. Tina, move! Listen to me! Stop it, Tina. I can't dance to the sound of you telling me what to do. Yeah! Boom! I'm trying to help. Assist me assist you. You know what, Tina? This isn't working. That's why we have to keep practicing. No, this isn't working. I am firing you. What? You can't stop my dancing! You can't tie me up with your magic rope! Holy moly! Tell it, James Ju! I'm not trying to tie you up, you gorgeous idiot! Maybe I should enter this stupid contest myself just to show you an actual magic act! You see that, Zeke? Yeah. (laughs) She got pretty mad. Zeke: She's a trip. (laughs) Her face turned purple. Plus, you're not even a magician, Tina. I am now! Oh. It worked in the store. Look, Zeke, tassels! Yeah! (whoops) Come on, let me touch 'em. (Jimmy laughs) So, you and your magician split up... big surprise. Jimmy Junior thinks assistants should be sequined and not heard. So, presto. Now I'm the magician. So, uh... what do you got for this no-trick pony, eh? Set her up. Young lady, you're in luck. Here's a classic of escapology... the straitjacket. Last one in your size. It just takes a little bit of practice and some dislocateable shoulders. I'll dislocate Jimmy Junior's heart... and my shoulders. You sound like you could use the full revenge package. For just $19.95, you could get this... Gene: Hmm... interesting. Dirty tricks: When Doves Cry. The Art of Magic Sabotage. No, thanks. I want to win fair and square. Keeping it clean? I have just the thing. A-ha. Winning clean: A Guide to Not Cheating in Magic Competitions. I'll just take the straitjacket. It's not going to be the last time she says that. It's our family motto! Teddy: Wow. This place looks pretty big without all those magicians in it. Ah! Oh! Whoa! Oh! Oh... Wow, that's never happened before. That flustered the heck out of me. Can I get some water, Bobby? Yeah, sure. What the hell? (gasps) Bobby, it's the curse! Oh! What curse? The Curse of Sazerac! Linda's right, Bob. You're cursed. You're in the "Enemies of Magic" book. (sighs) We're not cursed. We're not cursed. You are. You're the one who's cursed. Yeah. It's your name in the book. The black magic d*ath book. (sighs) Look, it's just a bunch of stupid tricks. Someone must've snuck in and... Where are you going? What? Nowhere. Just, if something heavy falls on you, I don't want to... I mean, I want to be able to help you, bye. I'm not cursed! Aah! I don't want to die!  Don't mix romance with magic  Shoop-shoop, shoop-shoop  Who should face a straitjacket?  Shoop-shoop, shoop-shoop  Don't mix romance with magic  Shoop-shoop, shoop-shoop    (vocalists scatting)  Doo-wah!  Don't mix romance with magic  Who should face a straitjacket?  Dub-a-doo, dub-a-doo, da!  I'm not sure I can escape from my straitjacket. Maybe I should have stuck to being an assistant. No... you're really talented. (Jimmy Junior grunting) Hah! Tammy? What are you doing? I'm Jimmy Junior's new assistant. You couldn't even wait until the Zig-Zag box was cold? Oh, I thought I smelled your B.O. in there. Uh-oh. Battle of the training bras. I feel like I'm back in diapers at divorce court! You know what really stinks, Tammy? His act. It's not magic, it's tragic. Don't be such a rhymin' hymen, Tina. Yeah, Tina. You're not even good at it. Yeah, Tina. Oh, Jimmy Junior, you make me so mad! What are you gonna do about it? I'll take it. Here you go! (laughs evilly) Do you have something caught in your throat? That was my evil laugh. I also have something caught in my throat. And... we're in. His magic cape won't be so magic when the hidden pockets are stapled shut. Guys, code red, Hocus and Dopus! Tina, start stapling! Hurry! (grunting) Done. Go! Split up! (grunting) You missed the cape, Tina! Oh, hi, Jimmy Junior. We were just leaving in that direction. Man, I wish I had siblings I could walk that close with. My brother's 44. Tina: There has to be something else in here that will ruin Jimmy Junior. This one would be great, if we had eight weeks, 25 rabbits, and a fireman's hose. Ooh, look at this one. "Find the heart of his act, and cut it out." Like when Shelley Long left Cheers. Linda: Okay, Tina, time to put on your straitjacket. Oh, all this white, it's like your wedding day. Oh, I'm tearing up! Thank you, Mother. I must prepare. Boy, she's really in the zone, huh? Uh, I think I should stay here, Lin. Protect the restaurant from another Sazerac attack. A Saz attack. Forget the restaurant, Bob. You're gonna be cursed, no matter what. You might as well come support your daughter. And let's be honest, Dad, how much more cursed can you really get? What, is he gonna give you an even weirder body? Thanks, Louise. You got it. Bob: Great. Sazerac's the emcee. I can't get away from that idiot. So... maybe... I'm going to get even with him. Linda: What? I mean... uh, nothing. Be right back. Good luck, Tina. Okay, my little Teenie-Weenie Houdini! Go kick some butt! Some butt, or one butt? Okay... We need to go, too, Mom. Uh, I'm Tina's... silk scarf wrangler. And I'm the one who has to make sure there's nothing up her sleeves. I love that. All right, Team Tina! Go, Team Tina! Enjoy your complimentary cold-cuts, Saza-jerk! The "Enemies of Magic" book! David Cassidy? Larry Bird?! Diane Keaton? Ha! My name's not in your book anymore, Sazerac, but this is! Uh-oh, that's not good. Ow. That's a peppercorn. (groaning) (muffled) Say that again. Now we cut out the heart of Jimmy Junior's act and put in this. (gasps) "Poly-rhythmic synth-jazz"! No one can dance to that. That's right. Not even Jimmy Junior. Yeah! Here's the new music for Jimmy Junior's act. Um, I don't see anything on my list about new music. Look, we did a Kickstarter to make this music Oh, okay, okay! All right! (chuckling): Oh, boy. I snuck into Sazerac's dressing room and I found his stupid book and tore my name out. What? You did what? Ooh... (sniffing) Ooh, you smell like salami. Thank you, and welcome to the Young Magician's Competition! These kids are the magic stars of the future. Well, not all of them. Some will give up, become teachers, doctors... (booing, hissing) I know, I know. I agree, but come on. Let's hear it for our first contestant, The Amazing Jimmy Pesto Junior and his assistant, Tammy Larson! (syncopated synth-jazz playing) That's not my music. Just go with it. I can't dance to this! Damn it! It looks like he's having a funky stroke. I miss you, Grandpa! This doesn't bother me at all, watching my almost boyfriend get horribly humiliated... Ah! Yes, it does! I can't do this! I gotta save him. It's not too late. Oh, maybe it is too late. Still, I've gotta try. (grunting) What are you doing out here? Trying to save you. I switched your music to something with a nine-eight time signature. That's like dance Kryptonite! I know, I'm sorry. I was really mad at you for firing me and for replacing me with Tammy. I'm sorry, too, for being so sensitive about my dancing. So what do we do now? We have the rest of our lives to figure that out. No, I mean right now. Oh. Get off the stage, Tina! You're not his assistant. I am! Deal with it! Sorry, Tammy, I can't hear you while you're rolling away so fast. (grunts) Aah! Hi, Tammy! Bye, Tammy! Great magic! Well, should I do a trick? No, I'll be the magician and you assist me with your dancing. I told you, I can't dance to this music! And I probably can't get out of this. But follow my lead anyway. Okay, Tina. Is this part of the show? Yeah, right? Do a trick! And now, with the help of my lovely assistant, I will perform an amazing escape from the Jacket of Doom. (grunting) Huh. I thought we were getting revenge. More like revenge on us, having to watch. Ho-ho. And now for the master to become the mark... This... isn't going well... Aah!  Ta-dance.  Hah! (applause, cheering) And now, for the winner of the Young Magician's Competition... The envelope, please! (audience exclaims) I can't believe you got out of that thing. How'd you do it? Magic. Off-topic: Would you mind popping my shoulder back in? Yeah, sure. Tina (grunts): Thank you. Now, that's what I call air mail! (audience laughs) The $500 grand prize goes to... Peter Pescadero, the lmpescadaralist! (applause) I can't turn it off! Thank you! And the Honorable Mention Award for On-Stage Chemistry goes to... Tina Belcher and Jimmy Pesto Junior! (audience applauds) Go, Tina! What?! "On Stage Chemistry"? That's almost as good as off-stage chemistry. Why don't you two nerds go have wizard babies? Enjoy your prize. A $50 gift certificate from Wands! Wands! Wands! magic shop. Can not be applied to the purchase of wands. Sweet. Thanks, Tina. Don't thank me, thank my lips. Thanks, lips! See ya! (sighs) Now I see him, now I don't. Way to go, Tina! Your trick was the best! Everyone was talking about it. Thanks, Mom. Cool if we don't hug? So you won the Honorable Mention Onstage Chemistry award. That's something, right? No, I've thought about it and I don't think it is anything. Meanwhile, I picked my first pocket. Sazerac's. Oh, the "Enemies of Magic" book. Thanks, Louise, but I already tore my name out and look what I put in. Wait, what is this? "Look on the back of the page you tore out." "Dear Bob, I knew this is how it would end... Sazerac: "...you sneaking into my dressing room, "licking my cold-cuts, "and ripping your name out of the book, which I then let Louise take from my pocket." He let me take it? Wow. That guy is good. Yeah, he's great! There's a P.S. Sazerac: "P.S. I farted on the meat." Oh! Oh, God! Oh! Well, I hope you learned your lesson, Bob. Don't lick meat. Disagree.
Ah, hmm, looks like Jimmy Pesto's big Super Bowl weekend is starting early. No, no, no. Higher. Every year it starts earlier and earlier. Like ant season under Gene's bed. I'm having my own Super Bowl blowout this year. I'm holding all of my BMs until halftime, when I will make a Super Bowel! Gene, you can't hold your poops in, all right? You got to set 'em free where they can go down the sewer and they find their families and they're happy! I'm their family! I raised them! Hey, you know what? We should do our own Super Bowl promotion. You know, for people who want the option to have good food. Great idea, Dad. We can have people over and order a bunch of Thai. What? No, Tina. I'm talking about our food. Oh, right. That'll work, too. Hmm? What's that jerk up to? (bell jingles) Ugh. What do you want, Jimmy? Hey, saw your little sign. What are you gonna do, listen to the game on the radio and then go out and tell everybody what happened? Come on. What are you talking about? You don't have a TV! Yeah, we do. It's right there. Right there. Where? I don't s... Uh, where? Oh, yeah! Little fella. Yeah! And it has good horizontal hold! Sheesh! How old is that thing? The players are all gonna have English accents. Ah! 'Cause England's old. Don't hold my hand. Get out of here, Jimmy. Yeah. It's no wonder every year my place is packed for the game, while you serve two customers. He's talking about us. Look alive, Mort! Oh, yeah? Well-well, we have our own Super Bowl idea, Jimmy. Yeah! Is it my Super Bowel? Bigger. Impossible! Our idea's gonna get us more business on Sunday than you. Yeah, that's right, yeah. You go, Dad. Our place will be packed, and yours will be empty. Ha! Like Trev's soul. Heh. Whoa. I'm sorry. (groans) That's cute that you think that, Bob. Almost as cute as your little cooking booties. (gasps) They happen to be clogs, Jimmy. Yeah? Well, go back to Holland, you windmill! He's not a windmill. You'll see, Jimmy. My idea's gonna destroy you. Monday morning, you're gonna be like, "What the hell happened?" and I'm gonna be like, "Bob's idea happened!" So, what do you got, Bob? I got nothing. Aw, nuts. No, Dad, we've got nothing. Thanks, Tina. Here's something. It's a grocery list. Hurry back, and I'll make zucchini and wienie paninis. You'll love 'em. Yay. Yay. What am I gonna do to bring in more business? Can't let Pesto win. Again. (high-pitched): I have an idea. (normal voice): What is it, zucchini? (high-pitched): You could k*ll Jimmy Pesto. (normal): Yeah, I could k*ll him. (high-pitched): Yeah, k*ll him today... with me. Shove me down his throat. (normal): That's a great idea. No one... It's a perfect m*rder. (high-pitched): Watch out for that truck! (normal): Or... (high-pitched): Or what? (normal): Nothing. Forget it. Just go back in the bag. A 15-second local Super Bowl commercial is only $3,000. We can afford it, barely. I don't know, Bob. We'd have to empty almost all our savings. What if it doesn't work? It will work. When everyone in the bi-county area sees our commercial, they'll come to our restaurant. I didn't know our county was bi. Good for us. I'm telling you, Lin, we'll make that money back and then some. This is just about you wanting to one-up Jimmy Pesto. No, Lin. The fact that our commercial will play on all of Jimmy Pesto's stupid 18 televisions during the game has nothing to do with it! Th-This is about growing our family business. We'll get so big, we'll run Mort off his land and take his goats! We'll get so rich, we'll never be happy again! $3,000 is a lot of money, Bobby. But a Super Bowl commercial is a game-changer, Lin, and it'll be fun. No. We'll put the whole family in it. No, I don't think... You could sing a song.  Let's do it!  The Belchers are making a commercial!  A family commercial!  Finally, people have a reason to watch the Super Bowl! This is an impressive savings account here. And then here's yours. See the difference? Yes. Good planning; Careful saving. No apparent plan; Small, random deposits. Yes, I-I, uh, I get it. Something. Nothing. Okay, you've made your point. Good. I mean, I shouldn't even be showing you this other account, but I couldn't think of another way to try to help you. Well, actually, it's kind of hurtful. Aw. Yes, I'm basically emptying our account, but it's worth it to have a commercial during the Super Bowl. I mean, I'll be back in here in no time depositing twice as much. Oh, that'll be fun. I'll have our vault enlarged. Okay, uh, financing is in place. Now we just need a $3,000 idea for the family commercial. So, uh, let's do it. What do we got? Bobby, I know a guy who used to be in the NFL; I bet you could get him. Really? That could be great. I don't know. Celebrity endorsement? Sounds a little hoity-toity. Yeah, that might be a little slick for us. It's something Pesto would do. We'll keep it simple... just the food and the family. How about a slogan? Uh, "Where's the burger? Between Bob's buns." (makes fart noise) Hmm. Uh, well, not that. How about this? "Bob's Burgers, like a beef in the night." Mm, no. Huh. You can be the Joint Beefs of Staff. I don't think so. Um, how about, uh, "I beef, you beef, we'll all beef, uh, at Bob's Burgers." Not great, Teddy. Something like that. Oh, oh! "Come meet our family and let us meat you." Get it? Meat? Ha! Hey, Louise, that's pretty good. I'm the smart one! That's good? Yeah, that could work. Lin, you could sing that. Well, yeah, I... Yeah, yeah. Yes, now I hear it. Gene! Give me something bouncy. (electronic music playing) Ma, go! Uh, two, three!  Come meet our family  And let us meat you  Bob's Burgers.  That's great! Ha-ha-ha! I mean, not that exactly, but something like that. I mean, we'll work on it. It just flew out of me. I don't... It just came out. Wow, I love that. Yeah, then we just add some dialogue and show the burgers. This is gonna work. Not to be a Missy Pissy, but how are we going to make the commercial in just four days? Well, there is one guy we could call. I love it! That'll be $1,500. (phone ringing) Worth it! This is Randy. I still can't believe you want to work with Randy. How many times are you gonna let him hurt you? We don't know anyone else who can do this stuff, and he's cheap. I wrote it; I should be the one directing it, not some idiot. Louise. All the best movies were written and directed by one girl. The man did glue a wig on a cow. And that worked out. All right, here he is; Get it out now. Randy's a pain in the butt. He has bad breath. He pees sitting down, facing the toilet! He smells like a hamster cage! He's average height. Tina, that's not really an insult. Okay, here he is. Hey, buddy. Hello, Belchers. (others shout greetings) You're stupid. What? Nothing. Hey, uh, what did you think about the script? What did I think about the script? Oh, quick question: Did a kid write it? Actually, yes. This kid. Me. And just to explain who's in charge, this is a point-and- sh**t operation; I point and you sh**t. Well, we will see about that. No, I'm the puppet master, and you're the guy who gets the puppet master a glass of water. Uh, puppets can't get water for people. That's not true. There's a lot of movies where puppets get water for people. Okay, guys, guys, guys... I-I am a filmmaker. Name one movie where puppets get water for people. Pretty Woman. I will have to rent that and see. Come on. Randy, look at this. Pretty good, huh? Miniature city for our big final sh*t. It's not awful. And Linda and Tina unroll the banner. With glamour.  While we sing.  Lovely. And where's the banner? (sings fanfare) Ha! There... Oh, there, yeah. Wow. That's great. You spelled "meat" with little hamburgers. So you know it's meat. They look like little butts, Tina. Yeah, it works on every level. And... Louise: Action! action! Only I say "action," and I just said it, so action!  Come meet our family  And let our family meat you. Hey, meat me. (plate shatters) (groans) Cut! Cut! Cut, cut. Everybody stop saying "cut." I will say "cut." Oh, I screwed that up. My fault. Butterfingers over here. Everyone was wrong. Cut. Sorry. No. There's one for your blooper reel, right? Show that at the wrap party. At Bob's Burgers, we use only the freshest ingredients. Cut. Tina, what was that? A sexy hair flip. Why? Was it too sexy? No, just why are you doing that? It's for my "wow" factor. So Jimmy Jr. sees the commercial and goes, "Wow." Stick to the script, Tina. You can weird it up in the mirror whenever you want, 'kay, doll? And action, Burger-Zilla! Bob's Burgers has the biggest flavor in all the land! Bah! Bah! Bah! Gene. What? And cue Linda! So come... come by Bob's Burgers today... (hacking):  After the game... (coughs) And cue the banner! Tell us football sent you. Mm! And cut! That's a wrap! I'm a director! We did it! I did it! I did! We're the best family ever! Belchers (off-key):  And let us meat you. Oh, my God. "Oh, my God," you love it? Oh, my God, we're screwed. "Oh, my God, we're screwed," you love it? No. Oh, my God, we're screwed, we're screwed. "Oh, my God, we're screwed, we're screwed," you love it? No. Oh, my God, we're screwed, we're screwed, we're really, really, really screwed. Hey, Bob, what do you think? Why did I think this was a good idea? Why did I throw all our money away on this? Despite the brilliant camera work, I think the problem is the script written by a nine-year-old. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Learn to direct, you hack. I am learning. Bobby, it's not that bad. It is that bad, Lin. The banner broke, Tina did that weird thing with her hair, Teddy can't catch a burger. I just couldn't get my head around my character. All right, so what do we do, Mr. Super Troll? We already bought the airtime; We got to air something. Here's what you need to do: Fire Randy... (gasps, chuckles): I don't think that's the answer. I'll direct it, like I should have in the first place, and it'll frickin' sparkle! Maybe I could try spinning my hair the other way. Like this. (grunts) Teddy, what's the name of that NFL guy you know? No. Sandy Frye. Want me to call him? No. Do you think he'd work for less than $500? Well, he really wants to break into acting. He'd probably do it just for the experience. Great. What?! We can tell people to come to Bob's Burgers after the game and meet a real NFL player. They'll be running out of Pesto's to come here! A football player in a Super Bowl commercial... it's a slam dunk! You want to replace my commercial with Sandy Frye? Not replace, Louise, just reshoot a little, add some stuff. I thought a celebrity endorsement was too slick for us. Let's just take the family out of the family commercial, then we'll take the burgers out, then the restaurant out... it'll be great! It's still a family commercial, Louise. We're just adding a new member to the family... who has name recognition, and is more appealing. Mom, you're letting this happen? Well, you know, I let a lot of stuff happen I don't like. Gene's haircut... What? I want to feather it. Come here. (grunting) I want my name off this project and my last name off my name! Now it's just Louise Louise! Randy: Sandy "Can-Can" Frye. Here we go. Highlight reel. Why do they call him "Can-Can"? Bob: Oh, yeah, I remember. Every time he sacked a quarterback, he'd celebrate by doing the can-can. That was his thing. It was a simpler time. I also brought in some props to make the new final sh*t look more footbally. Some pom-poms for Linda. Rah-rah! Pom-poms for the mom-moms! For Gene, I brought this mouth guard, which I need back by tonight. I grind my teeth. (grunts) And a referee shirt for Louise. No way. I'm not being the referee. I took the shirt off my teddy bear, and you're the only one who it'll fit. Tough break, Randy. Sorry about your naked bear. Louise, a word, please? Listen to me! I know we've had our differences, but I need this! Admit you're a hack, and I'll do it. I am not a hack! Then I'm not a ref. Fine, I'm a hack! But I'm learning, and soon I won't be a hack. But you... you'll always be a little girl. He said he's a hack! Just so you know! Good girl, Louise. Cooperation! Did someone here order an NFL legend? Because next door, they did not, and they yelled at me to leave. Hi. I'm Sandy. Thanks for giving me an opportunity to act in your commercial. I've been working on my accents. Which would you prefer? "G'day, mate" or "That's a-spicy"? I, um... I... Can you do a Russian accent? Can I? 'Ey! I'm a-Russian! It's a-so cold, it's a... No, I cannot. Oh. I'm sorry. I think just your regular voice will be great, Sandy. I'm playing myself? Yes. You got it, Bob. I'm here to carry out your vision, even if you don't want me to do an accent. Now that's a great attitude! Great attitude, terrible concept for a commercial, hack director. Let's do this! Yeah, let's do this! I was being sarcastic, Sandy. And I was ignoring it, little tiny person. Why do you eat at Bob's Burgers, Sandy? Because your burgers go great with Frye. (grunting) Sandy Can-Can Frye! Right on! See, it's already working. People love Sandy! Except that guy ruined the sh*t. Because your burgers go great with Frye. Okay, that's a wrap! Wow! Great day, everyone! Great day! Hey, all this acting makes me hungry. Let's celebrate with some sesame cheddar blasts. Uh, we don't have that. And maybe some toasted jalapeño points. Is that a thing? Mozzarella volcanoes? Uh, we just have burgers and fries, so... See you Sunday! Okay great, Sandy. Thank you. You were amazing. (mocking): You were amazing, Sandy. I want to marry you so I can be Bob Can-Can. I wouldn't take his name. Bob: I'm thinking, uh, what if we maybe zoom in a little more? Like that? A little more. That? Little more. Something like this? Mm, more. This? (high-pitched): Little more. (high-pitched): This? Perfect. Bob: Enjoy it while it lasts, Pesto. Soon, they'll all be coming here. (phone ringing) Bob's Burgers. Bob speaking. Man: Um, hello, dear. Yes, I'd like to make a reservation. Oh, uh, actually, that's a good idea. We're gonna be slammed. Uh, what time would you like to come in? Um, at you're-an-idiot o'clock! (laughs) This is Jimmy Pesto here. Hilarious, Jimmy. Looks like whatever dumb idea you had to outdo me really paid off. Not! My idea will pay off, Jimmy! Oh, really? You have no idea what's coming your way. Here's what's coming your way. (blows raspberries) Hey, hang that up for me, would you? Stupid Pesto! How much longer till halftime? My contractions are nine minutes apart! (groaning) Just go to the bathroom, Gene. You made it all the way to Sunday. It's still heroic. You just don't understand the pageantry of the Super Bowel. Oh, my God, it's almost kickoff. Our commercial is gonna air any minute. Oh, God! I'm so excited. I can't wait to see it, Bobby. Hey, we're on! I'm already addicted to fame! And carbs. Now I'll be recognized for something other than wearing my shirt backwards at school that one time. At Bob's Burgers, we only use the freshest ingredients, and we grind our meat right here. Mmm. That's a ten-yard penalty for unnecessary deliciousness. Hey, you're NFL great Sandy Can-Can Frye. And you're Bob. Come see me here after the Super Bowl. He'll give you the best burger you've ever had, and I'll give you a high five. Tell me, Sandy. Why do you like Bob's Burgers so much? Because Bob's Burgers goes great with Frye. (festive music playing)   (grunting) Bob: Bob's Burgers, conveniently located on Ocean Avenue. Open Monday through "Frye" day. Also Saturday and Sunday. Can-can! Wow! That turned out great! But the family was barely in it! You didn't even show my hair flip. And where was the Giant Burger Boy who pees mustard? The star of the commercial! You cut out all of the singing! All of it! I to you! Dad threw us under the bus! Hey, I understand you're all disappointed, but Randy and I thought this was the best way to go, and Sandy is so great and likeable that... Dah. Is this what you wanted, Dad? All you had to do was ask! Yeah, Dad. Happy now? (rhythmic grunting) No. I mean, yes, about our commercial. But no, no. Get used to it, Dad! This is all we can-can do from now on! (grunting) Yeah... Bob! (grunting) Oh, yeah? Well, this is what's going to get us customers! (all grunting) How long are we going to can-can? 'Cause this is hurting. It doesn't end! You do it till you die! Yeah! Ow! Ow! Hey, look. Sandy is still on TV! What? Jimmy: So, Sandy Frye, why will you be at Jimmy Pesto's signing autographs during and after the Super Bowl? You know, instead of at some stupid greasy burger shack? Because Jimmy Pesto's pizza goes great with Frye. All right. (screaming) What the hell?! That doesn't even make sense! Pizza doesn't go well with Frye! Bob: I don't believe it. Pesto stole our commercial. We're sunk. He beat us again! Who's us? The family you turned your back on? Yeah, now you know how we feel, Bob. The betrayer is betrayed. Karma's a b1tch, and then you die. I'm so upset I don't even have to go to the bathroom anymore. Either that, or maybe I'm going right now. Oh, I really do still have to go quite a bit. What are you doing? I'm gonna go settle up with Pesto! God. I can't get this apron off! Stop. You're like a mental patient in a straitjacket. Tina, untie the back! Karma's a b1tch. Oh, my God! Forget it! I'll wear it over there! Ah, great commercial, Bob. I'm being sarcastic. It was terrible. Ta... You... you never support me! Mm. Randy! Mm! I always watch the game here, Bob! You! Down in front! Yeah! Down in front, Front Butt! Yeah, you make a better door than a window, and you're fat! (laughs) Classic. You stole my commercial, Jimmy! You stole... him! Oh, hey, Bob! Pizza? No, I don't want pizza! I'm angry at you! Oh, because of the commercial? Yes! Sandy, how could you? Before you reject my olive branch, which is pizza with olives, let me explain. After I finished sh**ting your commercial, I came here to get some imaginative appetizers and some pizza... two things you don't serve... and I may have told Jimmy Pesto that I'm an actor now and I had just sh*t a commercial with you to air during the Super Bowl. Which, in hindsight, is probably how Jimmy got the idea to do one himself. With the same tag line. But I hired you first! If I hurt your feelings, or broke a contract with you, that was an honest mistake. Live and learn. Yeah, Bob. Live and learn, and lose. Again! All right, that's it! (grunts) Unplug! Unplug! (crowd groaning) No, not my satellites! (grunts) Stay calm, everyone. I'll have 'em back on in a second. (laughs) Man: Hey, that's that guy from that commercial! Oh, good. You saw my commercial. You copied Pesto! What?! No! I did it first! Pesto copied me! Cry-baby copycat! (laughs): Cry-baby copycat! No! The commercial with Sandy was my idea! And Jimmy Pesto stole it! (grunting) Stop throwing food at me! Wow, it's getting physical over there. Let's just remember him as he was and move on. Well, can't leave him there. Come on, let's go get him. Fine. Wait. Let's let him get hit by one more meatball. There it is. Okay, let's go. I'd go with you, but I don't want to give up my seat. It's a good spot. Nah! Stop it! Nah... Ow! This guy, am I right? Anyway, would you like to see an outtake from our family commercial? Uh... sure? Mm. Did I wow you? I guess. Yes. Ow! Come on! 36 percent! Oh, my God. None of this ever should have happened. I-I made a great commercial with my family. It was funny and cute. Well, it wasn't that funny, but it was good. Well, it wasn't that good, but... but it was us. And I scrapped it to make a commercial I thought would get more customers. I never should have done that. Ha-ha, 59%, folks! (clapping) Thank you, Sandy. Oh, no, I was just responding to the 59%. Jimmy: 62! Don't you... Don't... No! No! Don't clap for that! Listen! Listen to me! I-I made a terrible commercial, but my food's good. You should try it... someday. They're back on! They're back on! The TVs are on, everybody! Ha, ha! The game! All right! Now, you, get out of here! Go stand on your own counter; It's already dirty. Yeah, Bobby, let's go. Linda! Kids! We heard every word, Bob. That was beautiful. Took you a while to get there, but you finally realized I was right. As always. That was just so moving. Speaking of moving, I think my butt water broke! I'll be right back. Don't go! Gene, wait. Thought you were leaving. We're going to. Gene just had to use your stupid bathroom. It's for customers only! Can I get a Pesto Colada? Lin! What? I'm sorry I couldn't hold you until halftime. If I did, I can only imagine you'd be an even more Super Bowel. We'll try it again next year. Good-bye, handsome. You look like a fighter. I hope you go down. I kept flushing! I kept flushing! Oh, my God! You kept flushing what? What happened? What-what happened? He's a fighter. He's a fighter. We have to move. (gasps) Gene's super bowel. Oh, you kept flushing the toilet. Oh, no. (water rumbling) (crowd screaming) Aah, gross! Ew! Oh, my God! Go! Save yourselves! Just remember me! Tell them what happened today! My heart will go on! Oh, hey, there's my commercial for Tran's Noodles. 'Cause Tran's Noodles go great with Frye. I was in a lot of commercials today. Oh, my God, they're all leaving Pesto's! They'll have to come to us! We'll be packed! Well, three people. Ha! Three people, Jimmy! Yeah!  Our food is great  Our staff's full of surprises  So come on down to Bob's  For some burgers and some frieses  (Bob beatboxes)  Come meet our family  That's us!  And let us meat you  With these!  Come meet our family  That's us!  And let us meat you  With these!  Bob's Burgers has the biggest flavor in all the land! Bah! Bah! Bah! (screams) The flavor's so big! (all screaming) (Bob beatboxes)  Come meet our family  That's us!  And let us meat you  Meat me!  Come meet our family  That's us!  And let us meat you  Meat me!  Bob's Burgers.  (makes fart noise) Bob: Bob's Burgers conveniently located on Ocean Avenue. Open Monday through...
"Why I Love Wagstaff." That's the theme? Wasn't it "I Love Wagstaff, Here's Why" last year? Come on, it's cute. "Because Andy goes here." "Because Ollie goes here." Where are our kids' projects? We've been around the whole cafeteria. There's Mr. Frond. Let's ask him where the kids' stuff is. Linda: Mr. Frond! (gasps) Is he trying to hide? Hi, Miss La Bonz. Sorry, uh, Mr. Frond is right behind you hiding. (groans): Oh, happens every day. Frond, are you avoiding us? No! (chuckles): What? No. I'm in-voiding you. Why is your lip all sweaty? (nervous laughing): Uh, uh, what? No, just... Okay, stop it. Where are our kids' projects? We can't find them. Uh, they are, um... they're right there. You didn't point at anything. When you say "right there," you kind of have to point at something. (mumbling): Oh, I-I meant... they're right there-there. Frond, stop. Just tell us where they are. (sighs): Fine. Your children's essays were a little... creative. But I thought they were supposed to be creative. Too creative. Too creative! I like the sound of that, huh? Offensive. They were offensive. The school superintendent is here, and I'm already on thin ice with her because my "credentials" aren't "valid" in this "state." Come on, Mr. Frond, how bad can they be? (chuckling): They're kids' stories. I mean, come on. This bad. Ooh! Let me see that. "The following story is top secret." Louise: If you love Wagstaff like I do, then you need to know the truth. But be warned: Once you know, you can never un-know. It all started last week while I was sitting in class. Not two miles away, the worst evil this world has ever seen had just traveled here. (whooshing) Nude! (mechanical whirring) (beeping) (robotically): Clothing match... negative. Whoa, cool yarn! Clothing match... good enough. (rapid beeping)   (crunching) (screams) Remain calm. Remain calm. No! No! Remain calm. Remain calm. You sent me from the future to help you in this time, to deactivate the student known as Louise Belcher. What?! Ow! Bad hug, bad hug!   (brief beeping) (beeping) (brief beeping) Child called Louise Belcher... I'm on my break. Whoa. Are you a super strong robot from the future? Wait, don't answer that. That's rhetorical. I got to split. (panting) (panting) (alarm ringing) (kids groaning) (brief beeping) (screams) Louise! Calm down. It's me, Darryl. Come with me if you want to continue to be alive. Wait. Why do you look like that? Because... I'm from the future.   Do they not have razors in the future? Because that mustache is not okay. Really? You don't think it looks cool? Uh, nope. (Louise and Darryl scream) (both scream) (panting, gasping) Louise, listen, the Frond that's chasing us is a robot from the future built by the real Frond and sent back to destroy you. No doy. I got that already. I sort of figured this would happen at some point in my life. Quick! In here! I'm dodging for two. Hey, Louise! Hey, weird future Darryl! (loud panting) So, what did I do to him in the future, anyway? It all happened on the day of your eighth grade graduation. Andy and Ollie:  The bombs bursting in air...  (derisive laughter) Hmm? Aah! Hmm? (derisive laughter continues) (screams) (gasps) The brownie chair surprise! I actually did it! Yes. And from that day forward, Frond was never the same. He quit his counseling job and boarded himself up in his basement, working day and night on both a time machine and a robot that he could send back in time. Last week, he succeeded. How did you find out? Because I'm also working on a time machine, and we go on a lot of the same message boards. So you used your time machine to get here? No. I had to use his. Mine doesn't work and it starts fires. So you came back through time just to tell me this? Just to be a narrator? And you didn't bring any special weapons or anything? Just a bucket load of exposition and a stupid mustache?! Do you know what, Louise? At this point, if I had any special weapons, I'd use them on you! But you don't, right? I mean, just to clarify, Darryl. Just to check that box. There he is! Here comes the sweaty- Belcher-belly special! Louise: Ha! (beeping) Louise! What? It was funny. We got to run! (both panting) (both yell) Grab the rope! Ah... (grunts) Run, Gene! (yelling) (Louise panting) Hey, guys, I know we're running from Mr. Frond for some reason, and though I'm totally willing to go along with it, a little lunch would really hit the spot. Small bits of pork throughout the day is what they say. Actually... Maybe someone will drop some food. Come on, creamed corn! (all yell) Hey, guys, can I sit with you? (groans): Oh, fine. So, how's your day? Not great. Yeah, me, too. (sighs) Why? Wh-What's happening? Yeah, no, I'll be fine. I-I, like... brought the wrong book to school. (all yell) Whoa! Mr. Frond! You've been working on your fitness, girl! (sizzling) (Louise gasps) We need more creamed corn! I know! That's what I've been saying! Run to the kitchen! I'll deactivate all of you. Mr. Frond, your skin burned off. We made you a get-well card. It's a banana peel. (beeping) (beeping) (strained grunting) (screaming) (screams) This kitchen is so shiny! Darryl: Gene! Over here! (yelling) (gasps) (yells) (screaming) (clanging) Hey, Frond! Let's do lunch.   (screaming) (relieved exhale) Ah, finally, something fun happened at school. Kids, one; Future Frond, zero. Hmm? (all gasp) Uh... aw, crap. So, now we're here, living off the grid in Mexico, or... someplace, planning, waiting for when they find us. I'm gonna take a nap under a warm tortilla and then eat my way out when I wake up. I've heard of a power nap, but a flour nap? 'Cause tortillas are made of flour. He's under a tortilla. If you're reading this... What? Oh, no, I'm not talking to you. I'm writing in my journal. Oh. 'Cause I... I can hear you. Yeah, I say it out loud, and then if it sounds good, I write it down. Well, I'm kind of trying to sleep under a tortilla, so... You know what? I am sick of being on this beach with you! Okay, then go a little bit down the beach! And by the way, we're in Belize. It says it right on my hat! "Un-Belize-able"! We got them at a garage sale! Yes! But it was just a mile away! "If you're reading this, then there is still a chance for mankind, and more importantly a chance for a really great moment when everyone will think Mr. Frond pooped his pants." Well, I loved it. Yeah, it was good. I mean, it was a little... some of the references I felt were a little... But whatever. Okay, okay, I can see that I'm not getting through to you two. But take a look at this. Okay, Bobby, you read this one. This time, I just want to listen and get carried away with the story. Just want to close my eyes and listen to the story. (sighs) Okay, fine. Okay. Read it out loud. "Fart School for the Gifted." "It was lunchtime at Fart School for the Gifted..." Linda: I love it already! Bob and Gene: ...the coolest school in the world, Gene: And we were all jamming to my new song, "Gas Class." (rhythmic grunting) GENE:  Gas class!  You wanna pass gas class?  You gotta pass gas...  (rhythmic grunting) But then uncool counselor Mr. Frond decided to be a total ding-dong. All right, that's it. I know this is Fart School for the Gifted, but this is not a place for dancing or singing! (plays fart sound) Whoa, nice song, Moz-fart! (kids laughing) That wasn't me. I-I didn't fart. If you liked that fart sound, wait till you hear this one! I've been working on it all year. It'll literally blow the roof off of the school! (grunting) Aah! Give it! Give! (strained grunting) Until you prove that you can behave better, I'm confiscating your keyboard. Where are you taking him?! To my office! I mean, to somewhere you've never heard of. Not my office. No! I'll just follow him and find out. Gene: Aw! Can't believe it! Mr. Frond is probably tickling the ivories. And they're probably laughing, because they don't know any better. Well, there's nothing we can do. Sounds like you aren't getting that keyboard back until you learn to behave better. Or plan "B": We get it back by behaving worse. Keep talking. Gene: Uh-oh, I'm listening to music on a portable tape player, and it's making me very curious about s*x. (gasps) No, no, no, no. No curiosity in the halls. I'll need my lock-picking kit. No, you won't. I've got mine right... (high-pitched):  Here...  (expl*si*n) Hmm? (groans) We've got to get to the P.A. system. But they already did the morning announcements. Remember? Jody had a birthday, and the canned food drive is going great. That is all. That is not all. I have a special announcement. Aah. Aah! (all panting) (grunting) And turn. Hey, uh, there's a Brendan Fraser DVD just sitting in a bush outside. Oh. Mine, mine. Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine. (all grunting) You come out of there right now. Oh, I'm not coming out... but this is.   When you feel like school  Has sucked the wind out of your sails  Remember that it's cool  To use the wind that's in your tails  Fart, fart, fart  Fart, fart, fart, fart  Every fart is a work of art  Don't know where to begin?  Don't know where to start?  Farts will set you free  It's that gas from your ass, it's that toot from your boot  That hum from your bum, it's that loot in your chute  All that air from your own derriere  Come on and set it free  'Cause farts are liberty  (screaming) What do we want to do? Fart, fart! Open up your butt cheeks. This is how our butts speak. Let's... go... Fart!  It's that gas from your ass  It's that toot from your boot  That hum from your bum  It's that loot in your chute  All that air from your own derriere  Come on and set it free  'Cause farts are liberty  'Cause farts will  Set you  Free!    (loud farting) (screams) (expl*si*n)  'Cause farts will set you  Free!  Gene: The end. (sobbing) Are you crying? (sniffles) Oh, it's so beautiful. His farts set them free. He's a hero. Don't you get it? A hero? He wants to destroy the school with farts. Oh, come on. It was pretty ambiguous, Frond. I think he wanted the reader to decide... if the fart destroyed the school. Well, it was... it was still gross. (sniffles) Oh, it was beautiful. And speaking of gross. Heh. "Tina Belcher's Erotic Friend Fiction presents: Why I love wagstaff: A Tale of Horror." Linda and Tina: I'm Tina Belcher. I love Wagstaff. Tina: I love it so much that I became the volunteer sheriff. Okay, I mean hall monitor, But that's like the sheriff of the hall. Something felt off that morning. I could feel it in my bones. My arm bones, my leg bones. All the bones. Aah. Hey, Tina, let me in. I'm late. Tammy, you're tardy. I have to write you a citation if you don't have a note. Ugh. Don't be such a tattle-tampon. I don't want to get detention. Sorry, Tammy, but I... Hello. Excuse me, boys, but do you have hall passes? Or tall passes? (short laugh) Okay, thanks, Tina, you're a sucker. See you later. No, Tammy, come back, I... No! ...got, uh... Wow, she's not cool. We have hall passes. We're on our way to get our jock itch vaccination. Glad to hear it. Jock health is the most important kind of health. Good luck. Great. I hope to see you at the pep rally today. Not if I hope to see you at the pep rally first. (chuckles) Swish. Nothing but butt. (crash) MAN: Oh. Tina: Whoa. That boy's jock must have really itched. Aw. Well, I should get going. That rally isn't gonna pep itself. (low groan) Come on in. Watch your step. Y'all ready for this? (grunt, whoop, squeal) Uh, ooh, mmm, basketball! Basketball...! Announcer: And now, here come your district quarterfinal champions, the Wagstaff Whalers. (cheering) Yay. (growling, groaning) Oh, that's weird. (cheerleaders screaming) (growls) Oh, stop eating my shoulder. (chewing) Now I can't wear halter tops, you stupid zombie. Oh, no, zombies are attacking the school. And I already bought Tammy a halter top for her birthday. Oh, no, the jock itch vaccine must've turned the players into zombies. We spent so much time asking if we could cure jock itch, (zombie growls) we never asked if we should cure jock itch. Aah. (zombies groaning) All: Aah! Guys, this way. (panting) (groaning) We'll be safest in the teacher's lounge. It's the only door on school property that locks. Plus you can smoke in there, in case anyone is feeling stressed out. No judgment. Oh, no, it's locked. What? Is somebody in there? No. Mr. Frond, you have to let us in. The zombie JV basketball team is right behind us. You know, I... I'd love to, but, uh... my... This... (stammers) ...won't budge. Mr. Frond, open the door. No. You can't leave us all out here to get infected. We're just kids. Ow! The door hurt my knuckles. All right, look, let me explain. I have to keep myself safe so I can guide those who survive. They're gonna need me. Makes sense. Mr. Frond, there's a... (muffled) You just stay in there. Keep yourself safe. You're so important. We'll be fine. Yes, I think that's b... aah! (groans) I wonder if she can taste his sadness. (low groan) JIMMY JR.: Oh, no. Uh-oh. We've got trouble. (groaning) Oh, no. We're cornered. Throw Gene at them. I'll soil myself to become less appetizing. (grunts) Damn you, low-fiber diet. Hey, let's spit on 'em. That's what my stepmom does to me when I walk in on her in the bathroom. Great idea, Zeke. Spitting. (laughs) Spit on 'em. Yeah. (hawking) Come on, do it. Big-time loogies. (spits) Oh. Gross, Zeke. (heavenly music plays) Whoa, they're trippin' on your flippin'. Keep going, girl. Yeah, it's working. They think you're flirting with them. Say something nice about their eyes. Mmm, mmm, mmm. I'm losing them. Turn it up, T. Get your flirt on, girl, come on. Okay. Everyone, stand back. Mmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm, hmm. Tina, no! I think we're safe now. I've got them eating out of my hands, instead of actually eating them. Because they're zombies. Man, girls always go for jocks. Follow me, fellas. Let's go somewhere where the 16 of us can be alone. If your butts fall off, pick them up and put them back on. She was never really mine, was she? Who? Oh, Tina. Tina: It wasn't easy dating 15 zombies at once. Oh, wait, yes, it was. Thank you, zombie boyfriends. "Soon, I couldn't tell where I ended "and the zombies began. Butts, butts. I love butts." Okay, I-I think that's enough. I got it. It-it got weird. So I think you can see why this one could not be displayed. I don't know. You're kind of making a big deal out of nothing. I mean, they're just a bunch of kids' stories, Frond. Come on. But... but... But-but... but... But... but... What? Why... why don't they... Why don't they like me? I mean, I... I'm the villain in all of these stories. Aw, don't cry, Mr. Frond, come on. I'm not crying. You are crying. Hey look, you weren't that bad in Tina's story. What? I was a coward! I locked myself in a room while children got eaten! What? Say it again. I said... Okay, okay. I locked... Say it, don't... ...myself... Okay. ...in a room... Mmm. ...while children were eaten! (wailing) Look, Frond, uh, you're... You're not a villain; You're... you're just... You know, you're c... You're complicated. What? And you're really uptight. What? But, I mean, it's not like you actually took Gene's keyboard away. Yes, I did. I have it right here. Oh. Well, so maybe relax a little. Right? Try to talk to the kids about kid stuff. You know? Relate to 'em. On their level. Okay. So, like, um, chicken nuggets and, uh, e-mail. Uh... Well, you're... You know, you'll get to something eventually. Maybe I should try to spend more time with them. Huh? Yeah, or... Yeah, or the opposite. Bob, Linda, thank you. I feel like we've had a major breakthrough in here today. Let's hug. Ow, ow. Let's seal this heal. Ow. Okay. This feels good. So, are you gonna put their projects up? Absolutely not. (groans) (mumbles): Linda. Wha... What? Oh. Look, look, look. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. She got him. Okay, okay. She got him. Well, it's time for me to get back out there and give the big keynote speech: "Behind the Student Body." This is where I really get to show that superintendent my best side. You show him. Yeah, well, tonight's gonna be your night. Thank you, Belchers. Oh, my God. Get your purse. Got it. And Gene's keyboard. Yup. Let's go. Let's go. I'm ready for Pasta Prom! You look gorgeous. Mmm. (gasps) It happened. I felt it. The brownie chair surprise. What? Oh, nothing, Tina. Nothing at all. What happened? Uh, just... I, um... Wait, what did you say? Brownie chair supplies? No, Gene. Brown hair supplies. Is chair supplies... No. "Brownie chair surprise." Right. What is that? Okay, you put a brownie on a chair, Uh-huh. and then you walk away. How is the brownie at all surprised by this? No, the brownie's... Yeah, what... Why... Why are you pranking a brownie? Somebody takes a seat without looking and they got brownie on their butt. Oh! God, it doesn't sound as good when I say it out loud. So it looks like somebody sat in a pile of poo that they put in their chair on purpose. Yes! Right. There is more to... Yeah. That is a great but unusual prank. Thank you. So what happened? (groans)  It's that gas from your ass, it's that toot from your boot  That hum from your bum, it's that loot in your chute  All that air from your own derriere  Come on and set it free  'Cause farts are liberty  Gene: What do we want to do? Kids: Fart, fart! Gene: Open up your butt cheeks. Kids: This is how our butts speak. Gene: Let's... go... fart!  It's that gas from your ass, it's that toot from your boot  That hum from your bum  It's that loot in your chute  All that air from your own derriere  Come on and set it free  'Cause farts are liberty  'Cause farts will set you free...! 
Louise: Click. Click. Click, click. Louise, stop saying click. Click. Click. And, Tina, will you stop typing like that? I'm refreshing my e-mail. I'm waiting for an invitation to Tammy's Bat Mitzvah. I believe the term is badminton. Common mistake. No, Gene. Tammy's Jewish. It's a ceremony where she reads from the Torah, lights a candle and becomes a woman. Sounds like my spa night. Except I read The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. (groans) You know a lot about Bat Mitzvahs for someone who thought Chanukah was Han Solo and Chewbacca's baby. It's about becoming a woman and it's a really great party. Why wouldn't I research that? Plus, rumor has it this one's gonna be packed with B-FOS. What are B-FOS? B-F-O-S. Boys From Other Schools. What's wrong with the boys from your school? I need fresh faces. (quieter): And fresh butts. You'll take the butts you're given and you'll like it! (school bell ringing) Don't you dare call back until it's done! Do you understand me? Okay, bye, Mom. Hi, Tammy. (groans) Tina, I am up to my pits in Bat Mitzvah planning. Mm-hmm. But I figured out the theme, which is "Tammy"! Me, it just makes sense. Nice. You get an "O" for original. And for O-M-G I didn't get an invite to your Bat Mitzvah. Mm, that's 'cause I didn't invite you. Oh. That "O" doesn't stand for anything. It's just me being surprised. I was really looking forward to all those B-FOS. Mm, me too. Yeah, a lot of B-FOS. I got Hebrew School B-FOS. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I got Camp B-FOS. I got B-FOS who are Filipinos. Fili-B-FOS. Got your invite, Tammy. We'll be there. Bat Mitzvah, baby! Hava Nagiddiyup! (laughs) Giddyap, boy! Ow! Get! Giddyap! Ow! (grunts) Ow! Yeah! Well, if a spot opens up, keep me in mind. Spots are for underwear, Tina. Not my Bat Mitzvah. Got to run! (sighs) Tina, that's the third time you sighed on my sandwich. You're heating up the bread. It just seems like everyone's going to Tammy's Bat Mitzvah but me. But you got to go to Shauna's Bat Mitzvah. Shauna had a Bat Mitzvah? Oh! Uh... No! Mom! Shauna Glassman had five caterers at her Bat Mitzvah and everyone talked about how great that was. So, we need six caterers. Find me another caterer or I'm gonna find another mom! Excuse me, Tammy? I couldn't help overhearing your conversation. If you need another caterer for your Bat Mitzvah, my dad can do it. We help him with catering jobs all the time. No, no, we can't do that. (groans) What does he do again? Nothing. No... Burgers. (groans) Can he do sliders? 'Cause I want slider burgers. Oh, no, he's terrible at sliders. He can do sliders. No, he... He can make them as small as you want. Oh... He has a real... He can make them so small you can't even see them. No. I'm eating one right now. (groans) Fine. (phone ringing) He's hired, he's hired. No! Oh, okay. We'll be there! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Just have your parents call my parents. I got to take this. What is it now, Rabbi Rosenberg? What is it now? Yes! Great! Now we all have to go to that "Brat" Mitzvah. Have fun explaining this to Dad! I'm sure Dad will love it. No way. Dad, you have to! No I don't, Tina. I-I don't like catering. You guys always wander off and leave me with all the work. Dad, this is the only way I get to go to Tammy's Bat Mitzvah! Tina, this isn't going to Tammy's Bat Mitzvah. It's working at it. Won't it be awkward for you with all your friends there as guests? You don't understand! This is my way in! She's having B-FOS from all around the world! (groaning) All right, calm down. That's it. Get all the blood to your head. Let it flow. Does it really mean that much to you? Yes! Look at my face! Oh, my God. Aah! One luftballon! Okay, get her up, get her up! (all gru.ting) I don't know. We won't leave you alone this time, Bobby. Right, guys? Eh. Soft maybe. Please, Dad? Fine. We'll do it. Yay! All right! Now can I get circumcised? Gene. I know some people. Look at all this food. It's like we died and went to fancy mall food court heaven. That is the creepiest thing I've ever seen. Tina: I think it's nice. Two mini burgers, please. Hey, Jimmy Jr. Zeke. What's it like out there? So sweet. They even have a DJ in the bathroom. I was dancing so hard I forgot why I went in there. Wow. I've had not one, not two, but three Tammy-tinis! I'm waiting for the sugar to hit me! Here I go, oh! Here he goes. It's gonna happen. It's coming! Here we go. Kaboom! Nice! I'm hyper. Officially hyper. Wow, sounds grea... Hey, can we get those mini burgers? They're taking a long time. Oh, right. Hurry up, T-town. Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for the star of the evening. Tammy!  She's Tammy, she's glammy  She's just a little hammy  If she sang a song right now  She'd probably win a Grammy  You know who I'm talking of  So why don't you all say mazel tov  Tammy, yeah.  Hey, everyone! Mazel tov to me! Mazel tov! Tina, is this Tammy-tastrophe everything you dreamed it would be? I wish I was more in the mix. From here, I can only look at the B-FOS, but not touch. You could probably touch them. You think so? Yeah. (grunting) No, I can't. Aw, I have bad depth perception, sorry. What's going on here? Where are the Tammy toothpicks? Tammy what? All of the food is supposed to have toothpicks with my face on top. Janet, what's happening? Here are your toothpicks. And here's your headset. You didn't give them a headset either? God, Janet! What's this for? So Janet can stay in contact with all the caterers. Duh. Why would we need to stay in contact? Hello?! The toothpicks? That was almost a major disaster. Uh, you're kind of exaggerating, Tammy. I'm exaggerating? Yeah, I think so. A little bit. That is literally the stupidest thing that anyone has ever said in the history of mankind. Ever! You're having a hard day, I think. I'm having the best day of my life. It's my Bat Mitzvah. You're a wonderful little girl. Thank you. What a 'tude. I'm gonna go to the bathroom. During the walk there and back, it'll be like I'm at the party. Great, now we lost Tina. No one else is allowed to leave. Tammy (over headset): Janet, we're out of ranch dressing! Janet: Um... I-I... If a chicken tender touches my lips without ranch dressing I am literally going to k*ll someone! I'm not wearing this. I'll take that. Bat Zilla. (roaring) Oh, no. Who said that? Janet, are you listening to me? Louise: Bat Zilla's angry, Janet. What are you gonna do? Janet: Uh, please, if this could just, uh, I've got two and half me hours? Bat Zilla's gonna k*ll you in under two. (whispering): You're absolutely right. You're absolutely right. Janet, you got to get out of this. Please help, please help! You're better than this! Janet, you know you can do better! Who are you? The voice in your head, Janet. Ah, no big deal. Just the single greatest collection of food ever assembled under one roof. Not gonna wander off. Nah, good Linda. Stay right here. (sniffs) The crepes smell good. The crepes smell real good! Don't know you, don't know you. Janet! What's wrong with Tammy's eye? Uh, that one's a little bigger than that one. Not me! Her! Uh, uh... I need someone to fix the bulb on the Tammy head stat. Janet, you got to get out of here. I do, I do. What are you doing here still, Janet? What are your dreams? I know you've got dreams. I'm gonna... move to New York. You should go there, Janet. And I'm gonna sing and dance! Give me some of that singing. Give it to me now, Janet.  Start sp...  Wake up, Janet! Wake up. You wake up, Tammy. 'Cause guess what? I quit! What?! Oh, how the tides have turned, Tammy! Janet, don't you dare. Oh, look at me. The headset's a-coming off of the ears! Janet, don't you take that ear... headset off! I can't hear you anymore! Janet! Look I respond to nothing, Tammy! Janet! Janet! Nothing but my own desire to be a star! Janet! (laughs) Oh, voice, voice, you've taught me well. Janet! You're welcome, Janet. Excuse me, Tammy? This might not be the best time but can you tell me where the ladies' room is? (groans) Not now, Tina! (panting) Wait, how good are you with a clipboard? I'm okay. Sometimes I get my fingers caught in the clip thing. Here, you're my new coordinator. I am? Yeah. You wanted to be at the party... now you're running the party. Okay, I'll do the... First, the schedule's on the clipboard. We have to stick to it no matter what. Got it? Check. See all those people? Those are my relatives. We're not close and they all have old person face. So it's your job to tell me who's who. How will I know who's...? There's a Tammy's family cheat sheet on the clipboard. Oh, okay. And that's Justin. He's the cutest guy in Hebrew school. Remember that punim, okay? That means "face" in old Jewish language. Justin. The ladies choice dance is at 9:30. And by ladies, I mean me. I'm choosing Justin as my dance partner. That makes sense. And that'll lead right into the hora, which is when I get lifted into a chair and I feel like a Jewish movie star, like Whoopi Goldberg. Would it be okay if I went to the bathroom really fast? Never mind, I-I'll hold it. I'll make it go away. You do that. Louise: Tina, did you just get bat-bullied into being a party planner? Louise? This line is for work only. Why do you want to be the new Janet? Well, at least I'm not stuck behind the burger station. Tammy: Tina, I've got a wedgie and I'm not gonna pick it at my own party! Janet had small fingers! Got to go. Hmm. Hello, guac. Let's take a little walk. Uh, where's Louise? Did we lose her, too? She's on the Mexican food, Chinese food border. It's a war zone! I'll go see if she needs backup. No. Oh, boo. Bobby, I'm getting light-headed, I need some air. Lin, you're not light-headed. You want a crepe. You've been saying crepe under your breath for ten minutes. What?! Crepe. There's crepes here? Crepe. You're doing it. I am not! Don't be ridiculous! Crepe. You just did it. Crepe. What?! Oh, my God. I didn't do nothing. Just go. I told you, I'm light-headed. Just go. Crepe, crepe, crepe. Go. Crepe, crepe, crepe, crepe, cr... I'll be, I'll be right back! Mm-hmm. Crepe! Crepe! Wait for me, Mom! (grunts) Why aren't I moving? I will not be left alone. But Mom said she'd be right back! Gene, look at me. You and I both know your mom's not coming back after just one crepe. She's not gonna stop, Gene. She's never gonna stop. It's who she is. If she stops, she'll die. Like a crepe shark. Gene? Yes. We need to stick together. I'm gonna grill and you're gonna plate. Dad, I never realized how soulful your eyes are. (groans) Gene. Wait, really? Aunt Frida from Florida. She had hip-replacement surgery last year. Aunt Frida! Your new hip looks hot. Tammy, I'm so proud of you on your big day. (grunting) We got a clinger! Tina. Let go of Tammy. (grunts) Those are your parents. I know who my parents are, Tina. Are you having fun, honey? Mom, You got your weird perfume on me! (groans) I got to go swab this off. Tina, make sure we stay on schedule. Okay. It's not weird. You like it, right? Um, yeah, I like it. I wear it. It's bisexual. Do you mean unisex? It's the same thing. It is not the same thing. My swim-aerobics instructor is bisexual. Thank you, Frida. (humming) What? This shouldn't be open! Looks like you got a runny nose, Tammy. (Tammy gasps) What are you doing in my head? (gasps) Whoops. Hey, Tammy! Good to see you there. I thought the tortilla chips were in here. Which is like, so creative. But I guess not. (gasps) You were going to pour guacamole out of my nose like boogers, weren't you?! (laughing): Oh, my God, Tammy, that's hilarious. Let's do it! Stop it! What's going on? I think we're going up! God, it won't open! No! Hello! (screaming) I'm in here! Help us! I'm in here! It's Tammy the Bat Mitzvah girl! No one can hear us over the terrible band! The Klezbians are not a terrible band! Yes, they are! How dare you! Oh, help! (Tammy screams) Tammy: Hello! Louise: No! I'm in here! (yells)     Oops! Gene, easy. That's the fifth burger you've dropped on the floor. That you know of... Tina: Have you guys seen Tammy? Oh, good. You're back. No, I'm not back, I'm the new Janet. I'm really busy. Tammy's supposed to lead off the limbo soon and I can't find her anywhere. I haven't seen her in a while, and I have to say, I have enjoyed every minute of our time apart. Have you seen your mother or Louise? We don't need them! Oops! (sighs) Mom's over by the ltalian food station. Hi! Mm. You gotta try this! I-I mean, I'll be right back! Mm. I gotta find Tammy. We gotta stay on schedule no matter what. Ugh. We're out of napkins. I'll go. I don't know what they're for, but I'll get 'em. No. No. Gene, you stay here. I'll go. Tammy: Help! The headset's clogged. Um, who cares about that right now? You should, Tammy, because the headset was our only way of communicating with the outside world. Now I'm gonna die in here and they're gonna find my bones in your head. This wasn't the head I wanted them to find my bones in! Hello! It's me, Tammy! The star of the Bat Mitzvah! (sighs loudly) Okay. Let's do what I came here to do. You are not pouring guacamole out of my nose. If I pour the guacamole, it might fall on someone and they'll look up and see us. Ugh. Fine. (grunts) Louise: No... no, no! Tammy: Why isn't it falling? Because of your big mouth, Tammy! Someone's gotta notice I'm missing. This is my party. The theme is me. What are you planning to do with this stupid head after today anyway? Um, hello? I'm gonna donate it to charity. I do thihink about other people. Gnocchi. Looks good. Maybe I'll just try one. Mmm. That's really good. Okeydokey, gnocchi. I'm sorry I just said that. Out loud. To myself. Uh... my dad said he'd be right back. He's getting napkins, whatever that is! In the meantime, is anyone here for just a plain bun? Mr. and Mrs. Larson, I can't find Tammy and we're supposed to do the limbo in two minutes. Hi, Other Janet. Sometimes when Tammy gets like this we just let her take some time by herself. We call it Tammy time. But Tammy time isn't on the schedule. Other Janet's moving her mouth but all I hear is, "We-wah we-wah." (laughing) Ow. (sighs) What? Be a man. You be a man. It's time for the limbo! (sighs) Somebody's gotta kick this thing off. I guess it's gotta be me. How low can you go? Not that low. Still too low. Yeah, a little higher. Mm, one more inch? Well, you'll walk right under it now! Yeah, but just in case, a little higher. Okay, everybody, let's limbo! What the hell is your sister doing? Looks like the limbo. Or some awkward version of it. I was supposed to lead off the limbo. I was the one who went to limbo boot camp! Limbo, check. Next on the schedule is the conga line. Gotta stay on schedule no matter what. Whoops. Bob! What are you doing here? What are you doing here? I'm eating this dumpling. Yeah, the food here is really good. They hired great caterers for this, right? Yeah, except for us... sneaking off like a couple of Shirky Shirleys. (laughs) No, no, no, it's okay. Uh, Gene is running the ship over there, so we're fine. Over where? Where-where is he? Over, uh, there, see? Behind the... uh, you can't see from here. Where are we? Yeah. We are not in the same hall as we were a minute ago. It's like the end of The Shining in here. We could get lost. Where did everybody go? Wait a minute, this is a wedding! Hey, boys. It's time for the conga line. Grab on and let's go. Oh, hey, okay. I could get used to being Tammy. Look out for that wall! I got it! (Tammy gasps) Tammy: Tina hijacked my conga line! I want my conga! Looks like they're doing fine without you. Are you kidding? She's all over the road! It's da-da-da-da da-da. It's not supposed to be like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah... (makes farting noise) (headset beeps) Guess what? No, you guess what. When we get out of here, Tina is so fired. I'll have my Bat Mitzvah back and your lame sister can conga her butt outta here. (whispering): You owe me one, Tina. You know what, I can't fix this thing. Looks like you won't be getting your party back for a while. (beeps) It's just you and me, Tam-tam. We're going to take a quick break. We'll be right back. Excuse me, but there's no break on the schedule. Uh, I gotta call my dog sitter. But it's time for me to lead the Macarena. So, hey, Macarena or hey, you're fired.    Hamotzi lechem min ha'aretz.  Tammy's taking Tammy time. I'm filling in. Take it.  Amen.   (guests cheering) It's been almost two hours. No one even notices that I'm not there. Wow. This is like a reverse It's a Wonderful Life. You get toee how much better off everyone is without you shrieking at them. Yeah. (sobbing) Okay, okay, easy there, ugh. Everyone is having a good time without me. It's true. I was being... A horrible Bat Zilla? Yeah. Like, the worst person alive? (sobbing) Just like, a crazy monster? Yeah! All right, there you go. Coming around. (snapping fingers) Hey. Hey. Hey. Look at this! Tammy! What? I fixed the headset. What? I fixed the headset. Oh. Oh! You're a genius! I know. Well, what are you waiting for? Get us out of here! Oh, it's broken! No! (sobbing) Okay, I fixed it, I fixed it. But you watch your tone. I'm sorry. And you better start inviting my sister to all your dumb parties. I can't give you a guarantee. All right, then it's broken. No! (sobbing) (playing "The Chicken Dance")   Come on! Keep up! What part of the chicken dance don't you understand? Tina, you're kind of getting an attitude. Hmm. Let me check the schedule for mouthing off to the party planner. No. Not on here. So zip your lips and shake your hips. Louise (in headset): Tina! Tina, can you hear me? Louise? Oh, Tina! Hey, hey! Tina: Where are you? I'm stuck inside Tammy's head! Yeah. This whole thing is just too much Tammy. Louise: No! I'm literally stuck inside Tammy's giant head. With Tammy! Get us out of here! Huh? How did you guys get up there? Are those boogers? That's funny. Thank you. Can you just get us down? Okay, I'll get the maintenance guy to... "Ladies choice dance with Justin." What? Oh, I mean, it's just that next on the schedule is ladies choice dancing with Justin. So? And if we want to stay on schedule... No, no, no, no. ...I probably should keep filling in for Tammy. It's what she would've wanted. No! Tina! Get us out of here right now! I want my Bat Mitzvah back! Um... (imitates static) Uh-oh, you guys are starting to break up. (static) I can't hear you. Louise: You're terrible at making static sounds, Tina. Get us down! Tammy: Give me back my party, you psycho! (imitating static) I'm losing you guys. (static) I'm not a psycho. Louise: Tina, don't do th... (gasps) Hi, Aunt Frida. Frida: Hi, Other Tammy. Tammy: Your single white female sister is out of control! What do we do? I don't know, Tammy, I hate her, too! Plan B. And what is that? Going back to your plan A. Jump till this thing breaks open! Go! You got it! (grunting, yelling) Louise: Oh, my little legs! Justin, it's time for your ladies choice dance with Tammy. But since she's still taking Tammy time, we found you another partner and it is me. Um, but... Can't talk... there's a schedule. Hey! This burger isn't cooked! You want this food cooked, you go put it in a sink and run it under hot water. All right. Good! I don't have time to run all this food under hot water. Who's next? It's time for the Bat Mitzvah lady and the gentleman of her choice to take the dance floor. That's us.   What's Tina doing out there? Becoming a woman. Oh. The hand wants what the hand wants. I can't tell where your back ends and your butt begins. Oh, there it is. I was just too high. (grunting) That's my song! She's doing my dance! (growls) (Tammy screams, guests gasp) Oh, my God! Lower the Tammy head! (whirring) Uh-oh. We've been looking for you! Honey, are you okay? Hold on. Hold on, let me put down my drink. You! Justin, what are you doing? I'm not Tammy! Get my hands off your upper butt. The ball is over, Fake-erella. Tina, what the hell? (growling) I was stuck in there with that and you did nothing! Why didn't you rescue us? Um, I guess I got a little swept up in my role. Yeah, you think?! The power of the Bat Mitzvah is intoxicating. It's like a religious experience. Tammy, they don't get it. But I do. We do. I guess we do. Thanks for coming to my Bat Mitzvah. (snarling) Um... Time for the hora, everyone! The hora! (band playing "Hava Nagila") The hora! This isn't over, Tina! Oh, my God. See, this is what happens when we cater. We better get out of here before we get chased out. Let's go back to the wedding. Ooh, I want to sign the guest book. Sorry we left you, Gene. I'm not! It was easy. You make it seem so difficult. Once you stop using the grill, it's fast. For my Bat Mitzvah, I just want a gift certificate. Louise, you're not getting a Bat Mitzvah. I know. Because I'm getting a gift certificate. Mazel tov, Tammy!  Uru akhim be-lev sameakh  Uru akhim be-lev sameakh  Uru akhim be-lev sameakh  Uru akhim be-lev sameakh  Uru akhim  Be-lev sameakh  Hava nagila, hava nagila  Hava nagila ve-nismekha  Hava nagila, hava nagila  Hava nagila ve-nismekha  Hava neranenah, hava neranenah  Hava neranenah ve-nismekha... 
Linda: Oh, boy! Ah! Minutes away from a hotel weekend! You almost done, Teddy? Oh, right. The big burger meet-up. Yup. The first annual gathering of the North Atlantic Burger Lovers. It's also the first gathering of Bob and Linda's privates, in a hotel room, in years. (cackles) Uh-huh. That and BurgerBob finally gets to meet all his friends from the message board. Who's BurgerBob? Me. It's my online handle. So, just went with the first idea, huh? Where's the sitter? She's supposed to be here by now. I wanted to go over stuff. (phone line ringing) Hello? Jen, it's Linda Belcher. Did you forget you're watching the kids this weekend? No. Uh... wait. Yeah, I must have, because I'm in France with my family. Good-bye, Linda. Crap! Jen's in France. What are we gonna do? Gayle already said she can't watch the kids 'cause she's fostering a baby chick. Well, there's gotta be someone who can watch the kids. I'm someone. Well, we could call your cousin Vanessa. She's in a cult. What, people in a cult can't babysit? I'm not in a cult. Aw, come on. There's gotta be someone we're not thinking of. What about the checker from the grocery store? She said the kids were cute that one time. Oh, she smells awful! I think your kids are cute. I'd love to watch your kids. Teddy, have you ever babysat before? Nope. I bet I'd be good at it. And I wouldn't charge you guys anything. Uh, I don't... I don't think that... All right! Let's hit the friggin' road! What do you think of my walk? I'm trying something a little different. It's bold. Mm, mm. Whoa. Looks like Reggie's Deli has a new delivery boy.  (engine revs, tires squeal) Tina: Cold cuts just got hot. Welcome home, kids. How was your day? Teddy?! What are you doing here? You're not Jen. I'm, uh, watching you children while your mommy and daddy are out of town. Why are you babysitting? 'Cause it'll be fun. How much are they paying you? Nothing. Really? Yikes. Uh, we'll be doing many fun things this weekend, including dinner, roughhousing... not too rough... brushing teeth and going to bed. Think of me as the cool uncle you never had. Maybe call me T.J. Probably not. So... what kind of TV are we gonna watch? I don't know. Do you like The Mentalist? Who likes The Mentalist? Hands are going up. Hands are not going up. Uh... oh, boy. This isn't going like I thought it would. Bob: Hello. We have a reservation under "Belcher." Or maybe under "BurgerBob," my online name. Yes. Are you folks here for the burger conference, I'm assuming... BurgerBob? We... definitely are, yes. Okay. Mm. As well as a little hubby and wife getaway. You know, bubble baths and just touchin'... feelin'... lovin'... room service... chocolate... wink, wink. Oh... Sorry, we don't have those things. Oh. But the welcome cocktail party starts now in the Sunset Lounge and your name badge is good for a complimentary drink. Wonderful. Now, I did want to ask: Do you have a fax machine? We don't have a fax machine, either. (groans) I wanted to fax this to the kids. Mmm... Now what? Can't fax. All right. We'll just do it Monday. We'll do it... Yeah, Monday it'll have to be. That's where it's all gonna happen. Mm. A little small, a little rinky-dink, huh? Except for that tub of mayo. Gross. It's bad. What? It's a bad attitude. Hey, JustGrillin'. I-It's me, BurgerBob. Oh. Hey. Linda, this is JustGrillin', he's one of the guys on the burger forum. Hi, JustGrillin'. We're chillin' with JustGrillin'. (chuckles) Yeah, that's my wife. So, we're just gonna drop our bags off in the room. We'll catch you and the gang at the welcome party. Yeah... okay. Isn't BurgerBob the guy you were talking about? Yes. Oh, my God. I got to text BeeferSutherland. Ah, back from the bathroom. Was there a lull? What's going on? What are we doing? Just watching TV. All right. So... no takers on checkers? Or Chinese checkers? No checkers for me tonight. Okay, I'm just gonna fix the kitchen sink. I noticed it's draining kind of slow. Have fun. What'd you say? Oh, I said, "Ha-Have..." I think we just said, "Have fun." We'll-we'll be here. Yeah. Oh, okay. What you got there? Oh, this? A plumber's snake. To clear out the pipe. (whirring) Whoa! Oh. What's the holdup with those chips? Whoa, what am I looking at?  There's a clog in there  And it could be underwear.  What will it find? Goop? Probably some goop. Hey, guys, what are we doing for dinner? Oh, I know. How about sandwiches from Reggie's Deli? Great. I'll pick them up. Bye. Hey, Reggie. Four sandwiches, please. You got it. Uh, what you want on them? What? Uh, you know, I need to know cheeses, meats. That sort of thing. Oh, uh, surprise me. Okay. That for here or to go? Um, for delivery? Delivery? But you're here. Just make the sandwiches, Reggie. Okay, I-I'm making it, making the sandwiches. It's okay. Here we go. Here we go. Hey, Jonas, you got another delivery. Mm, mm, mm. Jonas. Cool keyboard. My brother uses his to make fart sounds. (groans) It's not a keyboard. It's a melodica. But, hey, why am I talking about it, when I could be doing this? (playing melodica) Well, get a melod-a-you. See ya. Back at my house! That's where your next delivery is. Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on. If I'm delivering this to your house, why don't you just hop on? That's a good idea that I never thought of until you just said it. (quietly): It's happening. You don't have to hold me so tight. Oh, this isn't tight. I'm so hungry, I'm so hungry. Food's here! And, Teddy, I don't know if this will interest you, but Tina is riding on a d*ath machine with a stranger. Tina, what are you doing on the back of a motorbike? It's okay. I wore a helmet. Right, but still. Just seems like it's a gray area between bicycle and motorcycle. I don't know how I should react. (quietly): Ground her. And give me all of her stuff. Next time, put a helmet on the food. My sandwich top is askew! Askew! Well, come on up soon, Tina. It's dinnertime. (sarcastically): Psh, cool dad. Oh, thanks, but he's not my dad. He's a regular in our restaurant, and he's watching us for the weekend 'cause my parents are out of town. Wait, wait, wait. Your parents are out of town and you've got your very own restaurant? You're a really good listener. We should have a gathering here. Tonight. We should? Uh, of course we should. I don't think I'm allowed to have a party. It's a gathering. Where like-minded young adults come together and just gather, you know? I guess I know. I'll be there, right? That's not too bad, right? Uh-huh. I'll bring my hair. Yeah. Okay. I punch out in an hour. 60 minutes. And I'll tell my friends to swing by. Um, okay. Hey, you good at catching things? Not really. Well, get good, so you can catch this. (kissing sound, blows) Caught it. No, wait, I think I dropped it. See ya! Damn it. Won't start. (grunts) Don't look at me. (grunts) I'll try not to. No promises. You know, these people are more than just online usernames that I share burger tips with. It's a community. They're my people. Okay, save it for your friends, honey. Hey, Beefgeek. You look exactly like I thought you would. Meatcute! There she is! (muttering) Oh, not a hugger. That's fine. So here we are, finally getting together in person. Party started! You know what we should do? Shots! I'll get 'em! Don't let him ruin your weekend. No, no, I'm gonna say something. Hey! BeeferSutherland, it's me, BurgerBob! So where's your oversized luggage? What? What-what are you talking about? Because you must have needed the world's biggest suitcase to lug your gigantic balls here. Beefer, I'm totally lost here. I'm saying it took big balls to show up at this conference. Big balls! Big balls? I-I don't have those. Why wouldn't I show up here? Maybe because all your posts are either crapping on us amateurs or you're bragging about your flashy restaurant. That's crazy. I-I don't... I don't do that. Mm-hmm. I asked how to get rust off a cast-iron skillet. And you say, "Don't let it get rust in the first place." All caps! What a jerk. I was just kidding around. Then why didn't you write "LOL" or "JK" or use an emoticon? Oh, I-I don't know how to use those things. Oh, come on! And trust me, my-my restaurant isn't flashy. We've got a funeral home on one side of us and I think on the other side is a guy that sells indoor outhouses. I bought one of those! Oh. Why? Because it's cheaper than... Never mind. Let's get out of here before BurgerBob yells at us with his caps lock key. Wait, I... Blocked. (humming) Oh, hey, where'd everyone go? Nobody likes me. Sure, they do. Have a sh*t. You'll feel better. I don't feel like a sh*t, Lin. No, do a sh*t. It makes you more fun. People'll like you. I don't want to do shots. I paid for five shots, we're doing five shots. Go. Wolf it. (gulping) Ooh, we hooked something big. (sniffs) You smell that? It's vile. Yeah. But so vile you want to suck it into your lungs, right? (inhales deeply) Ah, you gettin' that? (inhales) Ah! (grunting) What is that, sulfur? Is that Satan? It's putting up a fight. (grunts) Give me a hand here. (all grunting) Ah! It's magnificent. Ah... It really is. Tina! We're bonding like crazy in here. Be part of it. Oh, yeah. That's great. So, I'm gonna go down to the restaurant and do some homework. It's Friday night. It's time to party. Grab the bathroom scale... let's weigh this thing. Maybe after I knock out this pesky homework, huh? What are you, a bookworm? Huh? Have fun. Who wants to taste it? Me! And then I want to name it and raise it like it's our own. Tina: Maybe they won't come. Maybe that's for the best. I really do have homework to do. Hey, little girl, psst. You. It's Tina. Right. Well, uh, come on in. I'm totally comfortable with having you all here. (scoffs) This place is kind of lame, right? Yeah, let's get out of here. Great gathering, Jonas. It's the leaky gazebo all over again. No, wait. Hey. Free burgers isn't lame, right? Um, I'm really not allowed to light the grill by myself. I could go for a cheeseburger. Cheeseburger for Marco, Tina? Huh? Uh... Huh? (sighs) Okay. I'll fire up the grill. Cool, cool. Oh, hey. Did someone order some tunes? I don't think so. An-Anyone order tu... (playing melodica) Oh, you were just... I'm likable. Yeah... I know I am! No, you have friends. The kids like me, Teddy likes me. Right, Teddy. Teddy likes you. My dad hates me. Not that again. Uh, what the... They just threw an olive at me. (laughter) You can't get away from my olives. Bobby, screw those burger nerds. Let's go check out the Jacuzzi. It's open till 9:45... (sighs) That's nice. Isn't it? See? Even if we don't have room service or a fax machine and everyone at the hotel hates you, we can still have a romantic getaway. Oh, no, not you guys. Come on, Beefer, let's just come back later. And let BurgerBob win? No way. I showered and everything. We'll just sit here and wait. Well, you're gonna be waiting a long time, 'cause we're just getting comfy. Myeh, myeh, myeh. Uh, yeah. This Jacuzzi is for... members of the Jacuzzi forum only. That's not a thing. You just made that up. No, I didn't. And you are blocked.  Hey  Whoo!  La-la-la-la-la-la-la- la-la-la-la-la-la-la.    A nice thick layer of chocolate squares make up the base. A couple of handfuls of crushed pretzels. Top it all off with marshmallows, and... Whoa! Voila! Teddy Brulee. Finally, arson and food together! Hey, Teddy, can I play with that blowtorch? I just want to inspect it, you know, learn about it. Yeah, sure. Here you go. (melodica playing) Hold on. You hear that? Nope. Sounds like an accordion but worse? Nope, in your head. Nope, it's something downstairs. No, in your head upstairs. (playing off-key) Sorry, folks, private party. Yeah? I-I think we're on the list. Right, Tina? Uh... yeah. Tina, Tina, Tina. You're supposed to be the good one. Somewhere there's a convenience store parking lot worried sick about these teens. Tina, come on, you're putting me in a tough spot. I'm sure you're not allowed to have friends down here this late at night. Dude, with that kind of attitude, you're only going to raise your blood pressure to unsafe levels. Don't lecture me about my blood pressure! I'm predisposed to like salty foods. Out! Everybody out of my friend's restaurant! Oh, my God. Teddy, could you embarrass me any more? Oh, that's a great question, and the answer is yes. Please start. Please start. (grunting, engine starts) Oh, thank God. Let's just go to the cove. The cove? It's the cove by the lighthouse. Come by if you want. I know that place. It's the cove by the lighthouse. And, uh, hey, if you come, uh, bring some burgers with you? Here's a little one. Got it. Little mouth burger. We just got our goop baby to sleep and we have to come downstairs to deal with this? We are very disappointed. Tina, I have no idea what's gotten into you. You can't stop what's happening. Jonas likes me and he invited me out with his friends, and I want to go! Sorry, Tina. You're 13 years old, it's 9:00, you're in for the night. My temporary house, my temporary rules. You don't like it? There's the door that you can't go out! I hate your temporary rules! Shh-shh-shh- shh-shh. You're not my dad, Teddy. Or my mom. Or my uncle. And I don't think you're my godfather. I don't think I have one. I'm coming, Jonas! You're right, box. The ladder did install in less than 30 seconds. (winded): Hey, guys. I made it. Now it's a party. And I brought burgers. Nice! Not from our restaurant, 'cause I couldn't get the key. Hey, that melodica's not gonna play itself. Oh, yeah. No. No. Oh, great. Clay: No, no, no... (playing off-key) Wow, it's almost like music. (phone ringing) Belcher residence. Teddy, it's Bob. Wait, I called your cell phone. Why'd you say Belcher residence? (spits) Just to be respectful. How's the conference going? Uh, it's... complicated. How's it going over there? It's complicated. What? Teddy, I can say it's complicated. You can't say it's complicated. You're watching my kids. Sorry, Bob. So is it complicated, Teddy? No, it's great. You want to talk to the kids? Eh, not really. You sure? No, yeah. I can put 'em on. Yeah, go... Yeah, all right. Okay. (snores) Louise is asleep. Gene's asleep. And Tina's... aah! Asleep. Uh, Tina's asleep, Bobby. All right, well, let her sleep. Okay. We'll talk to them in the morning. All right, well, I'll... I'll happily put on Tina if you want to talk to her right now, Bobby. No, it's all right. Let her sleep. I will wake her up with a bucket of water and a cowbell if that's gonna make you happy, Bobby. You want to talk to your daughter, you got it. Teddy. It's okay. Stop. I'm hanging up now. Go to bed. Yeah. Okay. Oh, this is bad. This is terrible! Aah! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Louise: Hey, you woke us up. What gives, Teddy? We need our sleep. We're so little. Tina's missing, Louise! (yawns) More like kissing. You know. (gasps) Jonas! The sandwich boy. Ugh. The sign says to limit your soak time to 15 minutes! That sign says, "No running," and you're running your mouth, MeatCute! I bought these trunks for this conference. I'm not bringing 'em home dry! They're gonna be damp at the very least. Screw these guys. Let's just get in there with 'em. Like hell you will! (grunts) (whimpers) Back it up! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Easy now! Oh, no, you don't. Hey, hey, hey! My wife and I never get a weekend away! Hey, don't touch me. This is all the vacation we have left, and you're not getting it! I'll go right, you go left. Mm-hmm. Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Ooh, splashing. Good idea! I know! (grunting) (laughs) Ah, excuse me. Excuse me. What is going on here? Stay out of this! Give me that. These people are jabbing us and harassing us. And they've been in there for an hour! An hour? That's crazy. (panting) We just got here. Oh, really? Hmm. Pruny. I've had a bad feeling about you two ever since check-in. That's it. Please exit the hot tub so these people may enjoy it. Fine. Okay, we'll leave. Really? Yeah. We're all grown-ups here. Thank you. Bye-bye, BurgerBob. (all sigh) Oh, that jet is right on my back. Oh, that's a lumbar paradise. I trust your conference is going well, otherwise. I'm not completely dissatisfied. Hmm. (Bob and Linda yelling) Huh? Hope you like your Jacuzzi with extra relish! Aah! And mayo! (all groaning) L.O.L. Laugh on loudly! And post. That's it. I'm calling security. (groaning) Good, we're leaving anyway. Yeah. And get a fax machine. Desk Clerk: Oh, go fax yourself! (melodica playing) Clay: Stop. Stop. Stop, Jonas. No one likes that except the girl, and she's probably had enough, right? It's okay, I guess. Stop if you want to stop, though. What about, um... Let's break into the lighthouse and, uh, make shadow puppets onto the fog. Eh. Ugh. Well, no one else is coming up with ideas, Marco. I'll break into the lighthouse with you without the melodica. How do we get in? Through that window up there. One of us can go in and then unlock the front door for the rest of us. Terrible plan. Seriously, Clay? Yeah, seriously, Clay? It looks like a tight squeeze. I'll do it. I can fit. Uh, okay, sure. I'll give you a boost. You've got strong arms. Must be from delivering all those sandwiches. Yeah. Uh, can you reach the window? Uh, I have to step on your head. Ow! Ow! (Louise grunting) (thudding, siren toots) Cops! Run! (yelling) (panting) Wait! Jonas, wait for me! (Louise groans) Gotcha. All right, come on out! Oh, this isn't my house. What the hell were you doing in the lighthouse, young lady? I was gonna make shadow puppets to amuse the ships at sea? Oh, you think this is funny? Some ship sees a huge dog in the fog?! I don't know how to make a dog! Everybody knows how to make a dog! Oh. Yeah. (birds screeching) All right, smart-ass, let's call your parents so they can pick you up. My parents are out of town. Well, looks like you'll be spending the night at the station. Uh, the police station? No, the ranger station. It's the same, but we have a foosball table. Reggie! Reggie! Open up! You can't wait till morning for a nice sandwich? My oldest temporary niece Tina ran off with your delivery boy. I'm not blaming you, but I'm blaming you! Where are they, Reggie? Where are they?! Jonas would sell you out in a hot second! You can't even look us in the eyes! Where are they, Reggie? Well, for a while, him and his friends liked to hang out in my gazebo, but then, one night, it rains, and it leaks a tiny bit, and they wouldn't shut up about it. Like I'm the jerk. Now I think they go to the cove by the lighthouse. Come on, let's go! Wait, I want to see this gazebo. The gazebo that cold cuts built! No, no, no, no, no, we got no time for gazebos. Okay, we'll take a quick look. Go out! I'm dumping sand on you. Go out! Excuse me, Officer. Have you seen a bunch of teenagers around here? They're of the dorky variety. Yup. I apprehended one of them. Tina! Hi, Teddy. Oh, you know this girl? Yes, I do. I'm her weekend guardian. Well, I caught her trespassing in the lighthouse. You got to let her go, Officer. I could do that, or I could let her spend the night behind bars. No, no, no! Li-Listen, Ranger Dainko... Is it Ranger Dainko? What's your first name? Matthew. Matthew Dainko. That's a pretty name. Look, I've only been an uncle for a day. I guess I couldn't handle the job. If anyone should spend the night in teen ranger jail, it should be me. It's not teen ranger jail, it's just ranger jail. Look, maybe she didn't do the right thing tonight, but she's got heart, this one, and she follows it. She's just a mixed up kid who's going through a ton of puberty right now. Am I right, Tina? Yes. And then some. Well, it's not that simple. There's a form involved... two signatures and an initial. You got to sign here. Okay. And again here. Right. And initial here. Right. Okay. So, just anywhere? No, where it says guardian. So... at the bottom? No, on-on the line. So just anywhere on the form? Just write... No not on the... anywhere. Oh? Just... okay, just never mind! Forget it! I was so worried about you, Tina. I'm sorry, Teddy. I shouldn't have snuck out. Thanks for getting me out of ranger danger. I don't think I would have made it in the joint. Jonas, you came back for me! Uh... yeah. And this. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You didn't come back for Tina. You came back for your moped. You used Tina for free burgers, then you hung her out to dry when Ranger Matthew Dainko came. Oh, God, you did, didn't you? She's too good for you! But good enough for a lot of guys! Which makes you the worst, Jone-ass! Okay, I'll keep that in mind as I ride away. (engine sputters, Jonas groans) Oh, no, you don't. (groans) Hey! Nobody... messes... with my... temporary niece! Aah! Yeah! No! Oh. Oh, that's bad. Tell you what. Instant regret. I cannot believe I did that. Talk about losing your cool, Teddy. You're gonna have a lot to talk about this week in therapy! Right? Eh. "Did you lose your cool?" "A little bit, doc. A little bit I lost my cool." Hey, we should call Teddy and let him know we're coming home early. (beep) (phone ringing) Hello. Teddy. Hey, it's Linda. You're on speakerphone. Hey, Teddy. The conference was a bust. We're coming home early. Oh, goodie. How early is early? Ah, we'll be home in 15 minutes. Okay, great! Your parents are 15 minutes away. If we hurry, we can beat 'em home and jump in bed and pretend nothing happened. Bob: Teddy? Yeah? We just heard everything you said. No, you didn't. I had it on mute. You didn't. No, I-I definitely tried to press it. Wait, wait, wait. Are you at the beach? No. We can see you. That's them right there. That's them. Oh, yeah. Hey, Bobby. What is that kid doing in the water? (grunting) Rescuing a drowning moped. Oh, God, it's late. Bedtime, kids! Bedtime! Anything you say, Uncle Teddy.  Hey  Whoo! 
Mmm... (smacking lips) Mmm... You gotta wrap it up, Teddy. We're closing for the afternoon, but we'll be back in a few hours for the dinner rush. (doorbell jingles) I'm ready! Let's go! Why do you have two bottles of wine? What? It's a wine train. Ooh. You guys going on the wine train? Uh, you get the wine on the train, Lin. You don't have to bring it. Oh... Otherwise, it would be just called a train. Right. Lin, you're sure kids are allowed on this thing? It says right here in the brochure, "Kids are allowed." It says, "Kids are allowed, "but not welcome." Like in the health and sexuality section at the bookstore. Where's Gene? He's picking out his outfit. (doorbell jingles) I'm gonna be Boxcar Gene! Gene, why do you look like Dexy from Dexy's Midnight Runners? 'Cause we're going on a train! Well, go put a shirt on. Next thing, you're gonna be telling me to go put on underwear. Put on underwear. Okay. (bell clanging) You folks will be seated right here in passenger car one with the big grapes. And I'm gonna take these little raisins back to the end of the vine. Bye, Mom. Bye! (gasps) Louise: Whoa! It's the biggest chocolate fountain on a train in North and South America. The world's biggest is in Guatemala. I did not know chocolate came from fountains. I want to put my head in it. And my feet. Ethan, thank you very much for the guided tour. Uh, looks like we'll be setting up shop here for the day. For your troubles. Uh-uh, no-no-no-no-no, no-no-no... no. Oh, here you go, one more for you. Uh, kids... no. I'm sorry. Okay, one more for you. Oh. Ye... actually, uh... Thank you, Ethan. if you could put that down. Kids aren't allowed anywhere near the buffet, or the passenger cars. But you are absolutely welcome to... the Juice Caboose! Ugh, what a dump. Hey, there's someone there. (grunting, gasping) (gasps, wheezes) Regular Sized Rudy? Louise, Gene, Tina... what are you doing here? Hold on, Beanbag, I'll be right back. I know these guys from school. Um... do you live here? My dad has me on the weekends. He's been online dating and he brings his dates here. But, on the bright side, I get to hang out with ol' Beanbag here. Up top, Beanbag. Boom! Yep. We see a lot of Rudy. (both laughing awkwardly) Okay... rules: One, you can't leave the Juice Caboose for the duration of the trip. Two, don't bother me. And three, uh... always believe in yourself. Thanks. We can't leave the Juice Caboose? Are you kidding me?! Get comfy, 'cause this room is your life for the next four hours. But there's nothing to do! Open this door! (imitates train chugging) I can't hear you! The train's too loud... honk, honk. Honk, honk?! Trains don't make that noise! (train whistle blows) (screaming) (screams) Bob: All right, this is gonna be great. We have a babysitter and a lot of alcohol. Wait, don't do... No, don't do it! It's a tasting. You're supposed to swirl it around and shake the glass to open it up, or something. Like this: Hey, open up, wine! Linda's coming in. (smacking goofily) Uh, okay. Well, you do that. I'm just gonna drink a lot of wine. (man slurping nearby) (gargling) That guy must really know what he's doing. Why, because he's slurping? Mm... Ugh! Oh, my. Excuse me! Hey! Hi! Are you some kind of an expert? I just overheard you doing that sound... Oh. I'm a wine enthusiast. Although I'm not enthused by this first flight. (laughs): Oh! He's hysterical. (sighs) You should come taste with us. Oh! You can give us tips on how to get tipsy. Sure. Lin, no. I don't want to drink with that guy. Why? I do, Bobby. He's an expert. Well, I was looking forward to a relaxing day off. I wasn't even gonna talk to you that much, to be honest. I just don't want to drink with the guy... Hi... Look who's here? I'm Rick. I love ltalian wines, German cars and Japanese women. I'm Linda! I love showers and mornings and bologna and turtles. And wine! I'm Bob. Well, it looks like we are going to be a tasting trio for the afternoon. Jambo. It means cheers. Cheers! Or, as we say: "Cheers!" Come on, Bob. If we don't clink, it's not a real Jambo. Mm-hmm. Jambo! Jambo. Jambo...! Jambo...! Jambo...! Uh, okay. Rick: Jambo...! Linda: Jambo...! Bob: No more Jambo. Usually I'm by myself, but since you guys are here, maybe we could take turns sitting on Beanbag. Is that okay with you, Beanbag? Rudy, how can you just sit there, when there's a chocolate fountain behind this door being unappreciated by a bunch of drunk adults? It's being wasted on the wasted! There's got to be a way out of here. There's a hatch in the ceiling. Here, give me a boost. (Gene and Tina grunting) Ahh...! It's hot! Bad idea! Bad idea! Put me down! Gene: Okay. Thank you. (sighs) Okay. Nobody panic. We're only in here for two hours. Four hours. (screams) (screaming): Four hours! "Four hours...!" (Linda and Rick slurping) (both continue slurping, groaning) (gargling, slurping) Oh, my God. You know, if you ever want to get serious about wine, you really have to lose the mustache. True, 'cause it gets all caught up in there. Mm-hmm. That makes sense. Yeah. Not to mention: Pee-ew! Be a lot easier if you just shaved it. I'd rather not, Rick. I'm not shaving it. I didn't bring shaving equipment. Bobby, quit being a pinot grouchio! (both laughing) (weak laugh) Look, I'm perfectly happy enjoying my wine, staring out the window at that... kid on a bike, going the same speed as us? And we are friends. I call him Ramon. Hi, Ramon! (muffled): What? Hi! (muffled): I can't hear you. What? I... I can't hear you. I'm in a train. Okay, have a nice bike ride. (rock clinks, both gasp) Whoa. Ramon just threw a rock at me. We're still friends. (train chugging) What kind of God would put a chocolate fountain on a train and not let kids near it?! Yeah! Learn how to build a train, God! Well... the chocolate fountain is impressive, but the real supply's all the way up front. What do you mean, "The real supply?" There's way more chocolate up in the kitchen. I've seen them load boxes and boxes of it in there. Well, then, are you guys thinking what I'm thinking? That I need a bath? Oh, yeah. You do. No. We break out of here and steal the chocolate from the front of the train! I'd do that. Gene: I'm in. Great! The Belcher kids ride again! For the first time! And Rudy! Is there. Louise: Okay, if we're gonna rob this train, we need to take it step by step. Luckily, Rudy has been trapped in this caboose for the last nine weekends doing some serious recon. I see everything out this window. Once, a skunk got on the train for a little bit and then it got off and I was the only one to notice. Just take us through the logistics, Train Brain. Okay. Each of these blocks is a train car. This is taking too long! I need chocolate! Gene, quiet. Sorry. It's okay. Now, this is us here in the Juice Caboose. I can see us in there. Just kidding. We're not inside a block. Tina! Okay. The only time the door to the caboose in unlocked, is when Ethan makes a juice box delivery, every hour on the hour. Gene: Every hour on the hour. Sounds like a robot. Wait! What if Ethan is a robot!? Gene! Focus! You guys are embarrassing me. In front of Rudy, which is hard! Even if we get out of here, you still have to get all the way up to the kitchen car. The chocolate is kept inside the chocolatier's refrigerator. He's from Germany. The chocolate's from Switzerland. We're from America. Gene: Yeah...! Rudy: Now, the only time the kitchen is empty is when it's a passenger's birthday and the whole staff comes out to sing the "Chugga Chugga Choo Choo Happy Birthday To You" song. So, we know how to get in, but how do we get out? I think I know how, but it's a little dangerous. Like sandwiches with toothpicks in them dangerous? Even more dangerous than that. Like eating a b*mb? In between. Like eating a firecracker. Yeah. Okay. Here's what we're gonna do. Well... aren't you kids playing nice. Hey, Ethan, over here. Look at my face and hands while I'm talking. I just want you to know it's my mom's birthday today. Um, it isn't June 3, it's today. Okay. Wait, I have some questions for you. Ethan: Uh-huh. Um, what does "Ethan" mean? Um... Sounds like how Shakespeare would say "eating." Ethan: Huh? Tina: So, maybe that's where it comes from? Yeah. I don't know. Maybe. Next question, uh... if a train leaves New York at 4:00, and another train leaves Dallas at 5:00, what time will they meet? Ethan: Uh... Great. Well, I'm kind of busy right now, so I'm gonna have to let you go. Have fun at my mom's birthday. Bye. Uh... do you want juice?! No! Uh, maybe... uh, ye... no, ye... ahh...! Mm. I like this one. Ugh! You think you do, but you don't. What do I think of this wine? Great question. Here's what you think. Hey, Ethan. How's Rudy? How's Beanbag? Uh, they're great. Beanbag's great. Rudy's such a delight. I just dropped off some juice for them. (chuckles) Can I get a cranberry juice? (whispering): Uh-oh... Coming right up. Um, who's Rudy? He's my son. Mandy: You have a son? Mandy, you know, I might have left a little information off my E-Kiss profile, but that was just for readability. So, you look nothing like your profile picture and you have a son? Uh-huh. Mandy: Okay. Sylvester: So, your face is saying one thing... Mandy: No. No. I love kids. Sylvester: Okay. Will you ma... I love kids. Can you make eye contact with me? I am. Aren't I? No. You're looking at my chin. No. That's, that's your... I'll just get below here. How 'bout now? No. Na... I have a son. Are you cool with that? I gotta take a nap. Okay. Whew! Oh, there it is. Here you go. (nervously chuckles) We've got a birthday, people. Places. Ready? Here we go, everyone. Five, six, seven and... All (reciting): Everybody watch your back the birthday train is on the track! Well, hello, there. (reciting in rhythm): Put some wine in your glass, (laughing) 'cause your life is moving fast, so drink your day away. Honk, honk! What's happening?! It's not my... Happy Birthday, Linda! Oh, it is my birthday... (applause) Don't worry, I'm gonna get you out of here. (high-pitched): Yay! (normal voice): And then I'm gonna eat you. (high-pitched): No...!   (normal voice): Shush! Where is she? She should be out there by now! (door latch clicks) Who's that? I don't know... it's too early for Ethan to come back. Aah! I'm not decent! Come back later! Thank you! (in German accent): I must use the kerplunker! There's a line for the other one. Make it fast. Don't tell me, make it fast. (gently): Just go. Don't tell me, just go. Just da... ah... Make some noise. Sing songs or something. Look, look... look at the legs on the glass. You see the legs? I see fe... it looks like feet. Oh, Linda. You're such a sweet, simple person. Thanks. Wait, what? Look, Rick, you're not the only person with taste. We happen to own a restaurant. Whoa-ho! It's not a competition, Bob. I didn't say it was. Sounds like this guy wants to have a wine-off! What?! (gasps) Wine-off? Ooh, wine-off. Wine-off. Wine-off. There's gonna be a wine-off. We got a wine-off! Oh, my goodness. It's going down. Hey... oh, s... Sorry, sorry. Uh, da, da, da. Too soon? Too... too much? Don't. Yeah, just... My space. I thought the train was crashing. Sorry. Trying to save you. Whew. Okay, this is scarier than I thought. Uh, no big deal, Louise. Just jump off a moving train. (sighs anxiously) Come on. One, two, three! Wow. That train is not moving very fast. (grunting) This window won't open. That's why we need to get back in there. Could pick up the pace. You're not going fast enough. Chocolatier: I am too going fast enough. No job is done until the paperwork is complete. Stand by. Where the hell is Rudy? (toilet flushes) Okay. Oh, boy! Oh, oh... Oh, wow... It's not that bad. You're making a big deal. Wow. You're making... Come on. It's like my grandpa. It's not that bad. Where the hell have you been? Pull me up. Hand me the chocolate and then I'll pull you up. Hand you the chocolates? Yeah. And then I'll pull you up. How do I know that once I hand you the chocolate you're not gonna just leave me out here and take the chocolate? I wouldn't do that. That's what I would do. That's so mean. Look, if you don't take this chocolate and leave me out here, then I can't work with you. Please give me the chocolate so I can pull you up. Fine. (grunts) Okay, Gene. You hold onto me. Got it. Tina, you hold onto me. Great. And then I'll hold onto something in the bathroom. And pretend it's a person holding onto me. Like a boy or an 18-year-old boy. Okay. We're ready. Ah... no. (screaming) (panting, grunting) Bang-up job, everybody. We got the chocolate in the caboose. Like we planned. The only problem is is that we are not in the caboose! At least we have toilet paper. You guys want any? Thank you. Louise: Ugh! Well, we're stranded. Our chocolate's on the train, and there's nothing around here for miles. My boy-dar isn't picking up anything, either. Oh, wait... no, that's a deer. We've got to get back to that chocolate before somebody else does. Guys, we're gonna be okay. The train's coming right back here. Wait, what? The train goes down, goes around Lake Waste Water, and comes right back. It should back in 15 minutes, so we should just jump on it. But when is Ethan gonna stop by the Juice Caboose with his next delivery? Let me check my watch. In exactly... (gasps) 15 minutes! This is gonna be close. Mmm. Speak to me. You're hiding from me. (chuckling) I'll find you. Ooh... (chuckles) You have got a lot goin' on here, girl. Ugh. Ah, there you are. A California Central Coast Syrah. Okay, Bobby. Now you taste your wine. This one is probably... wine. I would say red. Or it could be white. I'm also realizing that I'm not as good at this as I thought I'd be. No, you're not. Chablis is a wine, right? You guys aren't answering me. I'm gonna say that's a good sign. I'm going with Chablis. Oh, I'm sorry, Bobby. You're not good at this. Poor Bob. I can't see your sad, pathetic face right now, but I bet it's crying. I'll tell you what. Linda, pick any wine. It can even be a wine he knows. Any wine? If you can get one wine right, just one, you win the whole competition. In fact, you could pick a wine he had last night. I'll still know it before he does. Ooh, bonus round. Whoever says what it is first, wins. (sighs) What's the point? You can do this, Bobby. No, I can't. Look at me, Bobby. I-I can't. Yes you can. I have a blindfold on. Well, you can do the mystery wine. All right, fine. Pour it. At least I'll get drunk-ish. That's it, Bobby. Tina: Hey, look what's coming around the mountain. The train. Just kidding about the mountain, uh, but the train is... remember that song? Uh-oh. Guys, she's coming back faster. This only happens when the train's running behind schedule or this one time when they ran out of rosé and things got weird. Gene: It's starting to look kind of like a real train now. Like fast, and dangerous. We could just get a cab. Oh, look, there's Ethan. Louise: He's headed toward the Juice Caboose! We need to jump on now, guys. Come on. (all panting) Hobos do this everyday. I don't understand it. Cliff! You think my name is Cliff? Oh, my God, I love it. I'm Cliff now. Call me Cliff. No, just to clarify: Cliff! (screaming) Louise: We have to get on that train now! We're running out of dry land! (Louise panting, grunting) (gasps) I have to go back for my bandana. It's made of cotton! Leave it! Leave it! Oh, damn it! (Gene grunts) You chose chocolate. It's what your bandana would have wanted. Gene: I guess. (grunting) Oh, no. Now my overalls are stuck. What's going on with my outfit? Do something, Gene! He's almost here! Aah! We have to hide the chocolate. Oh... Where are we going to hide it? I don't know. (gasps) Oh, no. (Louise screams) RUDY: Oh, no! Oh, boy. Oh, oh... (kids grunting) Rudy: Oh, boy, oh, boy! Gene: Ow. Hey, kiddies. Got your juice. (panting) Oh, thanks, Ethan. Thanks so much, buddy. We can always count on you for juice and juice-related things and... really just juice. But we love juice. (gasps, pants) Are you kids okay? (wheezing): Oh, we're just great, thanks. Last juice of the day. Great. Uh, cran-apple? Wait a minute. Something's up. Why are you out of breath? Well, my trachea constricts due to histamines that my body produces... Okay, okay, Rudy, stop talking. Why are your shoes muddy? Because I'm-I'm poor. Oh, I'm so poor. And why are you in your underwear? Because I am rich. There's been a burglary. Somebody stole my chocolate! I am very shocked by that. Okay, what was rule number two? Always believe in yourself? No! Don't bother me. Stealing is bothering. Nobody steals anything on my shift. Yeah! Wha... we've been locked in here all day. I don't buy it. I don't buy it, either. I think I know who likes chocolate. Everybody. Yes, right. But especially kids. I heard this one say she wants to put her face and her feet in it. I stand by that. It's gotta be in here somewhere. Would you be dumb enough to hide it in here? I guess you're dumb enough to think we would hide it in there, Ethan. Yeah, you gorgeous idiot. Or maybe you kids hid it in the bathroom. Whew...! Eh, maybe give it a minute in there. It's not in there. Get up, Rudy. N-No. Beans didn't do anything. He doesn't have a malicious bean in his bag. No! No! Don't you touch Beanbag! No! All right! Bonus round. Winner takes all. Ready... and drink. I know what it is. Oh, you know? From one sip. Yep. So Bob knows it. Say it. I'll give you a chance here. You take a guess. Oh, he's giving Rick a chance. You don't know it. Talk to me, Goose. Get inside me. Take your shoes off. Make yourself comfortable. The wine's inside of Rick. Getting comfortable. Okay. It's a blend... Yeah, it's definitely a blend. I'm getting a few things here. It's very complex. Take another sip, Rick. This is gettin' good. Oh, I guess I was wrong. I hope you're happy. He was beautiful. Well, whatever. Enjoy the rest of your ride. I'll go check the busboys. Somebody has the chocolate. Hey, uh... I'm sorry you kids had to see that. But, uh... it's a hard life on the rails. Yup, yup, so true. So wise. You should teach a class. Bye! I should. You guys sure you don't want any more juice? We don't want any more juice. Get out of here, Ethan. Okay, okay. See you next week, Rudy. We cool? Yeah, yeah. We're cool. Just go. All right. Doesn't sound like we're cool. We're cool! Okay, bye. Everybody, open your mouths. Delicious. It's so delicious. Num, num, num... Pace yourself. Pace yourself. (slurps) Who are you? I know we've met. You're embarrassing me. All right, Rick. Stop stalling. Fine. It's very viscous. It's a... Cab-Merlot blend. Okay, okay, okay. Bob, do you know what the wine is? It is a blend. But it's a blend of spit. Because it's from the spit bucket! What? He's right. Bobby wins. What?! You drank spit, Rick. You drank a lot of it. What? You poured that from the spit bucket? Why did you do that? Because I knew Bob would know what it was. Why would Bob know that? Because we went to see Sideways, and after that we went to the wine bar and I bet Bob he wouldn't drink from the spit bucket and he did. That's disgusting. (gags) And that's how you win a wine-off. Ah! (all gasping) Wine fight! (passengers laughing) No, no, no. Not the jacket. Not-not the turtleneck, it's cashmere. That's for lying on your profile. I'm sorry. Look, I'm a middle-aged man who's just trying to get back out there and... Mandy, I really like you. That's for making me fall for you. Aw, they're in love. Ah, my face! We got our very own chocolate fountain! Some of it just went down my underwear. I like it. This is the best weekend of my life. It doesn't even matter that I'm allergic to chocolate. Rudy, what? Ugh, stop eating it, then. Oh, 'cause I'm allergic to it? Yeah, what happens when you eat it? I don't know, I've never eaten it. I don't know what... (gags, chokes) Rudy! Rudy! Just kidding. Damn it, Rudy. It's not that bad. I just get a rash on my back. There's my babies. Why are you covered in chocolate? Why are you covered in wine? Don't ask questions. Yeah, ditto. Oh. I feel like I French-kissed the whole train. Uh... yum. Hey, Mom, did you have a nice birthday at least? I did. Wait, who told you it was my birthday? Oh, look, there's Ethan. He's yelling something. Louise: Oh, hey, Ethan, we found your chocolate. It's on our faces and in our tummies. No! Them! They did it. They took the chocolate! It was them, they took the chocolate!
(TV static) The burglar reportedly went in... (grunting) You gotta hit it just right. (grunts) Linda, please use the ladder, or at least let me do it. I'm fine, Bob. (grunts) Just gotta find the sweet spot. (grunts) Lin, I'm gonna come over and steady your legs. All right? (sighs) (whoops) There. You see? Got it. Have a little faith, you know? I'm not some clumsy idiot who can't... whoa! Linda... y-you okay? I'm fine, Bob, I just slipped. Ow! Damn it! (laughing) Ow. That l-looked like it hurt. It's not funny, Bob! Check, please. I know that sounds like I'm saying, "Check, please," but I actually should be going. So check, please. Uh-oh. My wallet is missing. Better start washing dishes. (laughing) I hope I didn't lose it. I'd hate to have my identity stolen. I'm sure they'd give it right back. Maybe check the bathroom. It's worth a try. Now's my chance to sit in his stool and get the Mort experience. Oh... Oh...! You were right! It was behind the toilet! Oh, good...! Also, there was a rubber band, a marble and a toothbrush. Those are mine! (phone ringing) It's probably a telemarketer. Bob's Burgers. No, I don't have anything to refinance. I wish I did. Unfortunately, my only equity is in my car and, hello? Oh, they hung up. Super freaky, huh? What? Linda was right about who was calling and where Mort's wallet was. Two predictions in a row. Try a third one, Mom. Okay. The next person to walk in will be tall, dark and handsome. I... (clears throat) I'm already here. (Gene laughs) Good one, Papa. Thank you, son. You're welcome. I've heard of this before. Someone gets hit on their head or gets struck by lightning, and it unleashes psychic ability. Right. Right! Yeah! Everything was blurry for a second. That's probably when it was unleashed. Like a dog, when you take a leash off it. Uh... you guys are kind of reaching here. No. I've always believed in this sort of thing. Maybe this is happening to me because I'm open to it. Nothing is happening to you, Lin, because this sort of thing isn't real. It was just two small coincidences. That's what I call my testicles. Gene. Hmm? (doorbell jingles) Marshmallow in the house. Now, put a burger in my mouth. Oh, hey, Marshmallow. (gasps) Tall, dark and handsome. That settles it, Mom's psychic. No, she isn't. Marshmallow isn't handsome. She's... beautiful. Blush... Tomato, potato, Dad. Face it, Mom has powers. Promise me you'll use your powers for good, Mom. Promise me! I promise. I promise. Linda's psychic. What's your special power? I can crack anyone's back. Bob, come here. All right, just this once. (grunts) Whoa-ho-ho-ho! Right there. (cracking) There you go. Yeah. Ow...! (cracking) Ow...! That's it. That's it. I'll lay you down on the floor now. Bob: Marshmallow, get off me. That's not helping. Oh, my God! That's a knot. That's all it is. I can't breathe. If Mom really is psychic, we're gonna be on easy street. She can tell us the next big trend in teen fashion. I'll bet it's butt hats. Hats for your butt. No, guys. I mean, we can finally cash in. But we got to figure out if she's the real deal. Mom, what number am I thinking of? Not this again. Uh... four. No, nine. No-no-no, four. No. No. Nine. Is she right? I don't know. Now that's all I can think of. That was it. That was it. No. Tina, what number were you thinking of first? I think that was. Uh... four or nine. No...! I see it burning in my brain. That doesn't prove anything. So, how do you predict things, Mom? How do you do it?! I kind of close my eyes, and, uh, an image appears in my brain. That's called "having a thought," Lin. I don't expect you to understand, Bob. You'll never understand the psychic realm. You know, I feel sorry for you. Let's settle this once and for all. Dad, you give her a test. (snickers) Okay. If you're psychic, you should be able to tell me what I'm putting in this bowl. Close your eyes. (obnoxiously groans) You really don't have to make that sound. Yes, I do. (rhythmically grunts, groans) Give me your hands, Bobby. (grunts) Come on. No. Give me your hands, I got to feel them. Fine. If this... go ahead. (obnoxiously grunting) It's an orange. It's an orange. No... Amazing. Wow... No. No. No, whoa. No, amazing. It's an orange. Mom's a psychic! No, she's not! (singsongy): Yes, I am...! (grunting) (imitates grunting) No. No. No. I only make the sound. Don't make... you don't make the sound. Oh. I'm sorry. (grunting loudly) I'm getting an image! It's a "J." Do you have someone in your life whose name begins with a "J"? Yes! My accountant Geoffrey! Aha! Oh, but he spells it with a "G." Ah... Oh! He's Jewish! Aha! You nailed it! I'm meeting with him later today! That's right. Of course that's right. He just told you. Yeah. Sounds like someone's getting a tax refund. Whoa! (laughing) All right, good reading. I'm gonna file this year! Do me. Do me. I'm next. Out of the way. Okay. Okay. Mort, get out of the way. Okay, easy. Give me your hands, Teddy. Ew, they're sticky. (groaning) (imitates groaning) Mort, stop it! Mort, let her do the reading. (continues groaning) I see a color. I... see a color. It's your favorite color. Okay. And it's a primary color. That's incredible. It's, uh... I'm picking up shades, uh... red. Nope. Blue... No. Blue... No. Green... No. Uh... yellow. Yes. Yellow. Wow. Yeah! Yes, yes, yeah. Wow. On the 17th try. She got it, though. She got it. Okay. Oh, I'm getting something else. Yellow something, uh... Yellow what? (groaning) A ta... a taxi? No. Is it a house? No. Or a shirt? No... Is it a dress? Yeah. Yeah. It's a dress. I'm gonna meet a woman in a yellow dress. Yeah! Got it. What else? Uh... Th-Th-The change. What is it, Linda? Lo... loose change. "Loose change"? Yeah. You're gonna find a quarter. No, it's a nickel. And... maybe that will change my life? Yes. No. No. No. Teddy: Yep. I'm on a path now. Go meet a woman in a yellow dress and find a nickel. It's not a scavenger hunt, Teddy. It is to me. Bye, everyone. Oh, I got to rest. Guys, I figured out how we can use Mom's psychic brain to get us on the gravy train. So, what's the plan? It involves horses and money and us getting some. Some horses? Some money... Oh. (doorbell jingles) (Linda groaning) (continues groaning) Hey, kids, how was school? Boring. Meh. Fun. I mean, whatever. (Linda groans, laughs) What's going on here? Oh. Your mother has gone nuts. (rhythmically groans) I see something, uh... it's bell-shaped. It's, uh... Yeah? Maybe it's a bell? Is it the Liberty Bell? That's what it is. It's the Liberty Bell. It's the Liberty Bell. My ex-boyfriend lives in Philadelphia. Should I go there? Should I get a cheesesteak? Gretchen! Go to him. I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna do it! Go to him. Wait till Philly sees my crack. (laughs) Hi, Bob. Hi. Bye... Stay away from trains! I'm gonna get a train ticket. Gretchen, come back! No. No. Well, maybe trains are fine. Well, that seemed to work out, Lin. Yeah. That was another good one. Another one down. Yeah. You just sent a woman, a grown woman to another state, 'cause you claim you're psychic. Yeah. Right. Great. I believe in you, Mother. Thank you, Louise. You have a gift. It's gonna make some people nervous. If this was 1980, you'd be burned as a witch. Exactly. On a happier note, which name do you like more: Sea Bagel, Pride of Detroit, Mudbutt or Gelding the Lily? (groaning) Lily. Go with the Lily one. What is this for? Oh. We're renaming Tina. Oh! I'm glad I didn't choose Mudbutt. Okay, guys. Mom picked a horse in tomorrow's race. Now all we need is money to place a bet. You guys have money? If you're asking me to sell my hair, the answer is no! Tina, what's left of your savings? $82.40. But, with interest, it could be more than that. I haven't checked for a while. I want to be surprised when I look. Great! We'll put $82 on Gelding the Lily, collect our winnings and split it three ways. Three ways? But I'm putting up all the money. But it was my idea, and Gene's your brother. Probably. And we'll spend the day looking at horses! Let's do it. Order up, Lin. Can you take this over? Shh. Not now, Bobby. I'm getting something. Hold on. Oh, my God. This is weird. I'm feeling something. No, you're not. Reporter: Dizzy Dog, the beloved statue who's welcomed visitors to Wonder Wharf for over 30 years, has been dognapped from his familiar place at the end of the pier, leaving police baffled. If you have any information on the whereabouts of Dizzy Dog, (groaning) please call in to our tip line. Dizzy... Doggy. Hello? Tip line? Seriously, Lin? (groaning) Hi. Hello, tip line? Hold on, hold on. (groaning) I have a tip. Are they confused why Jerry Lewis is calling? I... You know, I see water. Uh, Lin, stop. Hang up the phone. he's surrounded by water, and I also see Do not do this. a foamy substance. This is ridiculous. Stop. Bob, I'm on the phone. And he's crying out. Dizzy Dog's crying out, "Help me. Lin, Help me. Help me." hang up. Bob: It was one thing when you were just playing with Mort and Teddy and Gretchen, but when you call in a tip to the news, it's kind of taking things to another level, Lin. Why is it so hard for you to believe, Bob? Because it's not possible, Lin. That's what Coach Blevins said about me doing a sit-up, and now look. (grunting) Yeah, Dad. Why can't you just be supportive? Get Mom's back? Yeah. Aw, forget it. Tina, I'm not supporting this because it's irresponsible. And not real. Oh, yeah? Well, I predict you fall down a flight of stairs. Is that a threat? No. It's a warning. Be very careful, that's all. Okay. Sounds good. Tripity tripity, dibidy do. What? Look. Reporter: Wonder Wharf's own Dizzy Dog is home safe after apparently being knocked off the pier into the ocean. Gene: Yay! Dizzy Dog is safe! The discovery was made thanks to a tip from Linda Belcher, local psychic. What?! Wow. Ha! They found him in the water! All right, Mom! We always believed you, Mom. Remember that?  I got power.    you pass that rag, Linda Belcher, local psychic? I predict, yes. Oh, my God. Dad, why can't you just let Mom have this? Like I let Gene be the family jokester. I could be that. So, Lin, I was just curious, when am I gonna fall down that set of stairs? I haven't fallen down a set of stairs yet. You're stealing her thunder again! (chuckles) So now you believe. No... But if I did, when would it happen? At fall-thirty. What? See? What? Sorry, Gene, you can say it. At fall-thirty. It's funnier when Gene says it. Yeah. (sighs) Hello, Linda Belcher. Hey! Sergeant Bosco! Apparently, you're some kind of psychic? Yeah. Well, some people think so. Oh, my God. Well, you really came through with that Dizzy Dog thing anyway. I did. Bob: Oh, my God. I need your help with another case. A real case. This is the big time. Hit me with it. You're going to help me catch... the Little Boy Bandit. (gasps) The Little Boy Bandit from the news. You've got to be kidding. Mom is a police psychic! Narc! I gotta go lay down. So you want me to help you catch the Little Boy Bandit? That's a big case. It's huge. And I don't want your help, I need it. I'm desperate on this one. The Little Boy Bandit has robbed eight businesses in the past month. That makes me look bad. I'm not sure about using my powers to catch a little boy. Like a fairy tale witch. No, we think he's a very small man wearing kid's clothes, a wig stapled to his baseball cap, and those roller shoes to get away. Blend into the crowd, you know? Sounds like Sandy Duncan. Everybody sounds like Sandy Duncan to you, Mom! Sandy Duncan this, Sandy Duncan that. Oh! Look, I'm under a lot of pressure to catch this guy, and I got nothing! So you're open to the idea of psychic abilities? In any other situation I'd say no and laugh in your crazy face. But I'm out of leads. You're my last hope. You're doomed. I'll help however I can, Sergeant. Great. Let's roll. Bye, kids! Keep your father away from the stairs! Have Dad run up and down the stairs. Got it! Your job is on the line and you brought in a psychic? Yeah. She called the Dizzy Dog thing. If this doesn't work out, the captain's gonna put you back on patrol. I'd miss you! Don't worry about it. So, here are all the places the Little Boy Bandit has hit. Mm... There seems to be no pattern, but maybe you'll get a feeling or something. Huh, he seems to go after the stores that have little flags on 'em. (chokes) Never mind. Let's just go touch stuff in the evidence room. All of these items were handled by the Little Boy Bandit during his various robberies. So grab something and see if you get a reading or whatever. Wow! What was this used for? Put that down! Hah. It's for a different case. Wha-ga-ning. Okay, but you got the wrong guy. Really? I think. Just kidding. We know we got the wrong guy. Oh. (laughs) Try this. All right, let's see. (grunting) Uh! Nothing's coming to me. Come on. Just do whatever you did for the knife! Ticktock! I'm still figuring out how this works! I don't know when it comes and goes. I hit my head the first time. Maybe I need to get hit again? Okay. No, no, no, maybe I'm just hungry or something. Fine. Let's go get lunch. Ooh, do we get free hot dogs from the carts? I do, you don't. Hi, kids. All: Hi, Teddy. Teddy, guys! This quest your mom sent me on is exhausting. I haven't found a nickel or any women in yellow dresses. But I did find this penny in a urinal! Ew. Ah, no! My pee penny! (sighs) So why'd you guys want to meet me here? Our mom sent us on a quest, too. We're supposed to bet on a horse. Wow! That's much better than finding a nickel. And we need our favorite Teddy to place the bet for us. Hey, maybe you'll see a lady in a yellow dress at the track, hmm? Or a horse in a yellow dress. At this point, I'd take either! So let's go gamble, huh, kids? Uh, need some more buns. Linda: Tripity tripity, dibidy do. Huh. Why don't we have a railing? Huh. Okay. Easy does it. Looking good. Halfway down. All right, Linda, that's your fourth dog. Anything coming to you yet? Nah. Uh, not yet. Oh, wait, something's coming, something's coming. (burps) Oh. It's just a burp. I'm gassy. Come on, Linda, focus. Sorry. Look, if I don't catch this guy, my captain'll tear me a new one. Now take a look in that brain of yours and tell me where he's gonna strike next. All right, give me a minute. Psychics didn't predict Rome in a day, hold on. Ooh... Oh, I see a building. Good, keep going. I see walls. Yeah. Oh, and, uh, windows. All right. You can see right out 'em. Yeah, I get it. There's, uh, oh, there's something on the wall. Maybe pictures. What are you talking about? Art? Building with art? (burps) I'm still gassy, uh... What about the Wharf Art Center? Is it the Wharf Art Center? War Farts? Wharf Arts. They have a charity ball thing going on there right now, today. Lots of wallets and purses and jewelry. Let's roll. Let's go down there. I'm still eating my hot dog. They have food at the thing. Tell Mom and Dad that I'll miss them, but I'm home now. Oh, crap. Need tomatoes. (sighs) Here we go. Wait a second. I know how to do this. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. (chuckles) (cackles) (classical music playing) You still feel good about this, Linda? I hope you do. Yeah, it's beautiful. Not that crap, your vision. Stop eating. My whole career is on the line. I have a lot of cops undercover here. I keep telling him to quit the force and just play.  La, la, la, la, la.  All right, get out of here, you're gonna blow our cover. Okay, okay. (whispers):  La, la, la, la.  Shush. Stop it.  I'm back. Bob: Oh, good. Nothing you told anyone was remotely accurate, and now everyone is mad at you. What? It's true, Linda. I went to Philadelphia last night and I find out my ex-boyfriend is married and he's faithful. Thanks a lot. Well... Yeah, and my meeting with my accountant was because I'm being audited. Linda: Aw. I dry cleaned my Speedo like you said, and now it looks ridiculous. Yeah, and not only did I not win the shrimp-eating contest, there was no shrimp-eating contest. And I owe the Shrimp Hut $200. Aw. Yeah. And I have yet to fall down any stairs. In fact, I've gone up and down many sets of stairs. Just for fun, once. So you're not psychic. But I don't get it. I got all those other predictions right. Or did I kind of just use common sense? I guess I saw Mort's wallet falling out. And telemarketers call around 3:00 every day. And I guess your hand smelled like oranges. Oh, God. I Kaiser-Soze'd myself. So you're saying you are not... I'm not psychic. Wow, who could have seen that coming? Just me, I guess. Oh, I'm sorry, everyone. I'm sorry. Don't throw... Stop throwing things. I guess I got carried away. I let you all down. You sure did. Well, at least no one got hurt. Uh-oh. What? Bosco's in deep. Because of me, he staked his whole career on the Little Boy Bandit robbing the charity ball. (phone rings) Bob's Burgers. Bobby, it's me. I'm at the track. Is Linda sure the dress is yellow? Well... Could it be a floral pattern? And not a dress but a vest? Teddy. Teddy. I think we're supposed to meet, but I'm not feeling any chemistry, to be perfectly honest. Teddy. Teddy. Nothing. Like, zero. Teddy. W-What's up, Bob? Listen, shockingly, it turns out Linda's not psychic. Oh. Yeah. Oh. That's actually a relief. I was terrible at her predictions. But, boy, the kids are gonna be crushed. Why? They put all their money on that horse Linda picked. Wait, where are the kids? They're with me at the track. What? You didn't know, Bobby? No. You really should keep a better eye on your kids, Bobby. You know, they could end up anywhere. In this case, they're safely with me at the track. Nothing to worry about. Tina, don't touch that. Louise, get off of the track, the horses are racing. I'd better go. Bye, Bob. Teddy? Teddy? Okay, you go tell Bosco you're not psychic. I have to go pick up the kids from the track, where you sent them. Aw, nuts. (whispers): Bosco. Bosco. What? What are you doing here? I got bad news. I guess, uh... I guess I'm not a psychic after all. A real psychic. Amateur. What? Well, uh, yeah, uh, sorry. Listen, I've put everything on the line here, because you said you were psychic. So you better get psychic and fast. I'm arresting somebody tonight. Who you gonna arrest? You. Me? Yes. For what? Eating too many hot dogs? Impersonating a psychic. Oh. Ooh. Hey, look. That's Gelding the Lily. Our race is next. I want to get his autograph. Kids. There you are. And Teddy. Teddy's here, too, Bobby. Hi, Teddy. Come on, everyone, let's go. No, no, no, no, no. But our race is next. We already placed our bet. And Tina is getting an autograph from a horse. He's not great at holding a pen. Then can you sign it as him? Ugh, fine. You just have to put the pen in your mouth. Uh, I kind of don't have all day. Here, like this. Just like you're a horse. Like how a horse would s... would sign an autograph. See? Oh, you dropped your wig. Uh, thanks. What's that for? I am a... birthday clown. I got a thing after the race. Oops. You dropped your roller shoe. What's this for? It is... for my clowning. I'm a roller skate clown jockey guy. Wow, triple threat. Oh, my God. He's the Little Boy Bandit. What did you say? Me? Nothing. Uh, have a great race. Oh, thanks. W-What? I said thanks. Did you say thanks? Oh, sorry, you go. Thank you. No problem. (phone rings) I predict this is my husband. (chuckles) Just kidding, I knew it was. Caller ID, sorry. Hello? (whispers): Linda. He's here. The Little Boy Bandit is at the track. He's a jockey. What? His race is about to begin. Tell Bosco. Get him here as soon as you can. Bosco. Good news. (whispers): Bobby just called and said... (trumpeting, bell dinging) Let's go, Gelding the Lily. He'd run so much faster without metal shoes. Announcer (over P.A.): And they're in the home stretch. Gelding the Lily is pulling away. Come on. Come on! He's actually gonna win. (sirens wail) Go! (sirens wind down) (neighs) No, no, no, no, no, no! We would have won. (grunts) I think I'm gonna have my next birthday party here at the track. Reporter: So the Little Boy Bandit will be riding off into the sunset, to jail. I'm here with arresting officer Sergeant Bosco. Let this be a warning: if you commit a crime and you're under five feet tall, Bosco will catch you. I did have some help, though, from a friend. (gasps) My g*n. And his friend, my other g*n. Oh. Bosco: When's this gonna air? Reporter: We're live. Well, I'm just happy that we can all agree now there is definitely no such thing as psychic powers. Oh, I still believe, Bob. What? Yeah. I may not have psychic powers myself, but I know they exist. After everything that's happened, Lin. Yes, Bob. I have faith in the unknown and you don't. If I had to do it all over again, I would. Who knows? You got to stay open to this stuff. (speaks in tongues) Lin, you almost cost a man his job. But in a way, Mom helped Bosco catch the Little Boy Bandit. No, she didn't. We saw him and then called her. But if Mom hadn't thought she was psychic, we never would have gone to the track in the first place. Yeah, Dad. See, Bob? (scoffs) You're all nuts. There is no such thi... (thumping) Ow. Oh. Bob? Bob: Yup? You all right? Bob: Yeah. Did you just fall? Bob: No. I did not fall. Okay. Bob: I walked down the stairs. Walked down the stairs really fast. I thought I just heard a fall. Bob: G-Gene. Yeah? Bob: Will you come down here for a sec? Sure, I'd love to. She is psychic. She is a witch. Burn her! (Linda speaking in tongues) Nothing's coming to me. (speaks in tongues) ©2014 20TH CENTURY FOX TELEVISION
Good morning, Chariot. Good morning, Peggy-Sis. Do you want to run into town? No. It's too hot to trot. (all laughing) (all yell) All: Xandar! (laughing evilly) Equestranauts, I've cast a spell on Horse Valley Farm that will bring a thousand years of darkness. (laughing) Oh, no. We have to stop him. To the stable. (fast-tempo rock and roll music plays) Announcer: Peggy-Sis. Headhorn. Chariot. And Minnie. Together they are: Equestranauts: The Equestranauts! Do I like this show? Neigh... I do not. I told you we should have watched reruns of Melrose Place. So, Chariot, are you as excited about going to the Equestranaut convention today as I am? (as Chariot): Maybe even more excited. (normal): Well, it's not a contest, Chariot. You ready to go, honey? I was born ready. Let's giddyap, people. Wait, you guys are going, too? Uh, we're not not going to a toy-pony convention. And Chariot's gonna get a new saddle. Finally. Chariot? That's kind of a weird name for a horse, isn't it? Why is that? It's like, "Hey, who's pulling the chariot? It's Chariot." Oh, my God. Why am I analyzing this show? Anyway, you guys can't all go. Who's gonna help me with the restaurant? Not me. I traded shifts with Antonio. Never mind. Never mind. Just go. All: Yay! Guess I'll be here with Antonio, the employee Gene made up. You should know, he thinks you k*lled his father, so he may... seek revenge. Good luck. Hey, Bob. You going to EquestraCon? Uh, no, Teddy. Because that's a convention for little girls that like toy horses. Uh, beg to differ, Bob. It's for guys that like toy horses. They're called Equesticles. "Equesticles"? Yeah. 'Cause they got testicles. 'Cause they're men. Tina: I'm really here. I'm really here. I'm... Where am I? This isn't a community of my peers. Does anyone else think these girls all look like men? I think they are men. This is a kind of man. We discovered a new kind of man. Do you think they're dangerous? (humming a tune) Mmm... no. (sighs): Oh, God. Poor Tina. I know, right? Why do men have to ruin everything? (scoffs) I don't know. But we kind of do. What's with us? Aah...! All the war. All of the war. And this, too. It is a good show, though. It is? Yeah. It's pretty good. Well, some episodes before the reboot. So, I guess we should jump on in there. Oh, no. I said I wanted to "see" it, not, like, walk around in it. On my legs. Yeah, Tina. What do we look like to you? People that walk on their legs? Well, I'm gonna go check out the food court. Oh, yeah. Let's watch them eat. And watch me eat. You guys should see what I can do with nachos these days. Louise: What? Gene: You'll see... Okay. I guess I'll just take a lap. Meet you back here in 12 hours? Ooh. I like this one. That's hand-stitched. They're $95. $95? You could buy an actual saddle for that. (Tina nervously laughs) Okay. Never mind. I guess I can't get you a new saddle, girl. Don't look at me like that. Nice Chariot doll. Is it your dad's? (sighs) No. It's mine. Wha... What's, what's the matter, little lady? I guess I just feel a little out of place here. Maybe because I don't have enough money. And I'm not a grown man. Oh. You can barely tell. Listen, why don't you hang out with us? This is Sunpuddle. Ta-da. Horseplay. Pleasure. Pony Danza. Neigh! And I'm Bronconius. Great. I'm Tina. I was starting to feel like I didn't belong. Are you kidding? Everyone belongs here. That's what the Equestranauts is all about. You can be anything you want to be. No judgments. Well, some judgment by me, like this. Hot mess. Hey. Are you okay? You're a cute mess. I want to talk more about that pony, Tina. When'd you get it? I came out of the womb with it. Just kidding. I got it on my fifth birthday. (laughing) I didn't recognize it as a joke at first. Well, my theory is the original series and the reboot take place in the same multiverse. Yes! That totally makes sense. Then how do you explain the lncepticon? Come on. Were they lncepti-kidding? (all laughing hysterically) I guess they were. Say, Tina, have you ever thought about, uh... selling that pony? Oh, no. Why, Bronconius? Oh. Just Bron-curious. So... you're the original owner? Yeah, but I hate to say I'm her owner. I prefer mother, caretaker, best friend and role model. And she couldn't ask for a better role model. Look at all you've accomplished Tina, with your... bangs... and your... socks. Thank you. Oh. Hey. Oh, my gosh. What's this? Why, it's the new Cosmic Twinkle Chariot doll. Gee, and I don't even really need it. Want to just trade straight up? (sighs): Yeah... I-I don't know. Tina. Tina. Tina. Face it, your Chariot doll's looking a little... giddy-yuck. Me and the guys here think you deserve an upgrade. Right, guys? Right, guys? Ye... yeah. Right. Yeah, I think that. Sure. Treat yourself. See? This is (grunts) gross. But this... Oh... so pretty. It is pretty. Everyone will envy you. Um... okay. Bronconius: Great! Well, got to gallop. What? Oh. Bronconius: Guys, let's pick it up. All: Bye. B-Bye. (laughs) The rarest Chariot doll is mine! And all I had to do was swindle little miss Tina-bopper. She had no idea what it was worth! What the...? (Bronconius laughs evilly) Uh, great, Bronconius. Good job. Tina, did some guy just swindle you out of your toy horse? What? No. I mean, kind of. Why did you say that? He just said it. Wha? Who? Wha... What's going on? Wha? Tina got swindled! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Ah...! I told you, we should never have left the food court! How could I be so stupid? Bronconius played me for a fool. I can't believe someone cheated you out of your doll. Equesticles! (growls) Can't trust them. Why would somebody do that? What's so special about your horse? "The rarest Equestranaut." Only six in the world! My Chariot was rare? She never even mentioned it. She was so humble. It has a rare production defect. It has camel toe. It has camel toes? No. Camel toe. Oh... Well, this is ridiculous. She's just a kid. And I bought that the night before your fifth birthday when your mom remembered we didn't have anything else for you. I'm going down to that convention and I'm getting that doll back. Bronconius isn't gonna just give it back, Dad. Wake up! He tricked Tina! We got to fight trick with trick! Like what, Louise? Dad's gonna waltz in there disguised as an Equesticle with a complete knowledge of the show, earn their trust, infiltrate their inner sanctum, then steal Chariot back? Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! And yes! No, no and no. Oh, come on! We've always wanted to give you a makeover. And I've always wanted to make you a silly costume that you have to wear in public. And you love me and would do anything for me. Yeah, do it for us. (groans) Okay. Fine. All: Yay! Undercover Horse Dad! PEGGY-SIS: I love a good picnic after completing a mission. And I love a good picnic after completing a picnic. Ponies: Minnie! (Minnie laughs) So, Minnie's power is, she's small? Yes, Dad! And it comes in extremely handy in many of their missions. Focus, damn it. I'm sorry, Tina. I'm trying. Dad, you have to be perfect. These people know everything there is to know about the Equestranaut multiverse. One slipup, and it's over. Okay. So, I'll just watch this a few more times, take notes and... And all these. Okay. And read all of this. Uh, that's a lot. And when you brush your teeth tonight, use this Chariot toothbrush. Seriously? We can't take any chances. Fine. I'll use it. So, the mane is the bristles. Right. Right. I got that. Well, you're doing it backwards. Oh. Oh. Right. It has two manes. Oh. That's the tail. No. That's... Yes. I got it. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Louise: Wow! Amazing. I, uh... I have no words. Dad, pop quiz: Who did Horsana marry in season three? (groans) Prince Horson. No. It was King Horsely. Correct. And what's the capital of Horse Valley? Well, a lot of people would say Horseterdam, because that's the largest municipality, but it's actually Salt Lick City. That's right. Ha! I would have said Horse-pelier. And finally, who would win in a fight between all four Equestranauts? Oh, my God. Um... trick question. Because the Equestranauts have a bond of friendship greater than any force in the universe, so they would never have a fight. You're ready. Bobby, this whole thing is turning me on. You're like a sexy spy. Yeah. I kind of am. Whoa. Except I'm wearing a horse costume. Yeah. Remember, you're Bucephala. She's their favorite minor character, so you'll have something to talk about. Your pony name is Bob-cephala. (scoffs) Why do I even need a name? Do you have a pony name? No! I'm a girl. Girls who watch the show are just girls. But you're a man. So act like a man and use your pony name. Wait! I think I see them! Where? Where? Right behind you. Abort! Abort! Take your cyanide capsule. Gene, get off the phone. Hey, nice Bucephala. Thanks. She's, uh, my favorite minor character. Well, have a great 'con! I was just gonna walk in this direction as well. So, yeah, I-I... oh, man, I love the Equestranauts. Uh-huh. Yeah. Very much. All the different ponies... interacting. (phone ringing)   (nervously laughs) It's my phone. One moment. (whispering): What is it? Dad, you're tense. I can tell from here you're tense. Just relax. Do it! Do it! Relax. Do it! And, Dad, you walk funny. (whispering): Not helping, Gene. I'm just saying, work on that. Okay. (sighs) Anyway, have you guys ever heard of this rare Chariot doll that... Look! There's Bronconius. (phone ringing) What now? Dad, that's him. That's the guy that took my pony. Do not let him see you walk. Hi, Bronconius. Have you been having a super great time today? Up-bup-bup-bup-bup. Who's this fella? This... Bucephela. Uh, it's actually Bob-cephela, but you can call me Bob. It's a shortened form of the name. Nice costume. Oh. Thank you. No. I was being sarcastic. It's ridiculous. Uh... what's wrong with it? Actually, it's like 50% the costume and 50% the way your body looks in it. Well, season five, episode 12 called, and it wants your costume back... after you wash it. (others gasping) Got a little bite in you, huh? Little kicky? Um... I like it. Oh. Question: What's wrong with our faces? Others: They're not painted. Face painting booth! Bob-cephela? Yeah! Def... uh, yeah. Count-count me in... to that. Look at Bob. He's so happy. What a playdate. He's so deep undercover, he's forgotten who he is. Oh, my God! What if he becomes a double agent and starts spying on us for them? What a day. Phew! After all that fun, it would be great just to sit down and chat about, like, what rare collectibles we've gotten recently, right? You go first. Well, I'd love to, but I got to go primp for the party. You going to the party? The party? Uh, yeah... uh, yeah, sure. You primp? You groom? Yeah, I-I primp and groom. Good. So we'll all go primp and groom and meet back up at the party. So we'll talk... at the party? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Got to go, got to primp! See you there, Bob-cephela! Tina, clear some space on your bookshelf. Chariot is coming home. I don't keep Chariot on my bookshelf. It's a saying, Tina! I could clear some space on my dresser. Forget it. Okay, bookshelf. (dance music plays, cheering and whooping) Hey, guys! All: Bob-cephala! Drink? Sure. We were just talking about which Equestranaut has the best power. Oh, I'm not getting in the middle of this one. Oh, come on, Bob, you have to answer. Well, it's definitely not Headhorn. What?! What?! Hold on! I was just kidding, Horseplay. Relax. Oh, I'm sorry. I really like Headhorn. Wow. Ugh! What is in this? It's a cocktail, designed by and for Equestranaut lovers. It's called Horse Medicine. This will really help you get into character, Bob. (laughter) Great. Bob-cephela! Did you... primp? Yeah. I mean, I thought I did. But you didn't groom. I did, Bronconius! Please. Sunpuddle. Shh. Can I refill your trough? I-I, um, I have one. Thanks, I'll... Two, please, maestro. I'll have another. I'm impressed with all the studying Dad did. He has a real mind for Equestranauts trivia. The most useful skill in the world. I know, right? (gasps) How did this get in here? It's non-canonical! It's what? Are you trying to say nautical? Non-canonical! Non-canonical! She's gone crazy! Let's put her down! Dad, call me as soon as you get this! You're in trouble! Non-canonical! Non-canonical! So, great party. I mean, really... good dancing. Oh, God. Except for that guy. You're such an Equestrabully. It's refreshing. Sometimes it gets a little too happy in Horse Valley, you know? Sure. I feel that way, as well, all the time. Hey, uh, can I ask you something? I know you're the expert around here on Equestranaut stuff. Oh, well, it's just something I've proven time and time again. Well, I heard a rumor that there's this really rare Chariot doll with, like, major camel toe. Do you know if that's true? Oh, it's true. Course, I'd never seen one myself until... Pony Danza: Bronconius! Come dance with us! Mmm, Bob, come, let's show them how it's done! (whinnies) (others whinnying) Mom, Dad's in danger! Oh, what are you talking about? He's surrounded by men who play with toy ponies. He's in the least amount of danger possible. No! When I gave him all the stuff to study, I accidentally put in some of my Equestranaut fan fiction! That means he thinks certain zombie-horse-related things happened that didn't. And if he says the wrong thing, they'll know he's not an Equesticle! We have to go find him! Tina, I love you, but please don't make me go back there. It smells bad. We have to go! (dance music playing) Bob: Oh, man, this is powerful stuff. Whew! This is great! Almost as great as when the Equestranauts had a dance party and met that girl from Earth with dark hair and glasses that had three boyfriends. What? Nothing. Uh, I feel good! Where are we going? (whooping and cheering) (laughter) Gentlemen, the after-party. (man singing) Bob: This looks scary. I mean, fun. I like it. Sunpuddle, no, no, no, no. That's Bob's seat. Are you named Bob? Oh. I was just... Bob, come. Sorry, Sunpuddle. Oh, he's always doing that to me. All these... Equesticles. We both know they're weak, pathetic. I-I don't think that. Yes, you do. I do sometimes, yeah. We're tougher than them. We don't fear d*ath. What? That's why we're best friends, Bob. We're best friends? Are you asking? Because I accept. And I'm going to let you in on a little mind-blowing Equestra-miracle I've discovered. You were inquiring about the camel-toed Chariot? Yes, uh, yeah, yeah. Follow me. (quiet laughing) (dance music playing) Ugh! Where's Dad? He could blow his cover any second! We got to find that Bronconius guy! But how?! Who wants a ride to Bronconius's party? Oh. Good. Mom? Mom? We're following him. But I want to dance. (grunting) Go, girl! Mom! Ooh, ah. Fine. You kids never take me dancing! I want to show you something extraordinary. (gasps) Oh, my God, this is it. What? Uh, nothing. Just that, um, that's a great-looking safe. Oh. Uh, thanks? It's the hotel's, but, Bob, feast your eyes upon... the rarest Equestranauts ever produced. The Scottie Pippen Special Edition Headhorn. Estonian Version Peggy-Sis, Peggy-Stroika. This thing brought down the wall. A gold-plated Minnie previously owned by Jon Hamm. And my greatest treasure of them all... the ultra-rare camel-toe Chariot. Yes! Yes! Oh, God, that's a great collection you have there. Uh, can I take a look at the Chariot one? Oh, this is more than just a mere collection, Bob. You see, the Equestranauts are eternally young. They have a power. And the rare ones... more power still. But I can harness that power and take youth from them. Do you know how old I am, Bob? I'm 49, but I look... 39? 20. Or 20. Yes. Yeah, or younger. Bob, my best buddy, you could join me. We could live forever. All you have to do is merge mouths like this. (moaning) Oh. Oh, God. Oh, I'm getting younger. I can feel it. Can you tell, Bob? Uh, yup, mm-hmm, yup. Look around the side of the eyes. You see it? Yeah, yeah, uh, looking... good. Do you still recognize me? (moaning) Do you? Immortality! Equestranauts never die. Uh, you know, except for Zombie Horse. I beg your pardon? Zombie Horse, the fifth Equestranaut. He died, and then became a zombie. Zombie... Horse. Why am I telling you? You've seen every episode. Indeed, I have seen every episode. Anyhoo, uh, let me plant my lips on that Chariot, uh... Why don't we get back to the party? But I-I, you know, I want to... I really want to kiss the doll. Later. So, you're a real Equesticle, aren't you, Bob? Yeah, of course. W-Why wouldn't I be? Well, then, Bob, you'll have no problem getting the official unofficial Equesticle "tuh-too." Uh, I... no. No. I... Not-not a problem to get a tattoo. Maybe not, but maybe... I would... think... I would think about it. Remove your shirt. Oh, boy. Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Oh, no! What are they doing to my Bobby? I think he was getting a back massage with a needle and men holding him down. A tattoo! They're tramp-stamping our tramp! How's my best buddy doing? Um, very excited, but I'd sure love to check out those dolls again real quick, and, um, I think I have to pee. Should I pee now...? Right after this. Um... guys, maybe just a little tattoo? How about just a little one? Oh, uh-huh. Mmm. Like, really little, like, tiny? Little tiny little one? Yeah, that'd be great. Mm-hmm. Sure, Bob. Sure. Do this that size. (others gasping) Bronconius, I-I don't think we should... Quiet! Okay, sounds good. Of course, Bob, if you've never had a tuh-too before, sometimes a really small tuh-too feels like you're getting a big giant tuh-too, but that's just an illusion of the senses. Oh, God, I wish you would call it "tattoo." What am I saying? "Tuh-too." It's fine. Let's just get this over with. (neighing outside door, knocking) Tina: Let me in! It's Tina! The girl whose pony Bronconius stole! Don't tattoo my dad! Counterpoint... do tattoo him! Make it say "I love Linda." Or give him some more nipples! You can never have enough! Ask a cat. I knew it! You never were a real Equesticle, and you lied to me. My best friend! Oh, please! It would go Sunpuddle, then Horseplay, then Pony Danza before you. Oh, Bob, we could have had everything. We could have had the whole world to ourselves. And you threw it all away, and for what? Your daughter?! Um... yes. You're crazy. Tuh-too him! (yelling) Stop! Oh, the door was unlocked. Yeah, it's so we don't have to get up every time someone else arrives. You, be gone! I'm done with you. But I'm not done. Look at what you've all become. You've betrayed the meaning of the Equestranauts. And I don't mean the sexually-charged, awkward, confusing vibe at this party. I like sexually-charged, awkward, confusing things, too. Like, for instance... Tina. Sorry. But being an Equesticle means no judgment, right, Horseplay? I mean, you accepted me, and I don't even have testicles. Bronconius hijacked this thing you all love and tainted it. He's the real Xandar. I know who that is. He's the bad guy. Hush! Get her out of here! Like, now! The Eqranauts would never turn against a fellow pony. The Equestranauts have a bond of friendship greater than any force in the universe, and you know that! She's right. (groaning) Here, get up. What?! I'll tuh-too him myself! Mm-mm! Mm-mm! You were never nice to us! You never even took the time to get to know us, and we're all really terrific! (grunting) Oh, phew. Put a shirt on! Wait! Dad did get a tattoo! I did? What-what does it look like? Is it... is it cool? Louise: It's... not cool. No, it's cool... sort of. Someday you will all die, and I will still have the body of a 20-year-old! All right, great, let's open that safe. Ha! You'll never get into that safe! The combination is based on an Equestranauts reference so obscure that only the smartest, most knowledgeable Equesticle in the world could figure it out! That Equesticle is me. Front desk? There you go. Oh, well, that was actually easy. Thank you. Chariot, I missed you. So, good party? So fun. Okay, well, bye, everyone. Sunpuddle, I'll call you. You better. Hey Tina, you must be enjoying having Chariot ba... Hey. What's going on? I'm packing up Chariot. What? Why? Oh, I'm just getting a little old to play with dolls, you know? But thanks for getting her back. Hurray. Tina... What? Play with the doll. But I'm too old to... Tina, play with the doll! Play with the doll, Tina! Come on, do what Daddy says. Mmm... Play with it! Okay! I'll... Neigh! Make it jump! Uh, well, the... she doesn't actually jump. I know it doesn't jump! You know how I know that? 'Cause... 'Cause I read 1,200 pages of Equestranaut crap! Mmm... Keep playing with it! Okay. (weakly neighs) Good night. Good night. © 2014 20TH CENTURY FOX TELEVISION
Low tide is great. The ocean is just giving this stuff away? If you see any bottles, check for a romantic message inside. I call dibs on any hook hands or peg legs. Hey, what do you think this is? (sniffs) It smells disgusting! (sniffs) No, wait, it smells amazing! (sniffs) Like the boys' locker room on a hot summer day. All: (sniffing) Gross! (sniffing) Great! (sniffing) Gross! Great! I can't stop smelling this enigma of gross-great. Is that what s*x will be like? Hey, Mr. Fisch! Hey, m'lady Bob. (chuckles) Uh, rent's not due, is it? I mean more due than usual? Relax. I just stopped by to introduce you to my brother. Brother? I didn't know you had a brother. Yep, I have a brother. Felix. He's, uh, in town for a while. (quietly): His inheritance ran out. So he'll be doing some of the landlording around here. Keep him out of my hair, will you? Um, o-okay. Where is he? He's right, uh... Oh. Uh, oh, he might not want to come in. Felix, come here! Felix: No! Felix... It looks gross! Please, Felix. It's okay to come in. I came in, and look at me. I'm fine! (door opens) There you go. Hi, pal. Hi! Greetings! (quietly): I don't want to be here. Shush. For all your landlording needs, (grunts) Felix is your man. Oh, uh, great. Well, did you get my messages about the bathroom? That I left you? For the last several months? Yes, I got them. How the hell did you get my number? You gave it to me when we met. Not to use! Well, uh, last week, the sink exploded. And the hot water is brown. Hot brown water? Felix loves hot brown water. I do? He's good at all that stuff that you just were yammering on about. Well, gotta go. Okay, so do you want to call a... Yes, I'll call whatever you were about to say. Plumber. Plumber. Of course, yes. Why? You know, I can just call him. I'm supposed to call him! Okay. Oh, my God. Is it always like this? Does it always take this long? Is there always this much talking? What? Don't say anything else! I'm not getting roped into another hour-long discussion! I'll call your plumber! Good-bye! (huffing) Rich people run funny. Must be all the money in their pockets. Or it's their big, rich, golden wieners. Eh, it's probably their wieners. Yep. Guys, you know that lump we found on the beach? My name's Gene! No, the smelly lump. His name's Gene! The other lump. It's called... ambergris. Ambergris, aka beach garbage. And it comes from sperm whales: "When a whale "eats a squid, the sharp squid beak may irritate the whale's digestive system." Hey, whale, maybe stop eating sharp squid beak! What are you trying to do?! "When that happens, the whale's stomach coats the squid beak in a waxy substance that the whale then passes." Gene: Passes to who? Like in sports? Boring whale sports. I think "passes" means "poops out." Go on. "Fun fact: Ambergris is used in the production of high-end perfumes." People pay to wear whale poop? Wake up, Louise! People wear all sorts of animal poops we don't even know about! It's not poop at all. It's a waxy substance that whales secrete from... Whoa! You can eat it! "King Charles II's favorite meal was ambergris and eggs." Yep, he looks like a breakfast-for-dinner kinda guy. That piece sold for $30,000? Our piece is bigger than that piece. Ah! Jackpot! Wait, whoa, whoa, where is our piece? Where is it? Gene put it in Mom and Dad's bed. (panting) Hey, why are you going into our bedroom? Probably putting something gross in our bed. I'm taking something gross out of your bed! Oh, good. Thanks, sweetie! Okay. Here it is. I'm holding $30,000 in my hands. If somebody wants this and has that much money, they will give it to us? Am I saying that right? That can't possibly be right. Slice me off a little nugget of that, will ya? I just want to rest it on my tongue. No way, Gene. Hey, but with your share of the money, you can buy some other ambergris and eat that. Yes! It's like instant gratification but later! Uhhhh... What, Tina? We can't sell it. What are you talking about? It says here: Ambergris is illegal to sell because whales are endangered. Oh, well. I'll just, um, look up the number for the whale crimes unit. Tina? No. You're right. We can just ask Mom and Dad what to do with it. They're pretty cool. Whoa, whoa, whoa, Tina, you're not telling Mom or Dad or anybody, do you hear me? We found it, we're the ones who are gonna get rich, okay? But it's illegal. Tina, sweetie... Yeah? Guess what? I got a secret. Hmm? Okay. Okay, ready? You want to hear the secret? Yeah, what is it? Ah! We're selling it! (quietly): Tina, tell me the secret. (grunts) Juicy. Good morning, parents! And good morning to you, partners in victimless crime. Uhhhh... What do you think the odds are that Felix will send a plumber today? Twenty-twenty! Wait, is that an odd? Speaking of odd, uh, yesterday, on the beach, Gene, Louise and I found a... Sister! A word? What the hell was that? You're gonna blow our whole operation. I'm sorry, Louise; I just wanted to get Mom and Dad's advice about whether we should tell Mom and Dad. (groans) I mean, whales are endangered, so... Just-just find a whale to give your money to when this is all over, okay? Start a whale scholarship or something! (muffled): Greetings, sisters. Gene, what are you nibbling on? Is that a piece of the lump? Um, I'm protecting it. Give it to me. Mm-mm... Give it to me... Mm-mm. You spit it out. Mm-mm. Mm. You spit it out. Open up that craw! Mm-mm. Uh-uh. And spit it out! Listen up, blubber lover, Uh-huh. you use your share to buy more ambergris... that's the plan, remember? (mumbles) Oh, all right! God, you're like a goat. I am like a goat! Listen, I thought of a connection who can help us move this stuff. Who? The hardest, most ruthless criminal we know. Hi, Mickey! Hey, Mickey. Kids, what a nice surprise! Nice gig. Yep. The "Queezy Queen." It's good honest work. Pull the lever, push the lever, "you have to be this tall," and that is it. Uh-huh. Yep! Just push and pull. Very Zahn. You mean "Zen"? Zahn. Steve Zahn. He's an actor I admire. Love that guy! Hey, Mickey, uh, can we talk to you in private for a second? Sure, sure, sure. Step into my office. Like it? You guys comfortable? Can I get anybody a water? We're good. Mickey, what would you say if I told you somebody found something... I'm in. Hold on. There's more. Oh, great. So, there's this thing that comes out of whales' butts called ambergris. But little problem: It's illegal to buy and sell. Enter, you. Okay, gang, I'm intrigued. But I don't know... I left the criminal life behind. Good for you. I used to be a thumbsucker and then I stopped, so I get it. Mickey, Mickey, Mickey, Mickey! Come on, man. It's one last job. This is my last job. This is my last job moment. This is the one I do and then I die or go to jail at the end. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! This is the one you do and then you are golden. Oh, okay. If I help, I'd get some kind of finder's fee, right? Maybe, like, uh... I don't know, ten percent? What?! I mean... yeah, sure. That would help me buy my bar. I want to get a bunch of monkeys. Call it the Monkey Bar. Or... ooh... or crows! I could call it the Bar with All the Crows. That's beautiful, Mickey. I love your dreams. (children screaming) Oh, I got to go, I got to go. Sorry, kids! Bonus round, right? I'm back! Felix. Hi. Are you here to tell us the plumber is coming? To fix the hot brown water? No. Because the hot brown water is just the tip of the hot brown iceberg. I was just about to call the plumber. Then I thought, "That's thinking small." Calling a plumber is thinking small? Tiny! We're gonna give your bathroom a total remodel. Oh! Wow. The bathroom's fine. It's just the water that needs to be not brown. Yep! A total renovación! My brother will flip. He'll be like, "Whoa!" And I'll be like, "Yeah! Calvin! I friggin' did it!" And then he'll be like, "Oh, that's nice." Um... So where is the latrine? Let me see it. Over there. It's-it's over there. Oh, God! It's horrible! It's not that bad. Wait, let me look at it one more time. Oh, my God! Linda: Oh! First, we're gonna tear everything out. Yeah! Then we're gonna burn that sad little poop corner to the ground. Yeah, burn it! Oh. I don't think that's... Burn, baby, burn! No. And, in its place, we will build a bathroom where anything can happen. (Linda gasps in awe) Babies will be born! Aw, babies. All right. Men will die! They're gonna die. Maybe just fix the plumbing and then do the... It's a new day, people. It's a new day. You can't hurt us again, bathroom! Never again! Oh, my God. Sleep tight, little ambergris lump. Good night, ambergris. (kissing) Mmm... Gene, no licking! Hey, what?! The lump made the first move! I'll tuck it in. Ow. Everyone say good night without touching it or licking it or hurting its value on the black market. Say good night! Good night. Good night. Okay, now walk away. Ambergris, I'm gonna eat some old cheese, but I'll be thinking of you. (creaking) What? Who's there? What's that? Pretty, pretty, pretty. (cackling) Thirty. Thousand. Dollars. Thirty. Thousand. Dollars. (quiet crazed laughter) Put it on the boat, Hovig. Put the tile on the boat. Hovig, calm down. You know me; I'm not gonna burn you on this. Ho... Talk to him, Linda, please. Hovig, listen to me. He won't burn you. Wait, wait, who's Hovig? Felix, how long is this gonna take? We need a bathroom. Some people come here just for the bathroom. And I say, "Customers only," then they buy a soda. Bob, shh, it's the tile guy, come on. Okay, if you could just give me a ballpark of when this will be done... Okay. Thank you, Hovig! I love you, honey! She's great with Hovig. Did you sleep at all last night, Louise? Sleep? Ha. Soon I'll have people who do my sleeping for me! (phone rings) Bob's Burgers! Whoa. Louise, it's Mickey! Oh, hi, girl who sits behind me in math class. What? No, no, it's Mickey! Brown hair? Hands a little bit small, out of proportion with his body? Yeah, yeah, what's the good word, math class friend? Oh! You're being discreet. I should do that. Anyway, good news: I found somebody to move the ambergris! (quietly): You did? Who? You're not gonna believe it, the fried dough guy. He works right near the Queezy Queen. Really? You found someone at Wonder Wharf? Uh, don't be alarmed but pretty much everyone working at Wonder Wharf is a criminal. Even Sally the snow cone lady? Are you kidding? Especially Sally the snow cone lady. Okay. Well, let's go see your guy. Whoa, whoa, whoa, compadre. I-I got to wait till my next break. Can we say 3:00-ish? You want to meet here and then we'll head over and see the Nose? Who's the Nose? That's my guy. He's got an amazing sense of smell. Oh, that's why they call him the Nose! I just got it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And...? Well, he can verify the ambergris, and if he likes what he smells, he'll buy it off you right on the spot. Ten percent to me, we go our separate ways. Or hang out! I don't know what you guys are up to, but I'm just... Gotta go. Wait for further instruction. Bye! Kids meeting. Upstairs. Now. We've been having a lot of kid meetings. This is why we need a conference room. Mickey told me the name of his connect and where he works, so it's sayonara, Mickey! What are you saying, Louise? We're cutting out Mickey? He cut himself out by giving us the information. It's not my fault he's bad at being a criminal. But Mickey was gonna use that money to go straight. He was gonna open that straight bar. Okay, Tina, you're too emotional. You just bought yourself a ticket to Not-Goingsville. Gene, let's go. Here, I'll hold the lump. No way, Gene. I've seen how you hold it... in your mouth. It needs to be stored at mouth temperature! You know what? I'm going alone! I'm taking charge so you two won't screw this up! You want to end up like Mickey? Five-foot-ten? Comfortable in his own skin? No! Cut out! Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut! Aah! This stuff is making you crazy! It's tearing us apart! Why couldn't that whale have pooped three equally sized poops like I do! Gene: This isn't like you, Louise. You used to be nice, sort of. If you're gonna sell that thing, then you're doing it alone. Yes, that's the plan. That's exactly what I'm doing. (grunting) Wh-What are you doing?   (groans) You don't walk into a deal just holding the stuff. You tape it to your back. Watch a movie! Okay. Let me get that for you. Thank you. (hums a tune) The tape doesn't stick. Stay still. I'll get the duct tape Dad uses to lock the front door at night. It's ready. Ambergris lump secured? Check. Sample for The Nose to test? Check. I'm leaving here a girl with a hunch on her back, but I'm coming back a girl with a whole hunch of money. I'm mad, but I'm still gonna wish you good luck! (singsongy): I got the deejay... Yay! Ah, the unveiling party; It's gonna be amazing! Unveiling party? Party time! We don't even have a bathroom that works, and you're planning a party? By the way, the deejay might have to stay with you. What?! Yes. He's Brazilian, though, so, uh... very cool. No... Felix, no. The burlesque girls, you know what, let's just have them dancing on the tables and the counter. Oh, burlesque girls! Classy! Very classy. Please, sir, don't encourage this. You're not in... You know what? What? You know what we're gonna do? We're gonna have a plumbing party, all right? With a licensed plumber. To fix the bathroom. Not a deejay, no burlesque show. Okay. A plumber to fix the pipe! Bobby! So no girls, then? Or still girls? It's still happening. I'll put you on the list. (sizzling) Fried dough? Are you The Nose? That's what they call me. What do they call you, Humpback Whacky Eyes? Listen, doughboy, I came to talk to you about real dough. Ah, I see. You're, uh, you're early. And you're, uh, rather tiny. Yeah, yeah, I'm a little girl. Sorry I'm not huge and old. Wh-Where's Mickey? Uh, Mickey sends his regrets, and, uh, this... hearty handshake. Ugh! You put something gross in my hand! Oh. Okay. (sniffs) Sweet Georgia O'Keeffe! This is finely aged. (sniffs) You have the rest of it with you? Well, do you have the money? (whispers): I want $30,000! Well, I don't have it on me. Then I don't have the stuff, (laughs): Do I, Nose? Oh, you know what? I just remembered. I want to the ATM yesterday. I have about $30,000 on me. Okay, great, great! Let's do this. All right, count of three, I give you the money, you give me the ambergris. Sounds good. Okay. One... Okay. ...two... three! (grunts) It's huge! 12 dollars?! Oh, is it? Are you robbing me? Yeah... What?! Mickey's not here. You're very small. It just makes sense. Yeah, okay, I get it, I get it. But what if I do this! Nope. Doesn't work. Remember? You're small? You have to give it back! Mmm, hey, this smells like a cantaloupe wrapped in dirty socks. It's a cantaloupe wrapped in dirty socks! (gasps) Tina! Stay still. I'll get the duct tape Dad uses to lock the front door at night. Tina: Dear Louise and/or The Nose, this is for your own good. Also, please return the cantaloupe and the socks. Love, Tina. (Louise screams) (sniffing) You know, they're not that dirty... you can get another day out of these, quite frankly. Okay, okay, okay, if I were a double-dealing goody-goody with a treasure, where would I go? Is this a riddle? No. Kid's book? No. And I wasn't talking to you, Nose. Sorry! Don't you have some dough to fry? Easy there, Blinky. I don't have dough to fry; I get to fry dough. This is a dream job. I never realized sinks could be so sexy. Oh, yes... sinks are the supermodels of the bathroom, as I like to say. Yeah! I call this one "Sinky Crawford." (both chuckling) Sinky Craw... Do you? Yeah. Do you? Yeah! That's great. That's so great. Get it? Sink... Ha-ha-ha-ha! Like... Ha-ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha. Ha...! I am so sick of your attitude. Bob: Oh, yeah, it's my fault. Come here, Bob... Bobby, wait, I didn't mean that. Bobby! Oh, my God!  Look at this one!  Oh, yeah! Hubba hubba. Are you sure we should do this, T? Yes. I know how we can still use the lump for good. Mickey can sell it and open his bar. The bar with the monkeys and the crows! It's what the world needs now! Don't worry about that sound... that's nothin'! (brief whirr) That one, ooh, that's new. I got to report that one. (panting): Mickey... Louise... Hi. she's meeting with the Nose right now. Uh-oh. (chuckles) Crossed wires alert. No. Louise cut you out. She cheated you. (inhales) Ooh, that stings. But I'm giving you the lump, all of it. You can use the money to go straight. Buy a juicer... it'll change your mornings. Or cowboy boots. Mm, change your evenings. I'm honored, and I accept your offer. And I know exactly how I'm gonna go straight. Yeah, your dream... the Monkey and/or Crow Bar. Nope. I'm gonna use the money to buy a tank. Uh-huh... And then I could use the tank Uh-huh. to rob a bank! Uh... Oh. I'll be Mickey Tank-Bank! No! Yes! Mickey Tank-Bank! Aah! I shouldn't have come here! Why, whale? Why did you curse us with this poop or wax or whatever it is? Aah! There's only one thing to do: We have to destroy the ambergris. Whoa, hey, wait-wait-wait! I was just getting to the "going straight" thing. I'm gonna do that after the bank. Tina, where are you going? Louise: Oh, my God, there she is! (both panting) Tina! Sister! Ah, my only sister, there you are. Hi, Tina. We haven't met yet, but I really want that thing you're holding. Everybody get back! I'm gonna throw the ambergris in the water. No! Whatever you do, don't throw it in the water. Anything but the water! Wait. Doesn't ambergris float? Oh. (frustrated yell) Tina: No! Aah! Stop her! She stole my baby! Seagulls! Swarm attack! Aah! I thought that would work. Hot... hot pier! Ooh! Ah! Ow! Ow! (Tina yelling) Aw... Louise: We got her. Nowhere else to go, Tina. Hand it over. I want that money! (jabbering, growling) What? What part of (jabbering, growling) don't you understand?! (panicked grunting, gasping) Tina: Huh-huh. (sizzling) Mmm, ah! (deep, distorted gasping)  (slow, rhythmic whooshing) (sizzling) (Tina's sighs with relief) It's for the best. Can I have the socks and cantaloupe back? I'll check in about it later. (lively Latin music playing) Everybody having a good time? I... know you are! Felix: Can you drape it more casually? Like, "Oh, I'm just a ribbon, no big deal." Uh, sure, yeah. How's this? Beautiful. Hey... so, I had a little time to think, and I... guess I was a tiny bit out of control the other day, you know, with the, uh... (snorts) You know, uh, the ambergris. Huh. I didn't notice. Oh, seriously? No, I noticed. Oh. You were really, really out of control. I don't know, I miss twitch-face Louise. Well, Gene, that's what happens when you fry $30,000 in hot oil! There it is... there's Twitchy. I'm fine. I'm good. I'm just twitching to the music. So, is this, uh, the unveiling? Bob: Yep. How's it looking? Haven't seen it. Not feeling great about that. Doesn't seem to matter to anybody. The deejay slept in my living room. Bob! Bob: Sergio. Hey, Mr. Fisch. Wine? Calvin. Welcome. Was it easy to get in? I left your name at the door. Not bad, huh? You know, I'm kind of glad the burlesque dancers didn't show. Heh! They didn't want to dance at a bathroom party. What are they, royalty? Anyway, let's unveil this baby. Okay, uh... (clears throat) Oh, God, I'm nervous. (sighs anxiously) The new, improved Bob's-Restaurant- that-sells-burgers ba-throom! Oh, my God. Oh... my God. Which is the sink? Which is the toilet? I'd pee in that. Or that. It doesn't quite match the rest of the restaurant. Calm down, Bob. I didn't forget you and your concerns. So the water works? Oh, was that one of your concerns? Yeah. It was. Hold that thought. Calvin... Hmm? what do you think? Do you love it or do you love it? What were my choices again? You hate it. No. You do. You hate it. You hate it, too, Bob, don't you? Yes, I do, hate it. You think it's stupid. Too gaudy. Too much black! Not all those things. You never support me! Felix, you're being dramatic. I'm not being dramatic! I just feel like I'm gonna throw up my heart and my head will fly away like a bird! So, you got your bathroom done. Felix: I'm gonna rip it all out! Mr. Fischoeder, can you do something about this? What, Felix? Oh. Yes. Step aside. Watch this. (rhythmic beat) Now you guys say: It's Felix, (others join in): It's Felix, it's Felix, it's Felix, it's Felix, Come on, Bob. it's Felix, it's Felix... (continuing in rhythm)  Who's that funny little wormy guy  Who poked out his brother's eye? It's Felix  It's Felix, and Felix is Mommy's favorite  That's me!  Yeah! Works every time. My mother played bongos. Thank you. Bob, you were flat. I was just saying words. You can't be flat when you're talking. You're flat. You're flat right now. (clears throat) You're welcome. Thank you, Felix. Get a load of these two. Siblings, right? I'm glad we never fight or act crazy. So, who's gonna help me out here and lift me up so I can pee in that weird round thing? Gene: That's Teddy! Deejay: Everybody having a good time? (dance music playing) LINDA: Yay! Deejay: I know you are! Linda: Party time! Deejay: Oh...! Hey...! Whoa...! Linda: Yeah! Deejay: Rio de Janeiro is where I'm from. Linda: Hmm! Yeah! Deejay: For bathroom unveiling... today!  Bathroom party...  Linda: Yeah!  Bathroom party, everybody...  Deejay: City of God... that's my backyard!  Bathroom party...  Bathroom party  Everyb...  © 2014 20TH CENTURY FOX TELEVISION
(grunting) Linda: Tina, good. Louise, eh. Gene, get the back a little. Back, back, up, down, side, side, go, go! And... time. Brushes down! Yuck! What was that stuff?! Toothpaste. So that's toothpaste! All right, now hurry up and floss like you've been flossing every day for the past six months. Go. We don't have any floss. We all agreed not to get food between our teeth. Maybe Dr. Yap won't notice. Oh, he'll notice. Dr. Yap notices everything. He's like an eagle soaring through your mouth. You know, I think I'm gonna sit this one out today. Not so fast, Miss Missy. Those teeth are gonna get cleaned twice a year until Dr. Yap stops taking our insurance. Why do we even have to get our teeth cleaned? What kind of a racket is that? Louise, we know you hate going to the dentist, but come on, can we have this go smoothly just one time? Sure, sure. Let me go get my coat. She's gonna lock herself in her room! Don't make me tackle you! (thud, groan) Bob: Got her foot. Damn it! Spotless, as always, Tina. You know, we don't always have to make this about business. I'm more than just a mouthful of perfect teeth. And off you go. (creaking) All right, all set. I feel violated. Maybe a toy would help? Okay. You like that toy basket? Mm-hmm. Toy basket is what it's all about! Come on, cup n' ball, or pirate tattoo! Ooh! Ah, the old get-all-the-BBs into-all-the-holes game. A classic. I'll master this when I should be brushing my teeth. Gene, that's not really the idea. Bup, bup, bup. Bup. Got the toy, gonna go. Well, well, well. They haven't ripped up your dental license yet, huh, Dr. Yap? What's it made out of? Is it hard to rip? Ah, hello, Louise. Still afraid of the dentist? Afraid?! I'm not afraid! You're afraid! You reek of fear! Whatever you say. (coughs): Scaredy-cat! Look, how about I just sit in that chair for the allotted time, flip through a nature mag, and you can still get your easy money? Nope. Ugh! Fine. But you're in and out in two minutes, or I start biting. No loitering! Scrape a gum, I slap your face, got it? I know the rules, Louise. You're the boss. Just in case you forgot. All right. We need you to open your mouth. Okay, now just, uh... You're doing great. Just, the opposite of what I've asked you to do. Just open it. Are we done? Almost. Just... Aah. There you go. Aah. Great, great. Perfect, tiny opening I can see through. (breathing loudly) Hmm. Ow! That was fair. That was fair. That was my bad. I didn't... You need to talk to me! You're right. I know. It was my fault. I just... You got real quiet! No, I know. Bob, we have a situation. Did Louise hit you? Yes, but that's not the problem. She's got a cavity. Wow. So, oh, Louise got her first cavity. (laughing): Yeah, and it's a doozy. Oh, it's so bad. Look, I have a cancellation. I can do the filling right now. Boom, bam. (clicks tongue) Hmm. Yeah, maybe a surprise attack is best. This isn't gonna be easy. (sighs) (whispering): I don't want to go back in there. I really don't want to go back in there, Bob. Listen. Mm-hmm? You can do this. Yup. Yup. All right? Okay. So, I'll see you later? Yup. Yup. All right. (exhales loudly) I need to stretch out a little bit. Yup. You know, I'm just gonna do a little... (sighs)... trivial touchup on that second molar. What the hell's all that for? Um... You have a... (quietly): Cavity. A cavity?! No, no, I'm not getting a filling! Hey, fill this! Hey! Hey! You back off! (shrieks) (shrieks) DR. YAP (shrieking): I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Sorry! It's fun in there. It's fun. Here's what's gonna happen, okay? I'm going out this window, and that's the last you'll ever see of these teeth. Your parents will bring you back, Louise. You have a cavity. Let 'em. I'll keep running! Ho-ho, they'll never find me. You're gonna wait ten... Hey! (shrieks) You're gonna wait ten minutes till you tell my dad I'm gone. This is sil... I... What did I just say?! Okay! All right! Ten minutes. I'm sorry. Adios, Yap! She's gone! She ran away! What?! She told me to wait ten minutes before I told you. But I'm a grown man, and she's a little girl, so I waited eight! You waited eight minutes to tell me my daughter ran away?! Don't tell Louise I didn't wait the full ten. Maybe she ran away into the car. Oh, no, she's gone. Oh, my God. (shouting): Louise! Dad, you're scaring everyone. Oh, sorry. Yeah. (shouting): Louise! (birds screeching) Aah. Aah. Oh, I can't believe my baby ran away! We haven't found her yet, but we're going to. Aah. I don't know. She is pretty small when she crouches down. She could be anywhere by now, and in need of semi-urgent dental care! She could have fallen into a crevasse! Do we have those, Bobby? How deep are they? Oh, God. She has to come home. I mean, she's nine years old. It's not like she's thought this through. (crow cawing) (birds singing) Exactly where I left it. Oh. Right. (laughs) Candy cell phone. I was only seven when I packed this go bag. I guess I was just a kid back then. (phone ringing) Hello? Louise, is that you? Are you dead?! Oh, I'm alive and well, and I plan to stay that way. And don't bother tracing this call, 'cause I'm not gonna be on long enough. Louise, honey, come home! Only if you call off that lunatic, Dr. Yap! Louise, it's your father. Just come home and get the stupid filling. Sorry, Dad, that's not gonna happen. So, uh, oh, geez, I guess this is good-bye. Not how I imagined it. What? Good-bye? What do you mean? We're your family! Well, Mom, sometimes these things just don't work out. Louise, don't... No, Louise, don't go... So, Ms. Black, you want to reserve the Duchess Suite for an indefinite stay, and you have one Mr. Bob Belcher's credit card. Now all I need to complete this check-in is an adult. Yeah. I believe this photo I.D. says I'm an adult. Yes. Yeah. It says you're 43. Mm-hmm. But it's written in pencil. And the background says "Wagstaff School Picture Day." Wagstaff was my platoon in 'Nam. Oh, man, they said there'd be people like you when I came back. Uh-huh. Serving my country, protecting your ass. I'm going to have to call the police now. What? So they can give you a ride home. Good-bye. (doorbell rings) (multiple locks clicking open) (door creaks shut, lock clicks open) Louise, what a surprise! I'm so glad it's you and not a m*rder*r. Nope. Just me, as planned. Remember? No. Aunt Gayle, I wrote you weeks ago about staying with you. Oh, that darn mailman must be taking my letters! If that's his way of getting me to notice him, it's kind of working. You remember the cats? (meowing) Do I? There's this one and that one. Oh, the-the other one! Oh, they like you. The farther they walk away from you, the more they like you. What's, uh... what's going on with the plastic situation over here? Are you renovating your bed? Ah, I'm not such a good sleeper so I kind of invented this little game where I'm the last living person in the world. Oh. Does that help, or...? Yeah! This keeps out the radiation and the mutant carnivores that prowl the earth at night, and I sleep like a baby. Okay. Well, that's great. I'm gonna go hit the can. Well, I'll just call your mom and let her know you got here safely. No, no, no, no, do not do that. My mom said for you to only call her if I don't get here safely. Makes sense. Mm-hmm. In case I have to keep running, Cuba's that way. I can just take a... Ow! Ow! Ow! (sucks in through teeth) Suck it up! (phone ringing) Hello? Gayle, it's Linda. Hey, Lin, it's me, Gayle. Yeah, I-I know, hon. I called you. Oh. Okay. Listen, have you seen Louise? Yeah, she's here at my place. Oh, thank God. Bob, she's at Gayle's. Yeah, it's that scheduled visit I didn't know about. She ran away, Gayle. (gasps) Oh, my. Where'd she go?! She's at your house, hon. Oh, right, right. She's afraid of the dentist. She got a cavity, and she doesn't want to get a filling. Well, who does? Okay, well, uh, we'll come pick her up, but don't tell her, or she'll run. Oh, good thinking, Lin. You're the smart one, I'm the hot one. No. That little dental dodger. How come Louise gets to run away? She doesn't get to run away. I want to run away! Yeah, I could stand to run away. It could be chapter four of my memoir, right after chapter three: "Going to the Dentist." No one else is running away. We just need Louise to get that filling. Good luck with that. Maybe it's time for a little creative parenting. Wait. What do we do, Lin... bribe her to get the filling? Bribe Louise? We don't have that kind of money. But if she lost a bet... I don't know. What's the bet? Pack your bags, kids. You're running away, too! Yay! Yay! (doorbell rings, cat purrs) What the...? What are you guys...? Guess who else is running away. Us. Gene and myself. What about Mom and Dad? They dropped us off. I'm not coming home! I know. Stay at your Aunt Gayle's! Great. I will. Forever. Thanks. (laughs) I bet you can't last the weekend without Gayle driving you nuts! Bet I can. I love it here! Yeah, care to make a wager? Sure! I'll tell you what. If you last the whole weekend, you don't have to get the filling. But if you crack, if you can't hack it, you get the drillin' and the fillin'. Deal? Of course it's a deal! I can stay here till I'm 30! It's the most fun studio apartment in the world! This better work. It's gonna work 'cause we're gonna cheat. We got a man on the inside. (phone buzzing) "Hi, Mom. Ready when you are. It's Tina." (phone buzzing) "Tina, your daughter, Tina." Okay. It's time to text Tina her first instructions. We're gonna raise Gayle's crazy meter to un-fun levels. Super secret-style, like a ninja. You know, this whole situation is absurd. Hey, you got to fight crazy with crazy. Well, Louise gets this from your side of the family. (laughing): You don't think I know that? (cackling) What are you doing? Stop that. (cackling)   (phone buzzes) (grunting) Go in the hole, BBs! Aah! I was so close! What do you have against novelty amusements, cat?! (humming) Hi, Aunt Gayle. So, um, we were wondering if you'd read us your poetry. Uh, what? Really? What? You kids want to hear my poetry? Tina! Oh, wonderful, wonderful! What's happening? (clearing her throat) "Happy Things We Should Send lnto Space." A jar of mayo. Magazine clippings of Scott Baio. That song that starts with "Day-O"... Little cat, you're just like me. You go outside and squat to pee. (shouting): Squat! Squat! Squat! Squat! (clapping) Yeah! (whoops) Okay. That's... Oh, ah... we got to stop. But I'm not done. (shouting): Squat! The end. Great poems, Aunt Gayle. Okay, I'll take that. Thank you. Wait. But I have so many more! And I want to read them! Later. Alone. So I don't disturb anyone when I go, "Mmm. Uh-huh. Well put. Devastating." (phone buzzing) LINDA: Oh, poopsicles! Louise outflanked us. I think we got to turn up the heat. You know, I haven't read any parenting books, but I'm pretty sure this wouldn't be in there. Parenting books? There are parenting books? Um... I thought they were... that was a joke. Well, there are parenting books. Huh. I should write a book. I'd call it Hey, You, I Saw That. Put it Back! That's... Yeah. Yup, you should do that. I know, right? Make a fortune. Mm-hmm. Hey, Aunt Gayle, do your cats' claw caps come in other colors? What, their Pretty Paws? (purring and mewing) Of course! I got lots of colors. It's just maybe Jean Paw'd Van Damme would be happier in pastel colors. It is spring, after all. (gasps) You're so right. Oh, Pink Eye and Mr. Business, you must be so embarrassed that you're still in winter colors. Let's change 'em up! We'll all help. Yeah! If we all pitch in, it'll only take a few hours. I'm sure you guys got it covered. I'm just gonna go... Cat nail salon! Louise, you hold Mr. Business. Hurry, hurry. Why do I have to have Mr. Business? He's the worst one. Gene, you-you switch with me. Hell no. Oh, yeah. Oh, wrap 'em up with these towels, 'cause when we take the old Pretty Paws off, they tend to go for the eyes. Ah! No, just round 'em up. Just close your eyes and dive on 'em. Thanks so much for helping, kids. Now that I made 'em all pretty, the pound will have to give me that fourth cat. (yawns) Ah, time to get some shut-eye. (shrieking) The apocalypse is upon us! Why?! Why must the world end right when I'm getting sleepy?! What's happening? Oh, it's how she sleeps. Don't worry about it. But there is an apocalypse. Ah! Every human is dead except for me! Especially the men! So there's no men! So it's okay to sleep alone. Good night, kids. Night, Aunt Gayle. Gayle had 'em in the cat salon for hours. Well, Louise has to be cracking a little, right? But we need to push her over the top. Hmm. Wait, wait, wait. Remember when Gayle hosted a game night and made us play the board game she invented? Gayle Force Winds? Yes! Gayle Force Winds! We should get the kids to play that. It's horrible. The rules don't make any sense, it takes all day to play it... Yes! Gayle Force Winds will drive Louise nuts. All right, s*x time! Oh, my God, right. We can do that, 'cause they-they're gone. Yeah... Let's do it. (chuckling): Yeah. Let's go! You want me to win. Yes, I did it! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha. Eh, hmm. So, what do you kids want to do today? You're looking at it, babe. Okay, great. How does butter sound for lunch? (phone vibrates) What, am I gonna say no to a butter lunch? Hmm. Hey, Aunt Gayle, I wish there was a board game that we could play that stimulates the imagination but that was too good for the major board game companies to even touch. (gasps) I made a board game that stimulates the imagination but that was too good for the major board game companies to even touch! Oh, I got to make room. (grunting) Uh, what's happening now? Why are you looking at me? I'm on the same moving couch as you. So if Louise makes it to tomorrow morning, she doesn't have to get the filling? Right. But if Gayle's craziness drives her out, she loses. Mm-hmm. And yet she wins 'cause her cavity will be filled. That's right. Pretty high-level parenting. Yeah. We know what we're doing, Teddy. Pretty badass. But what if Louise flies the coop and just goes somewhere else? Oh... Whoa. You didn't even think of that, Bobby? Well, I mean, it's been... You have no contingency plan in place? I... Teddy, it's been mostly Linda's thing. So we'll, uh... we'll stake out Gayle's apartment. Oh, a stakeout. That sounds fun! Hey! Get takeout for your stakeout. Huh? Maybe you could order steak, have a takeout-steak stakeout. I'll get the menus! It's called Gayle Force Winds. It's more than just a board game. It's about love and war and fantasy and plagues and fashion. Cool. So how do we play it? Princess Gayle must save the five realms of Worldlandia from the evil winds sent by the wicked sorceress, Rebecca, who thinks she's so cute. She lives upstairs. Louise, you go first. Uh-oh, you landed in Sponge'in Dungeon. You got to sit with this wet sponge on your head for 30 minutes. (quietly): This game seems pretty weird. Maybe we should go home. I'd rather sit here with a wet sponge on my head all day than get that stupid filling. Linda: Nice romantic stakeout. What is that smell? Oh. Bobby, Linda, what are you doing here? Teddy? What are you doing here? I was just gonna park over there for a few hours and then, uh, I happened to see you guys were here, and I thought I'd just kind of... Wait, are you crashing our stakeout? What? No. I brought pizza! Ooh, pizza. Hand it over. So what'd I miss? You guys taking copious notes? Can you... can... Do you mind both just scooting up (Linda and Bob grunt) just a little bit? A little more. (Linda and Bob grunt) Is that it? Mmm. That's as far as it can go? Should we all just move over to my truck? Teddy. Uh, you know what, I'm fine. I'll make it work. Can you mind cracking a window? Gene: Aw, man! I landed in Cold Sore-ia. (grumbles) Oh, that's hard. You can ask Tina for some of her magic ointment. But I clucked like an enchanted chicken for 20 minutes to get this magic ointment. I don't know... Uh-oh. Your indecision has upset the Gayle Force Winds. (whooshing sounds) (grunts) Everyone has to start over! No! We've been playing this game for six hours and no one has even made it past the Cliffs of Huxtable! (moans) That cavity's really bothering you, Louise. What's it to you? Whose side are you on? Don't you want me to win? Stay cool. I'm on your side. Team Louise all the way. Why are you talking like that? Like what? This is how I always talk. Wait, now I don't remember how I talk. Is this how I sound? Never mind. Just help me get past Rebecca's monkey army. (phone vibrates) Oh... Tina says Louise is losing it. (Teddy snoring) Hopefully our little girl's about to snap. (chuckles) Yeah, let's hope it's soon. Teddy's apnea is making me sick. (snoring) (snoring stops) (coughing) Oh, God. Thank God. That one was, like, six seconds. He's breathing again. I mean, how lo... how long before you die? (birds chirping) I did it. I made it through the weekend. I don't have to get the filling! I win, I win! Let's all celebrate with more sleep and no more talking. Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm! Morning, sleepyheads. Oh, my God, did we sleep through the night? We sure did. Never slept better. Linda. Linda. Wha... Did you know that you snore? What happened? Did we win? What-What's going on? It's morning. Damn it. That little bugger pulled it off. She beat us. (grunts) That's not an option, Lin. She needs to get that filling or else her teeth are gonna fall out. Okay. I was hoping it wouldn't come to this. We're gonna have to make our baby feel some pain. Oh, wow. Y-You did it, Louise! How about a victory breakfast of ice cream? Thanks, T, that's a great idea. (Louise screaming) My baby! (sobs) Our baby! We had to do it. (crying) It was the only way! (cries) (screaming) You gonna finish that? (doorbell rings) Make it stop, make it stop! Knock, knock, time to pick up some runaways. Ow, ow, ow, (gps), no, what's wrong, Louise? ow, ow, ow. She ate a bite of ice cream, and I guess it upset her cavity. Aw. Louise couldn't handle her high. Why-why is Teddy here? Yeah. Why are any of us here? Think about that. Whoa. You kids got further in Gayle Force Winds than I thought you would. Wait, you knew we were playing Gayle Force Winds? Ow. Um, I-I didn't. I just, um... What-What's, uh... what's Gayle Force Winds? Oh, now I get it. You guys were behind all of this. You cheated! How could you?! Ow! Tina helped us cheat! What?! Mom! Sorry, it's true. We cheated because we love you, honey. Yeah. Oh, that is disgusting. I hate you guys right no I can't believe it. Louise, you got to get that filling. I'm fine! Ow! Honey, now you listen to me. I know you're afraid. I'm not afraid! Oh... Aw, screw it! I'm afraid, I'm afraid! I know a little something about fear. You've seen my life. Yeah. It's bad. So why don't you let Aunt Gayle help you get through this, okay? We're gonna turn your fear-believe into make-belie. That's not gonna work. (moans, hisses) Let's do it. Great! Now, what character do you want to play? (dramatic orchestral music playing) (moans, hisses) You've been briefed of the situation. I have. This is the asset I spoke about. Is the asset willing to do whatever's necessary to save the universe? She is. And the asset promises not to... bite me during the procedure? The asset promises. Then why the hell are we out here wasting time, damn it?! Let's go! Let's men! Sector eight, clear! Sectors ninend ten, clear! Ow. That pain is a toxin from our enemy's ice cream serum. The antidote is in this needle. Ooh! Oh... Ooh, I don't know... Okay, no! You must. The whole universe is counting on you, kid. (sighs) Proceed. Ow! Very good. You should be completely numb in just a few seconds. Now, this might look like ordinary porcelain filling from a sad, lonely dentist's office, but this is a microchip of our plans for the most amazing weapon system ever. (whirring) Oh, wait. Wait a minute. Oh, no! Our enemies are here! (mimicking g*nshots) Ah! (strained): Louise, the mission must go on. Do it! (drilling) Get him! Cover me, Bobby! Go, go, go! Grenade! (mimics expl*si*n) Ah! Flamethrower! Okay... Okay, all right, all right. (screaming) I'm hit! I'm hit! I'm taking fire here! You got to call in some air support! This is crazy! We get the point! Geez. We got you. Okay. You may have sh*t me too many times, but our cause will never die. You did it, Louise. I did it? You did it. And it didn't... inconvenience... anyone... at all. (exhales) I'll hug him back to life! (grunting) Okay, I'm fine. Yeah, yeah, Tina, he's fine. Don't do that. Okay. No. Almost there! Tina, let-let him go. Almost there! Tina, get up. (mimicking g*nshots) When you get to the toy basket, get the squirt ring! The squirt ring! The future depends on it. Hey, you were good in there. You, too. I'd do a mission with you anytime. I hate to say it, but I think Gayle out-parented us. Maybe we should let her watch the kids more often. Oh, maybe Gayle could move in with us, be our full-time nanny. I'm gonna call your bluff on that. Yes. No. No, no. Too late. It's done. See you at home, Gayle. Gotcha! (groans) "Happy Things We Should Send lnto Space." A jar of mayo. Magazine clippings of Scott Baio. That song that starts with "Day-O." Little cat, you're just like me. You go outside and squat to pee. Squat! Squat! Squat! Squat!

Bob: That's weird. Someone took  the mop part off this mop. Oh, my God. No! Sorry, Dad, I took it. I'm going out for cheerleader, and I needed some practice pom-poms. Oh, Gene, for my other pom-pom, I borrowed your Rasta wig. Not cool, mon. It's okay. So, Tina, you're going out for cheerleader! That's exciting. Yeah. At wrestling matches, cheerleaders are only ten feet from the action. When things get sweaty, that's the splash zone. I-I don't know. Isn't cheerleading kind of, well, silly? Plus, do you really want to get splashed by that? Yes. Oh. Don't you? What are you talking about? Cheerleaders help the team win by jumping around and touching their toes and asking if you're ready and then they say, "Okay!" And they whip the crowd into a frenzy by spelling words. W-O-R-D-S! Words! Lin, you're talking like you were a cheerleader. What? I was! Well, my best friend Monica was. So I was right there in the entourage. People were like, "Hey, let's go to cheerleader practice." And I would be like, "Okay, I'll drive you." Tryouts are today. I didn't want to tell you guys till I felt ready, so I've been practicing in my closet. Tina, do you really think you're the cheerleader type? Bob, be supportive. Come on, what cheer you gonna do for the tryout? Let's go, ignite, the Wagstaff team is dynamite. Okay, we're ready. Let's hear you do it. I just did it. Oh. Oh. Of course you did. Tina, honey, if you don't make it, it's okay. In fact, sometimes cheerleaders are not the nicest people. What? My friend Monica... one time, she ditched me at the food court to hang out with the other cheerleaders. (groans) I had so many free samples of sesame chicken, I can't eat it to this day. You ate sesame chicken last night, Lin. I know, but I didn't like it. Damn you, Monica! Oh, my God. Okay! Gene, Louise, why don't you go to tryouts to support Tina? I'm sure she could use it. Okay. Oh, no way. I'm busy. By the way, with a cartwheel, are your hands or your face supposed to touch the ground first? Actually, I'll make time. Girl (unsteadily): We are the Whalers! It's true! We're gonna sink our hooks in you! Whalers! Oh... God. Great job. (quietly): I hate cheerleading. Her pom-poms make me want to vom-vom. She's in my math class and she makes me sad. I scored her a 4.7. We don't have a point system, Todd. I use a personal point system. Oh, great. Next! Hi, I'm Tina. Gene: Yay, Tina! Go, Tina! Tina's a wee-na! Let's go, ignite, the Wagstaff team is dynamite. (quietly): Now the big finish. Ah! Ah! (lisping): I'm okay. I just bit my tongue. Nailed it! (whoops) Tina, Tina, Tina, Tina, Tina! He's got spirit. I hear it. (screaming) Okay, I'm done. Gene's the Belcher we should get on the squad. Wait, I'm the Yell King here, and I got the guy stuff handled. I mean, is this a cheer squad or a male revue? (laughing nervously) (laughing) Let's chat with Gene. Oh. But Tina was the one that was trying out. (lisping): That's okay, Gene. At least I didn't embarrass myself. I don't even understand her. Gene, what do you say? Are you in or are you in? Mm, I don't know. I've got a lot going on after school. Clearly. I-I'm surprised he even made time for us today. Yeah, you'd have to offer me something pretty sweet to compete with my afternoon bath 'n' snack. Well, there's attention, popularity... Got it, don't need it. Silk cheer shorts. I'm in. Yay, Gene's a cheerleader! The prophecy has been fulfilled! Bob, here come the kids. I'm sure Tina got bad news. Just don't overreact. Why would I overreact? I'm the one who thinks cheerleading is silly. Listen, you can be a little insensitive. Just follow my lead. Tina flew too close to the floor and hit her face on it... swollen tongue. (lisping): It was so much easier in my closet. Oh, my God, sweetie. Aw, your poor tongue. Who cares if you didn't make dumb old cheerleader, right? (bell jingles) You know what? They can... Oh, my God! Gene's a cheerleader! He's a jo... Bob, Gene's a cheerleader! (laughing) So, Mom doesn't seem to care. Oh, God, how'd this crazy, wonderful thing happen to us? Shh. Just take it in. (cackles) I'm a cheerleader mom! Oh, I can't stand it! Um, obviously your-your mom is very proud. Uh, just like she's proud... and sensitive... about all you kids. Right, Lin? What? Oh. Oh, yeah. Oh, Tina. You want to suck on a bag of frozen peas or something? Yeah, that'll help. I'm sorry, I can't understand you. Come here, Gene, oh, Gene! Ooh, let me wear your jacket! Oh, no, it's too small; let me put it on my shoulder. Look at it on my shoulder. Geez, Tina, that looks bad. (lisping): The nurse said the swelling will go down in a couple days. I'm not really getting what you just said. I said the nurse said... Still not getting it. The nurse at school said... Eh... You know what Tina needs? An interpreter! An interpreter? Oh. How about me? I'll do it. I'll be your interpreter. No. I'm hearing "Yes." No. "Yes," we got that. "Yes." No. And she says "Yes." No. And she says "Yes." No. And she says "Yes." Well, looks like you've worked it out. Ambrose: Listen up. We're all here because we wanted this more than anything. Except me... I wanted to advise Drama. But no, Ms. LaBonz got Drama and I got sis-boom-blah! Stop yelling. Anyway, what I am going to do is inject drama into cheerleading, with you as my stars! Hmm? Gene, you're the new kid. The raw rookie. Still breaking in your cheer shorts. Your arch rival is Todd. He is? Yeah, the bitter, boozy old Yell King. And, Todd, you hate Gene. He threatens everything you are! Already there. What about the rest of us? I don't know, let's go around. Who do you hate? Mm, I feel that I hate Jocelyn, because I'm the hot one, and she's the not one. Whatever. Tammy farts when anyone lifts her and it's gross! It's only when someone lifts me wrong. Okay, let's go with the Gene-Todd thing. You'll never be more than the bottom of my pyramid. I'm here... to cheer. Get used to it! Louise: So... as Tina's official interpreter, I'm gonna have my hands pretty full, and that means no homework, unfortunately. I don't know, Louise. Frankly, this sounds like a scheme to miss class. Yeah, I think so, too. What's she saying? Oh, she said she needs me. I didn't say that. And "I have a disability, you insensitive creep." What... "Give me Louise or I will haul your white ass into court!" Okay, okay, okay! Settle down, Tina! Whoa, you're upsetting her. I've never seen her this angry. I... Tell her I'm sorry. She can hear. Oh. I... (exaggerated): Sor... ry. So you like the new you? Twice the spunk, half the junk. (lisping): But you're not really interpreting. Hi, Tina. Hi, Jimmy Jr. You look handsome today. Yeah, she said, uh, "Keep walking, dance man. Take a hint and a breath mint." All right, that is really harsh. Wow. Okay, Tina. Be that way. The claws are out, huh? Good-bye. (laughs) That's it! Louise, you are not my interpreter anymore! You're fired! Um, okay, so, if you're trying to play hard to get, it worked. You want to go out Friday? Okay, you can be my interpreter. (whistle blows) W-A-G-S-T-A-double-F! Wagstaff! Gene, shoulder lift Tammy! (groaning) (Tammy farts) (coughing) Well, don't squeeze, newbie! Don't breathe in, you'll die! That hasn't been proven 100%. Gene, two-man pyramid! Now! (groans) Whalers! Great, Todd, re-hydrate. Come on. Sit. Hwah! Oh, no! That's my funny bone! Which is what I call my pen1s! Eh, you're hurting it! We're number one! Also I have to go number one. Cheer break! Hurry back. Gene, now's your chance to dramatically step in for Todd. I've been pumping him full of sport drink just so he would leave! Oh, my God, oh, my God! I don't know if I'm ready! You're ready! You have a cheer fire inside you and it's burning its way out! Okay. Squad, follow my lead! (chanting): You can do it if you try! Come on, Zeke, pin your guy! He's gonna taste the sweet defeat when he sniffs your feet and seat! Cheer fire! (crowd cheering) Hey, the crowd's getting into it! (groans) I'm getting pinned! Oh, crap, I lost. I hate that! Look at Gene. Look at what he's done. Give me that! What did you do? What did you do? Just pee? That's right. Like a coward with a doodle? He doodled. He doodled! I didn't doodle, he doodled! I wouldn't... Gene, Todd, please! There's a simple and dramatic way to handle this. A head-to-head competition in a public place with high stakes and arbitrary rules. Oh, my God, he's talking about a... Cheer battle! Ah! I knew it, I knew it! Freestyle rules. Last cheerleader standing is the King of the Yells. It could go either way! (whispering): I know who's gonna win. (chanting): Your name is Gene, you've got heart and soul. I even like your haircut, but, hey, where is the bowl? Oh, no, I did that! (cheerleaders ooh) Gene got bowl trolled! Okay, not bad. But here's the deal. (chanting): I mopped up your spit, I rinsed out your towels, and when I hear you cheer, I evacuate my bowels! (laughs) Ooh! Boom! (chanting): Well, you've got no physique, you're kind of round. You make not very good mouth sounds! Huh? Ooh... Hmm. Kind of a thinker. (throws voice): Good job, Todd. That was on the money. Who said that? (chanting): Your rhymes are meh, your logic is flawed. If you're the Yell King, then I'm the Yell God! (all whooping) Oh-ho-ho! I think that was a d*ath blow. I just got chills. No, no, no. Just give me it. Um... (chanting): You think you're smart, but you're stupid. Your cheers are just... flivvity flovity flupid. Ska dee ba doo. That's not cheering, that's scatting. Get out of here, Steven Tyler! (grunts) Ah, I give up! We have a new Yell King! (cheering) Yeah! (quietly): Todd, time to plot your revenge! Ah! Okay, here's your lunch, girls. Oh, Tina, for your lunch, I smoothied a tuna fish sandwich. (lisping): Ugh. That sounds terrible. "Yum! I love you, Mom. Make this every day." Oh, and, Gene, here's your lunch, honey. Peppyroni Pizza, Chicken Pom Pom-adora and a Cheer-liter of soda. That's about 10,000 calories of cheer puns. (Linda whoops) Thanks, Mom. Bye. G! What? I was giving you a "G." You looked like you wanted one. G! Okay. E! N! E! Gene! Oh, my God, Lin. Well, I-I got to be going. Linda: Look, Gene, I can do a herkie. Ow! Uh, sorry. Lin, just let Gene go to school. No, let me do it again. Ow! Bye, Mom! Linda: I can do it better. (grunting) Ow! Oh.   (panting) I love you, my perfect little cheerleader baby! Hey, Tina. (lisping): Hey, Jimmy Jr. Uh, "Hey, idiot." Ugh, I love it when she's mean. So have you thought about where you want to go Friday night? Wherever you want to go. She says, "Pie in the Sky, "the revolving dessert restaurant at the top of the Spinnaker Hotel." She didn't say all that. You're right, I didn't. "Yes, I did say all that." No. Listen, it's not my first choice either, Jimmy Jr. Wait, you're coming, too? Yeah, I have to. It's work. When her lips are flappin', I can't be nappin'. You don't have to go. What'd she say? She said bring a lot of money 'cause we're gonna eat a lot of pie. Oh, man, I guess I could sell my bike. She's worth it! Super toe-touch, Tammy. Great buckets, Jocelyn. You! Nice job with the whatever that is. Todd, pal, how you doing combing out those pom-poms? Still some tangles. Mm-hmm. You're doing a great job with the squad, Gene. Gene is ripe for a fall, and you're the one who can do it, Todd! You mean work really hard on my cheering so that one day, I can... Yeah, that's it, Todd. No, get dirty! So you want me to get dirty? No, that's not what we do here. Get dirty! Yeah, I'm gonna get dirty. You're telling me I lost my wrestling match 'cause of Gene's cheerleading?! He got the crowd on his side, Zeke, not your side. Yeah, the crowd perked up, and next thing you knew, the other guy's nad was in my eye. If only someone could convince Gene to quit the squad. Do what?! Maybe someone who had some muscle. (laughs) Oh, I think I see where you're going with this. Yup, yup. (both laugh) I'm gonna tickle you! I'm gonna tickle you! (high-pitched giggling) Wait, wait, wait. Where are you going with this? (whispering) (gasps) Oh! Hang on, don't fall. What's that? It's a surprise for Gene. I designed a cheer stunt for his squad. He's gonna love it. Uh, Lin, do you think with Gene you're being just a little... suck-uppy? Suck-uppy? I am not a suck up, and I don't play favorites with my kids. I love them all, even the ones who aren't special. Okay, it's just that... Are you wearing a cheerleading skirt? No. It's something I picked up at the thrift store. It's a regular short pleated skirt with stripes on it. In royal blue. With a picture of a Viking. It's comfortable. Go team! Was that a cheer? (laughs): No. Why would I cheer? (sighs) My pep is pooped. All I want to do is eat a huge dinner and go straight to bed and get up later for my 1:00 a.m. cheese plate and then right back to bed. Gene, come look at my cheer stunt! Six cheerleaders sit piggyback on each other in a tower. Mm. And then they all roll at once in a giant cartwheel. Oh, oh. Whoops, whoops. No, don't-don't worry about that. (groans) Look, I made a flip book out of a sticky pad. Whoa! Ah! I call it the Pig Wheel. Get it? (groans) Huh? So you like it? That's a great idea... on planet Crazy Cheer! We'd all die! No, no, look at the flip book. It's crazy, and you're driving me crazy! What? I'm just being part of your cheerleading. You're not a cheerleader, and you never will be! (gasps) Oh, I knew it! You're just like Monica! I hope so because Monica sounds great! I wish I could have cheered with her! (gasps) You! Forget dinner. I'm going to bed! But I'll still be up for the cheese plate! And we better not be out of toast points! (bells jingle) Lin? You okay? (grunts) Gene's not my favorite anymore! I'll go make his cheese plate. (humming) Hell-o. Hello. (screaming) (yelling) (grunting) (whimpering) This is a warning! You quit cheerleading, or I'm coming back for the other nurple! Why?! Why?! Also, this isn't Zeke. This is someone else. And you can't tell who 'cause I'm wearing a jockstrap across my face. Got to go. Got math. Quit the squad! Look at this nurple! It's purple! Well, I didn't do it! Well, someone did! All I know is it wasn't Zeke! So I guess you're quitting. Keep in touch. I'll never quit, or keep in touch! Everyone quiet! I have a dramatic announcement. As a joke, I submitted a tape of this squad to the state cheer association. This morning, I got a call. Is that it? Is that the announcement, or is there...? Oh, shh! I was pausing for effect! You've been selected for Regional Cheer Finals on Kingshead lsland! We made the finals! Oh, my God, finals! I didn't even know about them, but now we're going! Oh, and it's tomorrow, and you need a brand-new, groundbreaking, original routine. Don't look at me. I'm busy! What?! Oh, my God, that's, like, impossible! To win in finals, we'd have to be ahead of our time. Or be from ahead of our time. What? We could be cheer-bots. In robot costumes with robot cheer moves. (robotic voice): Beep bop boop. We will use our laser beam to annihilate your team. Mm-mm, mm. That... is... I can't make up my mind. It's either genius or crap. It's crap. Todd hates it. That means it's genius! Yay, cheer-bots! (excited chatter) Gene: Mom, Dad! Come on, I can't be late! This is the regional finals! All right, keep your shorts on, Short Circuit. Hmm. Lin, come on. Be nice. Sorry, Bob. Still kind of miffed at Gene. Frankly, I'd rather be with Tina on her big date at Pie in the Sky. Poor Louise. She's probably feeling like a third wheel right about now. Louise: Ha-ha, look at me! The world is literally revolving around me! Okay, we have the pie-stravaganza party platter and three forks. Thank you, thank you, and that's my backup fork. (lisping): Can I get some water? She said, "We are barely revolving." Let's turn this lazy Susan into a crazy Susan, okay? Um, it revolves at a speed that's designed for the comfort of our diners, so we can't really... Jimmy, he wants ten bucks. Grease him. (groans): Oh, God, okay. Oh, I'll talk to my pals in the engine room. We want pies flying off the table, buddy. Oh! You feel that? Not really. Oh, yeah! Lovebirds, hold on to your nests! Bob: So, Lin, when cheerleaders compete, who cheers for them? Football players? What? I was... I was making a joke. (gasps) Bob, I don't believe it! What? Hello, Monica. It's Linda. Linda, I... No. No, I'm going first, Monica. You hurt me a long time ago. But you can't hurt me anymore, Missy. I'm so sorry. I don't remember you. Ooh, that hurts. Ooh, that hurts! Oh, it hurts! Oh! Linda from high school. Do you have a child competing here? Yeah, that's my son Gene down there. Oh, my gosh. He looks just like you. Well, he acts just like you. A cold, unfeeling, dead-inside cheer-bot! Oh. So, uh, hey, I'm Bob. Guys, I think we got this thing. Yeah! We go on last, and so far there hasn't been anything half as good as Cheer-Bots from the Year 2525! Announcer: And now, Melvin Laird Middle School presents the robot cheer team from the future! Cheerleaders (chanting): Beep, boop, gleep, glorp! Beep, boop, gleep, glorp! (all screaming) Melvin Laird stole our routine! Those are our semi-erotic robotics, and Melvin Laird stole them! Or someone here leaked it to them! But who would do that? Who would do something like that? Give up? It was me! Wha...?! Why, Mr. Ambrose? Why? Because having your cheers stolen five minutes before you perform is incredibly dramatic! Now you really have to scramble! You are the worst cheer adviser. Louise: Someone burp me. Is that weird? I really need it. (lisping): Louise, let's go already. "Louise, more pie"? I may throw up, but let's roll the dice! No! Stop interpreting! This whole date has been about you, not me! Jimmy Jr., I don't know if you can understand me, but this is the date I wanted. We'd watch a movie... probably 27 Dresses... then we'd walk along the beach at low tide and find a cozy place to sit in the kelp and kiss. I heard every word, Tina. That's the same date I wanted, too. Except that movie... I've seen it three times. So, that's 81 dresses total. Okay, I'm gonna be honest. I can't really understand either of you. (both mumbling) Ow. Oh, now I'm definitely gonna be sick. (retches) (sighs) It's okay. No one's gonna know who did that. Tammy: Guys, guys, guys, huddle up. Maybe it's enough that we're robots from a different year in the future, right? It's not. It's over. There's one thing we can try. It's called The Pig Wheel. It's never been accomplished before except by stick figures. I don't want to be "that guy," but if we do that, we're all gonna die a tragic d*ath in front of our families. Stop, no, I never meant it to come to this! It's too risky! Do it! Do it! The person at the bottom might be crushed. I volunteer. No, Gene. We had our problems, but your passion and charisma are the reason we're even here. You deserve the top. I'll be the bottom. Then I went to college on a cheerleading scholarship. Mm-hmm. I was even was a professional cheerleader for a while. Well, my life turned out great, too! Yeah, I get all the hamburgers I want for free! And French fries! Show her, Bob! Uh, show her what? Well, sometimes you got French fries in your pockets. No, I don't. I d... Oh, wait, there is one. Um, I-I don't know how that got there. Well, I'll eat it. It's pretty cool, huh? Pretty cool! Announcer: Let's hear it for Melvin Laird! That routine definitely computes. Now up, Wagstaff! Hey, what the heck is that? I shouldn't have said I'd be on the bottom. Oh, my God, they're doing my Pig Wheel! I'm a cheerleader! Yay, Gene! You're my favorite again! Mama loves you, baby! Lin, this is crazy. Gene is way up there. There's no way that's safe. (whoops) Okay, everybody, now we're gonna roll in a big wheel. We go on my count. One... two... (farts) That wasn't me! (cheerleaders gasping) Oh, no. They're gonna fall. Gene! I'll catch you! I'll catch you! (all yell) So many knees and elbows! (groaning) Get off! Get off! Get off! Thanks, Mr. Ambrose. That was really, really sweet. Mr. Ambrose, you saved us! Why? Because five minutes ago, I started to really care about you kids. What a twist! The jaded cheer advisor has a heart of gold! Well, we still lost. Todd, if the judges saw what I saw, you're gonna win. So, last place. Mm-hmm. And you got a trophy. You get a trophy for last place? Yeah. At least no one was k*lled, right? Nope. So, that's also good. I don't care if I'm okay. Carry me off! It's more dramatic! (dramatic groaning) Sorry, I said you weren't a cheerleader, Mom. I'm sorry, too, Gene. I was trying to cheerlead through you. And I still am. Here's a new stunt... a pyramid of kids with a kid on top spinning another kid around like a windmill. Go on. I call it The Daffy Dutchman. Stop. Let's give it a sh*t right now. Squad! Mom, walk us through it. No! Ready. Okay. No! Jimmy Jr.: Man. Are we ever gonna get the check? Oh, hey look. Here comes my vomit again. Hi, vomit. Linda (singsongy): We got spirit on our team! That's gr-reat! You got spirit on your team! That's gr-reat! (grunting) (grunting) Fight! © 2014 20TH CENTURY FOX TELEVISION
Come one, come all! Come on in! You! Look at me when I'm talking to you! Don't walk away, you coward! Hello, children. Why aren't you spending what little money your family has at Wonder Wharf today? We're supposed to be handing out these fliers, but no one's biting, so we were about to give them all to our old friend Gary Trashcan. You guys, we could give Mr. Fischoeder a flier. Looks like he's got his hands full with his own struggling business flyers, right, buddy? What? Struggling? The wharf isn't struggling. Ha, ha, ha. It's great! In fact, we're giving the whole park a facelift. And not the kind you give to decrepit old businesses, but the kind you give to hot, sexy, successful businesses. You go girl. Hey, listen, here's three coupons for one ride each. We've reopened the Scream-i-cane... same thrilling ride without any lost limbs. One hopes. Aah! The Scream-i-cane! That's the idea! Yes! Aah! Aah! Both: Aah! We'll take 'em. Bob: Hey, look. I made a flower out of a napkin. Oh, yeah. Look at that. That's great, honey. I know it is. Wow. Not so busy today, huh, Bob? Hello, everyone. Hey, Mr. Fischoeder number two. (laughs) Yeah, you can call me just Felix. I'm gonna call you Lil' Fish.  You're a little fish, Calvin's a big fish  Something smells fishy, la, la, la...  Stop it! I don't like degrading nicknames! Now, if you'll allow me to introduce you to my dirty, flirty, little squeeze thing, Fanny, the 29-year-old girlfriend that I have. I just bought seven bras! Wow. Yeah. Bob, I have a proposition for you. No. You haven't heard it yet. How would you like... I wouldn't. ...to see this run-down old town turn into a thriving now town? No thanks. Wait. Felix, what are you talking about? I am in the midst of negotiations to sell Wonder Wharf and build... high-end condos! It has a ring to it, right? Condos? Condos. Condos? Condos! We talking about condos here? Wait a minute. Sell Wonder Wharf? What does Mr. Fischoeder say about that? He says no, because he's a big dumb wiener! He thinks he can fix that wharf with a few "renovations"? Does putting a Band-Aid on a fart make it go away? That doesn't make sense. Yes, it does. I don't know. Lot of memories on that wharf. I told Bobby I was pregnant with Louise on the Ferris wheel. He just kept screaming. I did. The wharf was where I won my first black light poster. Beginning of a lifelong love affair. The first body I ever worked on washed up under the pier. Little ltalian guy. Strangled. Aw, sweet. You don't get it. What? They don't get it. High-end condos means rich people with money, which they will give to your businesses, so you can become rich. Well, when you put it that way, all right! I love condos! Yeah! Money, money, money. Yeah! Rich, rich, rich, rich, rich, rich, rich. Hurray for money! Well, I don't see how we can help, and I don't want to help, so... Bob, I don't think I've gotten through to you. Take a look at your specials board. (chuckles) Do you think these people appreciate saffron? Appreciate what you're doing here? What is saffron, Bobby? Uh, Mort was asking. I already know. Is it like a food thing, or more of an attitude? What if, on the ground floor of this condo development, there was... (singsongy): an upscale burger place? You could call it "Bob's Bistro on the Beach with the Burgers." Ooh-la-la! Hello bah jour! I could make that happen. Hmm. You've described a secret fantasy of mine. I mean, a nice restaurant, upscale location. I wouldn't name it that, but I'd like to-to... B-Bob, Bob, will you help me with something in the bathroom? What? Um, no. Uh, uh. Felix, I don't want to go, so... And yet, here I am pulling you. Yes, you are. Linda? Bye, Bobby! (both grunting) (people screaming) The Scream-i-cane. We're going on it. Or... hear me out... we don't go on it. Ooh, interesting. I'll go on it, but only if you guys go on the carousel with me after. I want to go visit Mr. Goiter. You never forget your first horse love. (calliope music playing) Fine, we'll go on the Scream-i-cane, then the boring carousel with the freakish horse with a lump on it's neck. Yay! Hey, burger babies! Both: Hey, Mickey. Three of your finest seats, please, Mickey. Gee. Sorry, Louise. You're too short. I can't let you ride. Oh, too bad! Bye-bye. Mickey, Mickey, Mickey, what's a couple inches between friends? Wouldn't be safe, and I also happen to be up for Employee of the Month. We get our pick of the stuffed animals, and I have my eye on a banana wearing Bermuda shorts. What?! Louise, let's just go. Come on. Oh, I hope you're happy with your shorts-wearing banana! Your only friend now, Mickey! Enjoy the park! Don't talk to me! Oh, Felix also bought me these. What? These. Blink, blink, blink. Y-Your eyeballs? The lashes. Oh, they're beautiful. Yeah, they're weasel fur. I knew it. Oh, and when the condos go in, Felix is gonna build me a recording studio. What? Also a nightclub. Oh. 'Cause I have a really good voice, so I'm gonna sing at the nightclub. I love nightclubs and singing! Sing me a song. Okay. She's gonna sing!  Who's that knocking on my door?  Ooh, it's Mister Dance Floor  Everyone is looking fancy  Things are about to get dancey.  Oh, my God, I just almost started dancing! Thank you! Yes, Bob's Burgers on the Beach sounds nice, but I still don't see what you need me for in all this. Also, I wish you weren't peeing right now. Look, Bob. God, I love this bathroom I built for you. I just do. Felix! Okay! I need you for a covert operation. Phase one: you call Calvin with some reason to get him away from the wharf at 1:00 p.m. today so I can take the developers around. Oh, God. I don't like phase one. Phase two: you work on him. Convince him to sell. Me work on him? Why me? He listens to you. Mm. You remind him of our father for some reason. Maybe something about that arm hair. He is always staring at it. Yeah. I understand why. It's exactly our papa's arm hair. That's pretty crazy. I... Hi, Daddy. Um... Too short? I'm not too short. I'm perfect! Hey, I know what this gang needs... a trip to merry-go-round town. (humming) What? "Carousel no longer in service"? "Newer, better, less boring ride coming soon"? Let's take it down, fellas. (Tina yells) Mr. Goiter! Whoa! Merry-go-down, am I right? Too soon. Please, Bob, just keep my brother away from the wharf for a couple of hours, work your arm hair magic on him, and you can have the beachfront restaurant you've always wanted. (sighs): Oh, I don't know. This whole thing doesn't seem completely right. Bob's Bistro on the Beach with the Burgers. I still don't want to name it that. Do we have a deal? (sighs) Okay, deal. (laughs maniacally) But why are you doing that? Oh, I was just thinking of something from earlier today. Well, now I feel weird about this, 'cause you're laughing like that. No, no, no, it's-it's fine. (laughing manically) You're doing it again. All right, come on, let's shake. (chanting): Uh! Mr. Dance Floor! Ooh! Mr. Dance Floor! Wonder Wharf is open for business! (chanting continues) Hey, you... you don't look like you have a job. Come in! Tina: No! You bastards! Whoa. I just got a weird feeling. Well, I didn't wash my hands, so it could be my pee pee. Okay, so you're telling me that Felix gave you a covert mission to keep Mr. Fischoeder away from the wharf for a couple hours... Uh-huh. ...so that Felix can take his developers around, get 'em interested. Uh-huh. And while we've got him, you have to somehow convince Fischoeder to sell Wonder Wharf? Yup. And we get a restaurant on the beach, and we all get rich? Yes. Great. Easy peasy. You think? Yeah. Aw, look at you, humble little burger man deciding the fate of the whole town. I'm not little. Little burger boy wonder. Ooh, I'm gonna make you a T-shirt that says that. I won't wear it. You will. So, a lie to keep Mr. Fischoeder busy for a few hours. Ooh! I got an idea! Mm-hmm. We call him up, tell him we're looking to swing, see if he's into it. Um, no? What? We're cute. Hmm. Oh! What about Take Your Landlord to Lunch Day? We tell him it's Take Your Landlord to Lunch Day? Yeah. Hmm. He does like lunch. He loves lunch. God, I'm hungry. Me, too. Let's eat first. Lady Big Nose, no! Oh! Oh! Mr. Down There Hair! Ooh! Aah! Henry Human Feet! His feet were more human than mine! Boss, I don't know what to do here. Listen, little girl, Mr. Fischoeder wants us to take down the carousel. No one rides it anymore. Possibly because they're put off by the deformed horses. This one makes me a little sick. I don't care about your facelift! Nobody touches Mr. Goiter! He's a hideous delight! Oh. Oh, man! Tina, got an idea! Be right back! Okay. Oh, no! Dr. Big Butt! Take Your Landlord to Lunch Day? Yup. And you want to go to King's Head island? It's your special day. (Fanny humming) Fanny, you want to come to lunch? Mm-kay! Hop in! (humming) Hi. Hi. How are you? Ooh, what'd you get? It's a skirt, but I'm gonna wear it as a dress so you can see my butt. Butt-dress. I like it! Butt-dress, butt-dress golly. (laughs) (whispering loudly): Psst. Fanny, want to hear a secret? We're doing the plan. Hmm? Bob: Lin? Felix is planning to get Fischoeder away from the wharf. Bob: Lin? Linda: He doesn't have any idea. He doesn't have a clue. Linda, we can hear you. What? No. It's girl talk. (whispering loudly): They can't understand us. Oh, my God. Bob? Yes? There is no Take Your Landlord to Lunch Day, is there? Oh, maybe they can understand us. Little bit. Damn. I was really excited about it. Landlords never get any fun stuff. Linda: Aw. I just got a refill. What'd I miss? Well, the workers went on break, so I'm just taking a little breather. They're not on break. They're right there. What?! You said you were gonna sit with your lunch boxes and chitchat! We ran out of stuff to talk about. Well, I... How about, um, like, what you did this weekend? Sorry, kid, but we got to do this. (sighs) Fine. Just, let me say good-bye. Okay.  Good-bye, Mr. Goiter  I love you so much  Nice bike lock. It's Teddy's. He was hoping it'd inspire him to get a bike. Tina. What? Put your head right there. Okay. Hey! Oh. I wish I could have gotten in a more comfortable position. Now swallow the key. What is going on?! And that's how you lock your sister to a wooden horse! Yeah! Um, unrelated... does anyone have any water or some pudding? So, as you can see, incredible ocean views, and a girl bike-locked to the carousel. What? I didn't say that. Okay, snow cones on me. Go pick out your flavors, go crazy. I'll be right back. Hi, how you doing? Greetings. Um, what are you doing? I've bike-locked myself to Mr. Goiter to save him. Yeah. Leave now, or I will make you leave. Oh, do you have the ability to make 13-year-old girls poop out keys? He might! Don't look in his eyes! This guy's trying to make my sister poop! (laughs): No, I am not! Girl-pooper! Girl-pooper! Girl-pooper! Shut up! This is boarding school all over again! Boarding school sounds fun. Fischoeder: So, Felix put you up to this, huh? Kidnapping me so he can show his developers around my wharf parts? No. Yes. Well, I want to go shopping. I want some new stuff. What? You can't just leave a kidnapping to go shopping. This isn't Florida. Both: Bye! (humming) Shop! Yeah. (sighs) So, you're probably mad. Not really. Doesn't matter. I'm not going to sell, anyway, ever. So, we might as well eat. Right? Uh, yeah. Oh, my God. I... forgot my wallet. Ah! Imagine. Uh, you could cover and I'll get you back. You want to do that? Of course. Why wouldn't I pay for my own kidnapping lunch? (quietly): All right. Bob's Bistro on the Beach. Bob's Bistro on the Beach. Here we go. Mr. Fischoeder, I know you said you weren't gonna sell ever, but if you did sell the wharf, you could... I told you, Bob, it's off the table. Now, uh, what to talk about. What do you think of... loose women? (music playing) I like them. Mm-hmm. Mr. Fischoeder.  I know you're already a wealthy-ish guy  But think of what that condo money could buy  And I'd open up Bob's Beach Burgers and Fries  Oh, nice things are nice  Uh-uh. Not interested.  Your own private island  A million eye patches  No, I don't think so  A gold swimming pool  I to hold all of your cashes  No, sorry, Bob  I'd hire real waiters who all have mustaches  No, no, no, no, no, no, no  Oh, nice things are nice  Soon you will see just how nice life can be  When you start raking in condo people's money  Ooh, I love this dress, does it come  In size three?    Uh-uh. Okay, six? Uh-uh. Okay, ten?  Oh, nice things are nice  I'm chained to Mr. Goiter  La, la, la, la, la, la...  In hopes that they don't destroy her  Okay, it's not a her, but I really  Really wanted it to rhyme  A legion of servants, all at your command  An army of tigers, like you always planned  I could buy my own missiles to launch at Engl...  Never mind, I'm not telling.  My sophisticated burgers they would understand  (harmonizing):  Oh, nice things are nice...  You guys. Excuse me. There's no singing in here. Oh, sorry. Thank you. Sorry. Sorry. Terribly sorry. Yeah. Thank you. Got carried away. Linda: So... did you guys have fun? Uh, yeah. We, uh, shared a moment. I think. Or maybe not. I don't know. This is a disaster. Bob? Yeah? I don't know what it is about you, you bushy-armed b*st*rd. Um... But you've convinced me to sell Wonder Wharf. Really? That-That's great. Hooray! Hooray! All right! Have you ever tried brushing it this way? Like this? No, uh, but I will. It's a good look for you. Calvin, where have you been? What have I been doing? Just, you know, had myself kind of a chill-out day. You know, made a collage, skipped a rock. Felix, listen. You can tell your developers that I'll sell. (exclaims) Yah mo be there! Let's start calling the lawyers! What's going on over at the wharf? Oh, nothing, nothing. Lot of people. Are those news trucks? Hey. Don't worry about that. Look at me. Check this out. Here we go. Go down, and then my arms go back and forth, I lift my leg up and... Why have you locked yourself to this horse, young lady? Well, um, he has a name; it's Mr. Goiter. Oh, there's my dad. Dad! They want to destroy the carousel. You have to help me stop them. Tina! Aw, you look so pretty for the news. Tina, I know you love the carousel, but I have to tell you something. (quietly): They're tearing down Wonder Wharf to build condos. (crowd gasps) No...! Uh, you weren't supposed to hear that. It's for the best. You understand, right, honey? Damn you all to hell! Yup, so... great. They're tearing down Wonder Wharf? What if I grow? What rides am I gonna ride on now?! Why even grow?! And what do I do with 10,000 skee-ball tickets?! I've been saving up for the Pontiac Solstice! Mr. Fischoeder, is this true? Are you selling the Wharf? Uh, yes, it's, uh... Uh, Calvin, Calvin. Can I take this one? Hi, I'm Felix Fischoeder. The other odor. (chuckles) Listen, folks, once those wealthy condo owners start patronizing your businesses, your disappointing, fruitless lives will be full of fruit, because you will be rich enough to buy fruit. Yeah. Sweet condo-people money. That's right! That's right! That's right! That's right! Let's get their money! All right. Hey, I know you got a lot going on here, but, uh, here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna cut out this pole, pull you off with a forklift, and... hopefully, it's safe. What? Linda: What's happening? What's going on? What is happening? What is happening?! Tina! Uh... Well, at least Mr. Goiter's okay. (screams) Tina, my precious baby angel! Tina, are you all right? No, I'm not! First Mr. Fischoeder wants to tear down the carousel, now you want to tear down the whole wharf? This place means a lot to a lot of people. What's wrong with you?! Okay, honey, you're hysterical. It's all right. Come here. (grunts) Mama's gonna hug you back to normal. Come on. This park is like... like the heart of the town. Shu-shush, shush, shush, shush. Shu-shush, shush, shush, shush. Oh, my God. You're right. Tina's right. I was gonna say all that stuff! You were? No, but you guys are getting so clique-ish! So you convinced Mr. Fischoeder to sell? Yes. To build condos? As in condominiums? Yes. Dad, I love you, but what the hell were you thinking, you idiot? Sorry, I love you. Oh, God, I-I got to go talk to him. No! The condos! The money! Hey, I got an idea, let's go get pretzels. Lin, I-I knew Felix was wrong, but I let myself get talked into it. I got to go fix this. Just be rational! Linda. Linda, let go. (growls) Linda, stop it. You're hurting me! Mom, let him go. Let him go, Mom! Drag her off me! Don't do it! No, you let him go! Don't you do it! Get her off! (all grunting) Nuts. Now, these condo people... what percentage of their income would you say they spend on yarn? Oh, what a good question. Roughly 45%. That's not very high! Hey, Mr. Fischoeder, could I speak to you for a minute? In private? Yes. Please. These people keep talking to me. Uh, how about we go on a ride? Hey, I heard good things about the Scream-i-cane. Okay, what the hell. Come on, Gene. We're going, too. I told you, no roller coasters! The technology just isn't there yet! Now here's a question for you. Who likes nightclubs with a Caribbean theme and a 29-year-old singer who happens to be my girlfriend? (giggles) It's me. Hey, Mr. Fischoeder. You're looking rich today, sir. Hey, we're with the boss man, Mickey, so lay off! Yup, safety second, that's what I always say. Stop us! Stop us! You're terrible at your job! We appreciate your feedback. I'm gonna die and I never got to see Hall & Oates live! So, you can't sell the wharf. Really? Yes. Great. Hey, I have some laundry here. Maybe I'll just throw it into you, big fat washing machine man. What? 'Cause you're wishy-washy! You just convinced me to sell the wharf. Look, Mr. Fischoeder, I was wrong. I got greedy. (all screaming) Bob: I don't feel good! Fischoeder: Good! Louise: Yeah! I got caught up in having this nice place on the beach, selling burgers to... Oh, God... fancy rich people. Aah! Why did I think this would be a good place to talk?! 'Cause you're an idiot! Hmm. It always seems to get stuck here on the big hill. And then the limbs come off. Oh, God. Louise, is it over? Am I home on the couch watching The Closer yet? Yup. Aah! This episode takes place on the Scream-i-cane! Wow. It's beautiful. Are you going to try to kiss me? What? Well, you used to be straight, but who knows with Mr. Flippy Floppy? Mr. Fischoeder, listen. I thought I wanted nice things, but I don't even like nice things. I mean, look at this shirt. This is my favorite shirt. Ooh. That is so sad. Look, those condos would make us like everywhere else. The wharf is the heart of the town. It's what makes this place special. I mean, sure, it's run down, it-it's really seedy, it's kind of dirty, they don't pick up the garbage. Mm. But it's also great. Hmm. So, are they gonna chopper us out of here or... (all screaming) (Louise whoops) Oh, God, off. Yes, off. We did it! I lived. I knew that rules didn't apply to me. I knew it! Whew! My pants are moist but not wet. Oh, that part's wet. Boy, it's been a long time since I've been on a ride; they're wonderful. (laughs) Papa always said people like things that go up and down and side to side and jiggle all their stuff around. And mother sewed that on a pillow. That's nice. I'm never selling Wonder Wharf. What? Never! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you saying?! I'm not ever selling this wharf! What?! No, no, no, no, no! Damn it! Linda! Wha...? I'm going on again. Me, too! And here I come, too. Clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop. Felix, what about my nightclub? Fanny, Fanny, Fanny, Fanny, Fanny, Fanny, Fanny... No! You're not getting any of this. Or this. What? Or even this. (screams) Thanks for saving the town, Dad. You're welcome, Tina. Thanks for reminding me what's important. Yeah, sure. Hey have you ever pooped out a key? No. Um... dice. Mm. Well, okay, I'll figure it out. So, we really did it, huh? Well, I did it. You almost blew it. Yeah, but then I brought it all home, kind of heroically... not to pat myself on the back, but... Felix. There you are. Uh, sorry. I, uh... I realized what you were trying to do was horribly wrong and... is that a g*n? Yup. It sure is. It's where I keep my bullets. (nervous laugh) Okay, well, I'm going to, uh, head out. No, no! No, no, no. (laughs maniacally) Oh, he's doing that laugh. I don't like that. No. Are you thinking of something funny from earlier today? No! I'm laughing maniacally! Okey dokey. Glad you like this rotten old wharf so much, 'cause it's where they're going to find your rotten old bodies. Hey, hey. I-I don't think you have a rotten old body. Um, I think he's talking to both of us, right? No, no, no. Can't be. You're the old one. Look at your face. What? Shut up! You're both old and you're both gonna die! Oh, so you did mean both of us. Yeah. (gunshot) Quiet, please! Linda:  Wonder Wharf  Wharf of wonder  This won't end  Till Bob's six feet under  He wanted things that were nice  But will he pay the ultimate price?  Wonder Wharf  © 2014 20TH CENTURY FOX TELEVISION
I am in the midst of negotiations to sell Wonder Wharf and build... high-end condos. What does Mr. Fischoeder say about that? (yelling) You work on him, convince him to sell. (singing carnival tune) "Carousel no longer in service"? "Newer, better, less boring ride coming soon"?  I know you're already a wealthy-ish guy  But think of what that condo money could buy  And I'd open up Bob's Beach Burgers and Fries...  That's how you lock your sister to a wooden horse. Yeah. I'm not ever selling this wharf! What?! Hey, have you ever pooped out a key? No. Um... dice. Glad you like this rotten old wharf so much, 'cause it's where they're going to find your rotten old bodies! Bob: Oh, God. This is bad. Ow! These ropes are tight. This is really bad. There's no point in making us uncomfortable before you k*ll us, Felix. What happened to common courtesy? Stop talking! Keep being scared. Oh, just sh**t us already, for God's sake. The suspense is boring me. What?! No! Don't. What are you doing? I'm calling his bluff, Bob. Come on, pull the trigger, you big baby. I'm not a baby! I'm a big boy! A big, dangerous boy! Baby. Stop it! Baby. Stop it! Come on, baby! Stop teasing him! I can't help it. He's incapable of doing anything right on his own. Stop saying that! I'm sick of it! Calvin... (grunts) Calvin, I've lived too long in your stupid, weird shadow to just sh**t you. You're going to die slowly, tied to the pier you love so much. I-I don't love it. You see that way up there above your head? That's the high-tide line. That's where the water's gonna be in just a little while. I see. You'll watch the tide come in before you drown, which will give you time to think about how all this could have been avoided if you'd just stayed on track and sold the friggin' wharf with me! Oh, God. Now I have to k*ll you and inherit your stupid voting share and do what you wouldn't do. You'll just be some dead guy getting eaten by crabs, and I'll be Mr. Fischoeder! Me, not you! You'll be Calvin... Crabs, the stupidest dead person in the world. Well said! Well, I-I just want to say, you are already the important Fischoeder to me, Felix. I've always felt... Bob. Bob, Bob, Bob, I see what you're doing. I see what you're going for here, but I'm mad at you, too. Plus, you got to k*ll the witness. Everyone knows that. That is true. Don't agree with him! Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get up there and start living my new amazing life as Felix Fischoeder, the condo king with a dark secret and a girlfriend! Okay. Oh, God. Please, Mr. Fischoeder, do something. I have kids! Oh, come on, Bob. Those kids aren't that great. Felix, come back! I will... later. I'll see you when you're dead! Buh-bye! Help! Well, thanks to your father, we aren't getting any new condos in this dumb town. No new money and no Bob's Burgers on the Beach. Nope. Just back to our boring, crappy lives in this stinky, poopy, rundown, shanty town by the sea. Where is Dad anyway? I haven't seen him for, like, 45 minutes. Do you think he has a separate Dad pad? Maybe he's back at the restaurant. That's where I always picture him. (door bells tinkle) Hmm, no Bob. Well, I guess we'll open up for dinner without him. Maybe he's out partying with Mr. Fischoeder, his new buddy. Big boys night out, I guess. (scoffs) We can have a girls night in. I have a great new nail polish I've been dying to try. It's called "clear." Sure, if you want to look like a prostitute. Fanny, there's my silly skunk! No! Get away from me! Get off! Sweetie, I know you're upset, but listen. I took care of everything. The condos are back on, all right? So, I will just put my arm around you thusly. Uh-uh! Fanny! I just said... (clears throat) I took care of everything. So, I'm getting my recording studio and my nightclub? Yes! Damn it! I took care of it! Don't yell at me. Sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm... Oh, God. You know, I'm having a stressful day. Don't care. Hey, let's, uh, walk around and see where that nightclub will be. Okay. How about over there? No! Okay. How about... uh, you like that location? Mm... mm-mm. Right. Let's... look to our left now. I don't like any of 'em. (evil laughter plays on recording) (grunting) Quit squirming around, Bob. Do you have worms? (grunts) 'Cause I do, and you're making them crazy. I'm trying to get my phone out of my back pocket. I can't reach it. Mr. Fischoeder, you need to get it for me. Oh. All right. Ooh. Ooh! That's unfortunate. What is? Your butt. Oh. Sorry? Up here, you're okay, but down here, it gets bad. Okay, just pull the phone out. Okay. Flip it open! Really? You have a flip phone? Yes. It works fine to make calls, and that's what phones are for. Nonsense, Bob. Phones are for playing tiny games about fruit on. Just hit the call button, Mr. Fischoeder. It'll dial Linda since I called her last. Ah! (phone ringing) Hello? She answered! Linda! Linda! Hello, Linda! Bob? I can't hear you, hon. Bob (shouting): Linda! It's loud. I think he's at a bar. I'm gonna k*ll him. (evil recorded laughter) Oh, what's that laughing? What is...? Bob?! Linda, listen! Felix tied us up under the pier! Call the police! I think he butt-dialed you. Yup, that's his butt's voice. Dad, it's Tina. Are you at a party? Are there boys there? Bob, you're wasting all our minutes, so you better be out buying more minutes! Bye! (phone ringing) I still can't hear you! He's pocket-dialing me again. Lin, don't hang up! No, no, no, no. Ugh! Try her again. Bob, I think we're coming off a little desperate. We are desperate! (phone ringing) Bob, I'm putting your butt on "silent," for once. Who wants ice cream? No! No, no! Ooh, that's chilly. That 911 operator did not like us, Bob. No one can hear us. They thought we were prank calling. Maybe we could text 911. Can that sad little thing text? Sort of. Oh, we could text Linda! It'll be hard, but let's try it. Yeah, it's hard. I can't really see what I'm typing. I'm just pressing on the phone. Wow, the tide is coming in fast. It's the same speed it always comes in. Don't blame this on the ocean, Bob. Hey, what are you looking at? My boobs are up here. Oh, sorry, babe. I... There they are... Milo and Otis. No, that one's Milo, that one's Otis.  Ding-dong, diddly, ding-dong, dong!  (phone buzzing) Mom, you got a text! You're blowing up! What's your secret? Maybe it's Jimmy Jr. texting you to ask you what I'm doing for the rest of my life. He's gonna be pretty disappointed when he finds out. It's from your dad. "Help. I'm tired yo." What?! Of course he's tired. He's so old. Your father doesn't say "yo." The only time he ever said "yo" was when he went to Tina's class for career day. Maybe that's not what he meant to type. Maybe it's autocorrected. Oh, yeah. Like that time I texted mom that I was super horny when I was really super hungry. Why would I be horny? I'm not an antelope. I wonder what his text was supposed to be. What if it was something that would make us all LOL? Well, let's figure it out. Should be easy. Dad doesn't know that many words. (grunting) We got to get that phone. I'll try to get it with my foot. Oh, look at those nimble, hairy little toe-men go. (grunting) (beep, click) What the hell was that? I think I took a picture, and I think I sent it. I hope you got my best side. I'm talking about my wiener bulge. Stop. Tina, are you wearing my bike lock as a necklace? Kind of? Well, it's very flattering. It makes your head look... safe. Now he sent me a weird picture. Okay, you know, I'm starting to get a little worried about him. Let me see that. Just looks like a white blob to me. Look who's talking. Oh... that's Mr. Fischoeder's butt. How do you know what Mr. Fischoeder's butt looks like? I have a photographic butt memory. Oh, yeah. Wait a minute. What's that thing? Could be a rope or maybe a breadstick? Ah, they stole my idea for breadstick ropes. I think I got it. I'm getting it up your leg. Grab it. Grab it. Oh, but it's all footy. Grab it! If it drops in the water, it's over! Fine. Louise: Okay, the autocorrect suggestions for "tired" and "yo" are up there. Now we match 'em up and see what makes sense. Maybe he meant, "I cried, y'all." Why is he now Southern?! Could it be... "I tried blow"? We were gonna do that together. Just once. (gasps) Oh, my God! Teddy was right! I knew it! Wait... about what? About the picture, the rope. "Tired yo" is... "Tied up"! Dad's tied up somewhere! (all gasping) He's in a meeting! And he's going to be there for a while. I hope this is working. I tried to write, "Felix has us under the pier." I'm not sure if I got it all, but it should be close. Hit "send." Are you sure, Bob? Are you going to yell at me again? Just hit "send." Okay. Oh, no! Oh, no! Aha! Well, who gets to yell at whom now? Oh, my God. Did you hit "send"? Well, I hit something. Let's talk about something else. I spy with my little eye one large cloud shaped like a camel. Right there. Where? That one. That one, yes. Aah! Aah! Aah! Oh, my God, who's got my Bobby tied up? Let's think. Who are Dad's enemies? Time, gravity, toothpaste... Jimmy Pesto. Louise: Eh, Jimmy's got an alibi, which is, he is dumb. (phone buzzing) It's from Dad! It says, "Fix got under seven seven," then a shrimp emoji, and the word "Pierre." Oh, God! Someone named Pierre's got him tied up, and he's force-feeding him shrimp. (gasping, groaning) Okay, everyone, stand back! Help! Help! You have to pull yourself together! (grunts) You have two children and a Louise to take care of! Okay, okay. Stop slapping me. Oh, no, wait... one more. (grunts) Wait a second. Guys, there's a restaurant a few blocks away, called Pierre's, and they serve shrimp and breadsticks. Breadsticks! They're all right. They're not great. Quick, Mom. Let's close the restaurant forever and go find Dad! Hang on, Dad. Here we come. And hang on, shrimp. Here comes Gene. Well, look at the bright side. With the water this high, we can finally go to the bathroom without being embarrassed. Oh, that's warm. Yeah. You doing that? I'm doing it. Okay, so, I'll do the talking. No, I'll do the talking, you do the roughing up. And I'll eat the shrimp. And I'll watch Gene eat the shrimp. And I'll look around for clues. But if any of those clues are shrimp, bag 'em and give 'em to me. Hello. Welcome to Pierre's. Table for... what do we have, five? (laughing): Yeah. We're not here to eat. We're looking for this guy. His name's Bob, and you kidnapped him! Let me at him! Give me back my son! I don't have your... What are you...? Please! All right, let me look at the toilet picture again. You got a lot of nerve, buddy. Ow! Ah, can't breathe. (Teddy grunting) Seeing... spots. (man groaning, Teddy grunting) Don't want to... die. Wow, that guy really fainted. And barfed. I feel bad. He got really upset there. All we're trying to do is just talk to him. But he still gave me shrimp. And he said come back anytime. What a class act. Uh, well, what do we do now? Bosco: Yep. Uh-huh. What is it? What is it? I think I know where Bob is. Where?! He took the chug boat out to Alcohol lsland. These are drunk texts. I know 'em when I see 'em. Oh... Look, here are 87 texts I sent to my ex-wife last night. What do you think I meant by: "I'm sorry I'm not sorry"? Well, Bosco was no help. We got to face facts. No one cares about Dad except us. And, really, it's just Mom. And me. And Tina. Time to split up and search. If we want to find him, we're gonna have to track him down ourselves. Does anyone have anything of his we can smell? I have his jeans. We all have his genes. No, I have his jeans. I cut them into shorts. Oh, come on, like you're not all wearing a pair of Dad's cutoff jeans under your clothes! Fischoeder: Wow, wow, wow. I didn't think he'd go through with it. Where's your family, Bob? Why aren't they looking for us? I don't know. Maybe they didn't get our texts. Well, things are bad, Bob. Things are very bad.  I never thought this is how I would go  Ooh...  Here under the pier tied to Mr. Fischoe  Der, but looks like Linda will be a widow  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  Oh, bad things are bad  I fear that my Bob's in a terrible place  Maybe you'll find him inside  Of this vase  Maybe a lion is eating his face  Oh, bad things are bad  Maybe your Dad was tied up by a sailor    (wheezy):  I'll help you look  After I pump this inhaler  Check out my pants, they are perfectly tailored  Oh, yeah. Nice. Thanks.  Oh, bad things are bad  Oh, I wish that Bob would come back  I could really use a big snack  Okay, it's not a burger but I'll just pretend it is  And maybe cry...  (sobbing)  I did what I had to, I have no regrets  I m*rder*d my brother for power and s*x  What's this weird feeling inside of my chest?  Why do you keep not looking at my breasts?  Oh, bad things are bad  Farewell, cruel world, looks like I'll die alone  If only you'd purchased a better cell phone  And now I'll never know who wins Game of Thrones  Oh  Things are bad!  (both coughing) (panting, groans) Louise: At first it was kind of funny that Dad was missing, but now I don't like it. We could end up with just Mom. No offense, Mom. No, no, we need your dad. You kids are a two-adult, two-bottle-of-wine-a-night job. Ugh! Where the hell is he? He didn't just disappear. Oh, hey, look. There's Felix. We got to warn him his brother's in danger! Felix! Felix! Linda! What are you doing here? We got these weird texts from Bob. We think he's with your brother. You see? My-my daughter says that's probably his butt. Definitely. Definitely his butt. Look, okay?! What? I mean, look, I'm trying to be super friendly here, Linda, but... I don't know where he is, okay? (clears throat) Linda, Linda, Linda. Bob and my brother are probably just, right at this moment, terrified... What? gasping for... What? Gasping for what? Cheese? You are sweating a lot, Felix. You are moist. You don't know how moist I usually am. You feeling okay? Uh... ooh... ah... oh... oh... Well, Felix seems fine. oh... uh... Calvin! What have I done? (evil recorded laughter plays) (gasps) I recognize that sound. (evil laughter continues) From the phone call. He's here! Bob's right here somewhere. Hey, where'd Felix go? Why is Felix going down under the pier? I need him to pay for this hot dog. Do you have any money? How about you? Little one. How 'bout you, glasses? No? (groans) The pier? (gasps) Pierre is pier. Bob's under the pier! Oh, my God! Uh, we need three pedal boats... and hurry! Well, if you want a fast boat, you really want the turtle. I know it's counterintuitive... Just get in! Now, you need to wear a life vest... Move it, chump! Enjoy your time on the water. It's beautiful. Dad, if you're dying, don't! It's not your time, Dad! I want to put you in a nursing home next year! You've got to teach me to shave! Everywhere! (gagging) Bob: Hey! someone's coming! Over here! Over here... (gagging) Fischoeder: It's Felix! I knew it! Oh, no. No, no, no. No. I knew he didn't have the ball... (gagging) What do you want now, Felix? I'm here to save you! Oh. Hurry up then! Untie us! Right, so, just going to, uh... sh**t into the water to undo the ropes. No! No, no, no. That's a bad plan, Felix! Bad plan! Felix: Mm... He's too chicken to jump in. (clucking) (laughing) Oh, my God, could you stop taunting your brother? Yeah, and I'm not chicken! I'm... It's just the water's, uh, choppy. Linda: Bobby! Linda! Dad! Everyone quiet! I'm preparing to jump in and save them... just, uh, need to mentally get ready here. Oh, come on! Someone, please hurry! Felix, what the hell is going on? I was gonna k*ll my brother so I could sell the wharf and get you your nightclub, but I-I can't do it. What?! I'm going in. Uh-uh, Felix. Nobody move! What? (gasps) Fanny, what are you doing? I won't let you ruin my dream. This is my time! All of my life, people have been telling me what I can't do. "Fanny, you can't show your butt." "Fanny, you can't sh**t people." Today I'm gonna do both! Bob: Oh, God. (gagging) Shut up! I can't think. What else is new? Okay, Linda, you and the kids get off your boats, get in the water and then drown. Can't we just do the first part and splash around and have fun? Oh, come on, Fanny, I'm your gal pal. Shopping? Right? (chuckles nervously) No! Out! (grunts) Kids, grab onto me. Use me to float. Fanny, don't do this. Shut up, Felix! Just sit there and inherit his money. Okay, everyone start drowning... now! (grunting, gurgling) Glug, glug! Ach! You guys are so bad at drowning. I guess I'm gonna have to sh**t you! Oh, God. I'm sorry I got us into this. Kids, I love you. And, Linda, I love you, too. Almost as much as the kids, but not... Oh, Bobby... I love you, too. I'm sorry I was mad at you about the stupid condos. I love you, Mom! And you, Dad! I love you all. But that's just between us. I love everyone! I love you, Mom. Oh, I love you too, honey. What-what are they all doing? I have no idea. I love you guys! Gene: I love you, Dad! Oh, God, they're starting again. Tina: I love you, Mom. Okay, listen up! I'm gonna sh**t you first. One... Bobby, no! two... Fanny, wait! What?! Uh, uh, before I die, um, could you... I would really like to hear one of your songs. Really? Oh, my God. So sweet. Which one? Uh, the one about the dancing? And it's really loud? "Dancing So Loud"? Yes! Well, that one's not really finished yet. I'll sing "Mr. Dance Floor." It's hot. Oh, good, good.  Who's that knocking on my door?  Ooh, it's Mr. Dance Floor...  (quietly): Linda, the piling. What? The piling near Fanny, Lin. Ram that boat shaped like a turtle into it. Oh. Got it. Got it.  Everybody's looking fancy  Things are about to get dancey...  Show's over, Fanny! Hmm? (creaking) (Felix and Fanny shouting) Quick! Someone untie us! I'm coming for you, Bobby! I'm not that great at knots, but I'll try. (grunts) Uh... Uh... Uh... (gasps) Oh, thank God. Yay, Mom. Hmm? (shouting) Bob: Oh, God, swim away! Swim away! Linda: Everyone dive! Dive! (gasps) Tina! Thank God, you beautiful four-eyed son of a b1tch. (gasps) Mom! There's my girls. Where's Gene? I'm over here. Just doin' my own thing. I'm fine, I'm fine. Who cares? (groans) Where's my Bobby? Ah! You saved us, Linda. Thank God we live in a time where women can learn to swim. A burial at sea... it's what the carousel would've wanted. We talked about it a lot toward the end. (gasps) My little Fanny-apple! Uh-uh, my hair's wet! Gene: Where are they going? They're swim-running away! (gasps) They're escaping to Mexico! Or whatever's across the water. What's over there? (helicopter whirring) (whining) Bob: So I guess they'll arrest Felix, too. No. I told them Fanny was responsible for everything. What?! Look at him, Bob. We can't send him to jail. He'd hate it there. He tried to k*ll us. Not really. We were just, uh, wrestling. Like brothers. Wrestling? Tussling? Bonding. I don't know. Oh, my God. Besides, he came back for us. I told you he'd never go through with it. I'm gonna tell them. Hey, how 'bout $4,000? Would that make you feel better? What?! You can't put a price on my family. Seven? Three. Tina: Two. Louise: One. Blastoff! Guys, will you give me a minute here? Great! We'll just forget the whole thing. I didn't say... What a crazy day! God, I had cereal in the morning, and by nighttime I'm getting m*rder*d. Lin, I'm trying to work out some money thing here with Mr. Fischoeder, so... Uh-uh. You need a warm shower and a hot meal, mister. Felix, I get one free punch. Come here. You know the rules. Bob, I'm glad we found you. I'm glad, too, Lin. The Belchers are a land family. We should be together in a restaurant, not under some dumb wharf. Let's go home. It's not dumb. That's the wharf we saved; That Dad saved. And look how it thanks us. Well, it sort of saved us. We get it, Dad... you love the wharf. (sighs) I don't even want to look at it. Ooh, I'm gonna have a bottle of wine and eat some croutons in bed. Tina: Yay, crouton party in Mom and Dad's bed. Bob: No. Louise: Yes! Bob: Oh, my God. © 2014 20TH CENTURY FOX TELEVISION
(indistinct arguing) Doug: Your son ruined everything! Linda: My son is a star! (talking over each other) Calm down, Linda, calm down. He's the future Neil Patrick Harris! What? Neil Patrick Harris is way more talented than Gene. Frond: Quiet down, everyone! Thank you. Now, there's a lot of parents and children waiting out there that came to see the fall musical, but it seems that we have some conflict going on here. Luckily, conflict has one enemy: Me. So I'm going to get out my peace pad and we are going to process this mess and put it to rest. Now, who wants to tell me what happened? I'll tell it! Well, hey, why does he get to tell it? Because he's my beautiful boy, that's why. Yeah, and you're just someone's dad. Yeah, my dad. People, please! Gene... It started with the school announcements... MS. LABONZ (over P.A.): Attention Wagstaff student body. The fall musical is coming up, and we're not doing Grease again. I can't! I'm not doing it! For this year, we will be accepting student submissions for an original production. (gasps) So, if there's anyone out there who's creative... Me. Talented... Me! And musically brilliant... Me! ...this is your big chance. Also, today's lunch is tacos. Tacos?! This is the best day of my life! Shirt rip! (grunting) You guys! This is it! I can finally unleash my passion project on the world! Are you talking about... Die Hard, the Musical! You've been working on that one for a while. Yeah, ever since I saw Die Hard and said, why is no one singing? Why is no one dancing? What's wrong with Hollywood? Uh-oh. Who's got a necklace in her mouth, is smothering, and like-likes you? Mom? Louise: No, Courtney. Oh, no. Hey, Gene. Ooh... Okay, she wants you back. I'll handle this. Look, Courtney, I know you want to get with this. Okay? But honey... It's a mess. I mean, what are we even looking at here? Uh, no, I don't want to get back together. This is about the musical. I bet you're doing the Die Hard One, right? He let me read it when we were dating. That's it, Courtney. Just remember the good times. Anyway, I'd love to be in it. And I've been taking a hip-hop dance class... (muttering): I my am Courtney I am... I like to give... and I go to the... I... ho ho, and this... the ho ho, and now I'm done. (breathing hard): So, yeah. First of all, I love it. Second of all, no. Only because I want my play to be good. I totally get it. That dance was horrible, and I'm really annoying. Anyway, bye! What? I didn't say that. But I think I captured the spirit of your words. I am not annoying. Well... Yeah, you are. Yeah, it's bad. Well, I remember it this way. May I be in your Die Hard musical, please? No! I like tacos! (farts) Yeah, that sounds like Gene. Yep. Anyway, along came the day we were all supposed to submit our plays... So what's your fall musical about? Leaves. (blows note)  Red, yellow, orange and brown  They're on the tree then they fall down.  Good... (piano playing) Wait, who's in there now?  I've got the passion of a woman  Looking for her start  And the only thing bigger than my hair  (off-key):  Is my heart! And that's just one of the amazing songs from Working Girl, the Musical! Courtney! You stole my thunder! No, I didn't. So it's just a coincidence you took a beloved movie from the 1980s... some say the sassy sister film to Die Hard... and set it to music and lyrics? Thunder thief! I'm sorry, but that keyboard is adorable. Did you rescue it from a shelter? Nice one, Daddy. Well, where'd you get your keyboard, Doug, the Too-Big Keyboard Store? Enough keyboard insults. Gene, it'll be your turn in a minute and we can hear what you've got. You'll hear what I've got, all right. Because it is very audible! (chanting): Nakatomi, Nakatomi, Nakatomi, Nakatomi, Nakatomi, Nakatomi, Nakatomi... Okay, I'm gonna stop you there. But I haven't even... It's fine, don't worry. Thank you. Peter, you can come in now. Ready to catch my fall musical? It's fall, y'all! Ms. LaBonz, did I mention that I know Carly Simon, the artist behind the Working Girl and "Let the River Run," and if we do our play, she'll come to the show? We're doing Working Girl! Yeah! All right! Aah! Oh. Oh, my poor baby! My baby. Lin, not so hard. Can we please stay focused here? We absolutely can, Mr. Frond. Let me take over. You see, being the generous soul that I am, I had to step in and help a brother out. Louise, why are we in the boiler room? I want to just go home and crawl into bed and have a good, long dutch oven cry. Buck up, Gene. It's like I scream into my pillow every time I don't get a horse on my birthday: There's always next year! Guys! There's a secret boiler room in the back of the boiler room that no one knows about. I think, in the olden days, they used it as the faculty opium den. Great. So why are we here? We're here because this room happens to be under the very auditorium where Working Girl, the Musical is gonna be performed. Then this is where I want to die! No, listen! You're gonna put on the guerilla-slash-protest production of Die Hard, the Musical on the same night, in here! It's the perfect way to stick it to Courtney, right in her thunder-stealing face! (gasps) It's brilliant! The symbolism! We'll be up-staging her from down-stairs-stage! No, what's brilliant is we're going to charge five bucks a head. Wow! What a considerate and lucrative solution to Gene's problem. I know! You're the smartest person in the whole world! I know! (chanting): Louise is the best! Louise is the best! Louise is the best! Louise is the best! What? What's taking so long? Waiting is gross. Yeah, the show must go on! That's a thing, right? Well, Gene, you violated school rules by entering the prohibited secret boiler room... Yup. You decided to put on a guerilla-slash-protest play the same night as the fall musical... Amazing. Things are not stacking up in your favor here. Do you want the whole story or not, Mr. Frond? Oh, my God, every word. I could do this all night. So things were really coming together... Okay, we got the musical, we got the venue. Now all we need is the actors. Right. Do you know Sir lan McKellen? No. Crap. Hello, Courtney. Cool piece of paper. Gene, if you're here to try out for Working Girl, the Musical, you're too late. I'm posting the cast list right now. But I suppose I could work you in, as like a really stupid stapler or a desk or something. I'd be an incredible stapler! But don't even worry about it, 'cause I'm putting on a pl... Weight! He's putting on a lot of weight, not being in any plays or talking about other plays that could get him in trouble. Oh, right... Oh, well, good luck with your weight gain. Looks like you're almost there, bye! Thank you. You guys, I'm secretary number one! Eat it, two and three! Yay! Aw, man. Come on! Well, Mom, I guess I don't have the dashing good looks and charm of a medium-young Harrison Ford. I think I've found our cast. Louise: May I present the People that Didn't Get Cast in Courtney's Play But Still Want to Be in a Play Players. Yep, did not make the cut. I guess I'll have to win an Oscar for wrestling. Is it because I can't not sing like Mariah Carey?  I can't help it.  We stepped on each other's lines. We stepped on each other's lines. Miss Merkin, what are you doing here? I've played piano for the Wagstaff Musical for 24 years. Then Doug comes in and pushes me out! Well, how are you with a Casio? (plays beautiful riff, adds dog bark) I think I can manage. Oh, wait. We still need a girl to play Holly Gennaro McClane. So I guess that's you? Oh, no way. I'm that blond bad-ass guy or nothing. Fine, then it's Tina. Where is Tina? Tina:  I'm Katherine Parker  And I'm super rich  And soon you will find that I'm quite a... bleep.  Okay, so I betrayed Gene by being in Courtney's play, but I have a perfectly good explanation.  I'm a business man with a business plan  I need a business woman with some business hands...  So, yeah. Oh, God. But your characters don't even end up together! We're all allowed to interpret the movie differently. No, they definitely don't end up together. Eh, to each his own. No, they really don't. Well, comme ci comme Ã§a. All right, well, now you're just saying words. C'est la vie. Anyway, it was the day before the big show. Some of you might call it yesterday... See you at my play tomorrow night. I wrote a play, we're doing it tomorrow, see you there. Where? Wait... You hear that? It's the sound of me having a play and you not having one! It sounds like,  Yeah, I have a play and you don't have a play  I have a play, you don't have a play...  Aah! I'll show you, Courtney Wheeler! In a way that I can't tell you about right now! So never mind! Bye!  Why did you throw that corpse on my car?  'Cause I'm inviting you to the party, pal  Think we're gonna be great pals  Al and John, John and Al...  Now come here. I'm gonna wrestle ya. Get over here! Ow! Okay... Come on! Gene: No, no, no, no! John McClane is in a tower. Sergeant Al Powell is on the ground! You can't wrestle! I made a creative choice. Very bold. And Rudy, you're moving your hands too much. And quit wheezing! (wheezing): I'm sorry, the asbestos might be affecting my lungs a little, but I'll work on it. Um, can we turn down the heat? Yeah, it's boiling up in here! It's the boiler room, Zeke! It's what it does! It's like you guys don't even care about this guerilla-slash-protest musical designed to take down Courtney and send us to Broadway! Uh, Gene. (clears throat) A... a word? Mm-hmm. The play is tomorrow night. We gotta get it together. Give 'em a pep talk, you know? Put some fire in their butts! Is the putting a fire in the butt part of the inspiration, or is that a separate suggestion? Ugh, damn it. Fine. Listen up: I wrote an incredible musical. And I thought together we'd create the kind of theater that would make the gods cry. But now I'm like, "What am I, nuts?" You're all blowing it! Zeke with your wrestling, Darryl and your extra-note singing, Crazy Arm Rudy over here! Andy and Ollie, FBI agents don't hold hands! These ones do. Yeah, and they sleep in the same bed. And now I'm realizing that the only way to make this production shine is if I fire all of you and play all the roles myself! Uh... (chuckling) Say what? Except for Miss Merkin. You're my rock, girl. Thank you. And I've been thinking about getting you drums and maybe a cute top. You cool with that? You know it. So congratulations, the rest of you have been demoted to stagehands on Die Hard, the Musical, a one-Gene show! Hurray. It's gonna kick ass. So you fired the casting, and made Die Hard, the Musical a one-man show? Yes, starring me. Gene. Yeah. Okay, well, I've come to the part where I blame the parents. Bob, Linda... Hi. Uh-huh? I'm blaming you. Yeah. Oh. Why didn't you step in and do something here? Hey, we don't know all the crazy crap our kids are doing. We don't want to know. But I did start to get suspicious when we were walking into the fall musical and I found this weird thing in my pocket.  Musical! Musical!  Time to watch your sister in a musical!  Wait, what's this weird thing in my pocket? Louise: See you in there! "You are invited to attend the performance "of Die Hard, the Musical, "a one-Gene show, in the secret boiler room at school tonight." Gene's in a musical at school, too? Tonight? Oh, my God, our kids are in competing musicals! I always dreamed this night would happen. Aw... That's your dream? Yeah, Tina's the president and this. Well, I guess one of us should go to Gene's play. I call Working Girl! Ugh, fine, I'll go backstage to wish Tina good luck. Hey, my little Sigourney Weaver-achiever. How's your stage fright, honey? It just so happens I found the only cure. (whispering): It's his butt. Dad, Jocelyn's shoulder pads are too big! She's stuck in the doorway! (grunts) Just kick her from behind! Sheesh! Theater people! So dramatic. God, I love it. (laughs)  I want to sing, I want to dance  I want to act, I want to play!  Um, Mom?  Yeah...  Oh, sorry. No! This is Carly Simon's seat. Are you Carly Simon? Uh, no. I know you're not! Wow. Carly Simon's gonna be here?! Psst, Dad! What? Come with me. Oh, um, I think your mom was gonna go to Gene's weird play, and I was gonna stay here and watch Tina. Uh, I don't think so. We need your giant body to make the audience look fuller! But Working Girl's the film that inspired me to be anything I wanted to be! And so you're this? Come on, Dad! (sighs) Fine. Hey, if you want to see some real, gritty theater, we got Die Hard, the Musical down in the basement. Only five bucks! Louise, don't bother these people. Plus, that's not gonna work. Oh. I'm a Die Hard freak. Check it out. Bonnie Bedelia. Also, I'm just an uncle, so no biggie. (chuckles) Louise: Here ya go, champ. Geez, it's hot in here. Whoa, is that a rat? Yes, it is. Huh. I guess Bob went to Gene's play. My son's doing Die Hard, the Musical, in the basement. It's a competing musical. It's competing with this one right now. Shh! Aah, you're jealous. Shh.  This is a boat  A boat that is a ferry  Ferry on the water  Staten lsland Ferry  I'm a working girl  A workin' working girl  I'm a girl who's working  I work...  In New York Ci... ty  Gene: All aboard the plane from New York to Los Angeles! (imitating airplane engines) Thanks, Argyle. Boy, that guy on the airplane was right about taking my shoes off.  I'm a barefoot cop... oh!  Coffee, coffee  Coffee, coffee  Coffee's all I get  Coffee, coffee  How'm I gonna get ahead...  Coffee, coffee...  Gene:  I'm Grubin'  I'm Hans Gruber and I'm Grubin'  And sometimes that can mean shootin'  Mr. Takagi in the head...  Hey, this is Katherine, you work for me  I've broken my leg while trying to ski  Do me a favor and fill in for me  Even though I stole your radio deal idea  For Trask Industries...  You did what?! That's my daughter! Shh! Jealous. This is everything that's wrong with Broadway today. Die Hard, one-man-show, in the basement. Blow your mind! Okay. Aw, I'm missing it! Maybe I can pop down for a bit. There I go.  Fight scene, fight scene  We're gonna have a fight scene  (grunting) Oh, my God. Eh, 'scuse me, eh, 'scuse me. I know, right? He's magnificent! Ooh, it's warm in here. Hey, did Louise charge you five bucks? Yes. Ooh, rat!  I have a head for business  And a bod for sin  Well I want both, so count me in!    Smile. Smile! What the hell? Where is everybody?! Hey, hey, hey! Where are you going? Uh... nowhere. And, uh, not to the Die Hard musical in the basement. Great job, Jimmy Jr.! (whoops) Thanks, Dad. Where the hell is Carly Simon?! She, uh, left a message! She's getting drive through... for everyone.  Oh, the life of the wife of a cop  Makes my head spin around like a top...  Hey, hey! Five bucks! What's going on?! You're doing your Die Hard musical?! Oh, I love the Holly Gennaro McClane number. Oh, my God! He's musical battling us. I've seen it a million times! Stop it! Stop that singing right now! Nobody tells my son to stop singing! Well, actually, I've probably seen enough. Keep going, baby!  That Johnny McClane's  Driving this gal insane...  I'll make him stop. (slow-motion): Daddy, no! (grunting in slow motion) (audience gasping) (slow-motion): Huh? (gasping) Ugh! Wow. Yes! That man hit my son with a shoulder pad. Hold on! I accidentally grabbed a shoulder pad, maybe it went flying, maybe not. And then she came after me! And Bob pushed me! Hey, I was just pushing you away from Linda. She's crazy. That's right, honey! Oh, my God. I'm rich. What? Nothing. Well, I think I've heard everything. Great, let's all go watch the end of my play. I hear the finale is amazing. No, no, my play! Nobody wants to watch you running around changing wigs! Tell that to British Parliament! I-I have to admit, watching one person do Die Hard is a little... bad. (gasps) Father! Hey, at least Gene's was raw! From the gut. Courtney's was all slick like a kid didn't even do it. That's because a kid could never do it. Never! Oh, yeah? My son's not the one who promised Carly Simon, and then left everyone hanging! She just texted me that she was car-jacked, but she's still going to try to make it! So we should finish our play, Mr. Frond. Yeah! (stammers) No, no, no, no, no. My mother was right. This musical theater stuff is just too dangerous. So for the safety of everyone, there will be no more musicals tonight. And maybe ever! Louise: What? Linda and Tina: No! I don't know if I have that authority, but at least for tonight, it's finished. Oh, come on! No! What happened? Are we gonna finish the play? No, come here. Shh-shh-shh. Come here, come here. We'll get through this. I-I-I don't want... No. No, thanks. Okay, time to go home, everyone. Show's over. (all groaning) Yeah, the whole night was a bust. Come on, Gene. Let's go home. Wait! Mr. Frond! What? I guess one boy, no matter how talented... and charismatic... and likable... doesn't have the right to ruin musicals for everyone. So, Courtney, you finish your play. Aw, Gene. So noble! No, Gene. You were right. I did steal your thunder. Working Girl is the sassy sister film to Die Hard. Everybody knows that. I was just so mad you wouldn't let me be in your play. Well, maybe we can be in each other's plays. I... What?! We just need three and a half hours to prepare. Gene, it's 9:30, and I have a lot of sweat in my underwear. Fine, fine. 25 minutes. (stammers) No way, Gene. This is done. Aw, too bad. Seems like that conflict resolution could've been epic. Maybe award winning. Oh, my God. You think I could win a Conflicty for this?! Yeah, you could win a Conflicty! Let's do it! (all cheering) All right, come on, everybody! Take my hands. No, wait, wait. Whoa. We got to do this ourselves. It's what Tess McGill would've wanted. But Courtney, honey... (muffled mumbling) Sometimes... Shh! Sometimes to break through the glass ceiling, you got to break some hearts. And glass. You probably think this slap is about you. Ow! So I don't know if we can pull this off, I mean, we wrote and rehearsed it in under 20 minutes, but if we do, it's because we did it together. All of us. That's exactly what people say before they make a baby, I think. Okay, well, without any further ado, we present to you the musical rom-com-slash-action-thriller, Work Hard or Die Trying, Girl. Oh, no! We're a bunch of secretaries from New York held hostage in Nakatomi Towers! Shush! I'm Karl, the one with beautiful hair! I'm Hans Gruber. Consider yourself Grubed! Tess McGill can't let a bunch of terrorists ruin her dream. I hope the police come soon. Ow! Glass! Hurtin' John McClane's feet!  I'm Agent Johnson  And I'm Agent Johnson  And we're from the FBI  I'm Johnson He's Johnson!  He's Johnson I'm Johnson!  Both:  Two fancy-footed federal guys  I might just be a local cop  But will you guys back off me?  Things are getting pretty tense  Does anybody want coffee?  You know we're not so different, you and I.  We're both ambitious, Hans  Tess McGill, you've stolen this Gruber's heart.  Like I'm stealing  Like you're stealing  These bearer bonds  I cracked the co... de So here's the bearer bonds.  Which is the same as money, I guess. Hey, let's make that radio deal. Hip hop? Hip hop.  Mwah! That's not in the script. Just go with it... they love it! Is that two rows of teeth I'm feeling? My baby teeth never fell out. And Jack Trainer and I are a couple now as well, so that's good. Hip hop. Hip hop.  Hans, you're feeling love's great power  But now I got to push you off the tower!  Now come here. I'm gonna get ya. Come on. (screams) I'm so mad about my brother so I k*ll you about it! No...! (screams) Thanks, Al! If only there was a place where we could all be happy and not get k*lled! All:  Maybe there's a tower  Somewhere up above  Filled with bearer bonds and love  Where dreams don't die hard  Maybe there's a tower  Somewhere up above  Filled with shoulder pads and love  Where dreams can fly hard  But until we can live in that imaginary world  We'll work hard or die trying, girl.  Yes! Yes! (whoops) Oh, my God! Carly Simon? Who? Oh, sorry. Y-You... you look like Carly Simon. You look like Carly Simon. It's a compliment. Back off. Sorry. Geez. I smell a Tony! Which is also what happens to be what I call my farts.  Work hard...  Or die trying,  Woman:  Ooh, you work hard, you die hard  Work hard  Gene: You work hard! Zeke: Come on, come on! Woman:  Oh!  Or die trying, girl  You work hard, you try hard  Ooh...  Work hard  Ooh-ooh-ooh...  Or die trying, girl  Gene: Yeah!  You work hard, you die hard  Work hard  No, no, no, no, no  Work hard...  Or die trying, girl  Gene:  Ooh, yeah! 
Two days until trick-or-treating? What am I supposed to eat until then? Other food? I know. Like what? Like, bread? I don't know if I'm gonna go trick-or- treating this year, guys. All the bigger kids are hanging out at the old cemetery. Hi, Jimmy Jr. Are you going to the cemetery on Halloween? Follow-up question: what time were you planning on going? 'Cause I'm planning on going at that time, too. I'm going when all the other kids are going. Oh, cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. But why does everybody want to go to a stupid cemetery on a day when you can knock on people's doors and they literally hand you free candy? And then you kiss them on both cheeks! So, just to nail this thing down, we're going to the cemetery together? (scoffs) Geez, Tina. Everybody's going at the same time. We're not going together. It's a group activity. Kids go and break into the mausoleum. It's a rite of passage! Mm-hmm. So you think that's, like, 8:30? Maybe touch base around 8:15? (groans) I'll just see you there if I see you. God, he was all over you. (humming happily)  Ghosts and goblins, goblins and ghosts, yeah.  This year I got the bats that are smiling. It's more realistic. Why is it more realistic? 'Cause they're happy. It's their favorite holiday. They love it. Hi, I'm the exterminator. Oh, hi. From Hugs Not Bugs, the sensitive bug killers. Well, the name is misleading. We actually use a highly toxic chemical. It hugs them to d*ath, really slowly. They suffer. I'm Marcus. Uh, they showed up the other day. I-I don't know what they are. They're weird. Uh, everything okay? (gasps) This isn't good. What-what isn't good? This is very bad. What is very bad? This is really creeping me out. You're creeping me out. What-What's going on here? Linda: Bobby! Is he squirting poison? The kids just got home and they want to watch. There is definitely an otherworldly presence in this basement. A what? A presence. Wait, are you saying "presence"? A presence? Presents? I always thought there should be Halloween presents! No, not presents. A presence. A ghost. There's a ghost in this basement. Yes! What? A ghost? Who said "ghost"?! We have a ghost? Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Oh, my God. You need to catch it and get rid of it. Like salmon. Whoa, whoa... Marcus. Hi. Hello. Uh, question. Did you say we have to catch the presence? Yes. How does one do that? First, you got to make contact with the ghost. Then you got to try to get it into a vessel. A vessel? Yeah, like a bottle. Or a box. Oh, a vessel. Cool. Can you please get rid of the bugs first? Dad! So we get it into the box. And then what? Throw away the box in the trash. Great. Now on to the bugs. Can you just squirt them with your thing now? No way. Those are probably phantasmal bugs attracted to the spirit world. Sure, sure. Phantasmal bugs. I'm not going down there. I got to go. You cannot be a real exterminator. I'm licensed and I'm running away. Bye, Marcus! Bye. Uh, I'm not paying you for this! I'll get the Ouija board! And a box! And candles! And some smooth jazz. Well, the restaurant is closed. Thank you so much for not helping out at all tonight. You're welcome. I called another exterminator, not that you care. So, yeah, just go ahead, do your capture-the-ghost séance. Gene: Mm-hmm. Linda: All right, so here's our vessel. I brought my Easy Breezy shoe box. It used to hold the world's most comfortable heels. Now it's gonna hold a ghost. What a life this box has had. Okay. Here we go. We're gonna make contact with the other side. I just need one more sip of my séance wine. Yep. If you make contact, can you ask the ghost if it's any good with a mop? Ha-ha. Very funny. Open the door. (exhales) Attention, ghost. We are gathered here today to help you cross over into this box. Kids, put your hands on the thingy. Question one: is there a spirit here in this basement? It's moving! (all gasp) Great. They're in here, too. Hey, guess what. You're not phantasmal. You're phan-dumb. (chuckles) (screams) Oh, my God! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! Ooh... What is your name? What's your name, baby? Tina: Stop moving it, Louise. I know it's you. I'm not moving it. It's Gene. It's not me. Ooh! Look, it's spelling something out. Louise: J... (groaning) E... F... Linda: F. Jeff. I just got chills. How old are you, Jeff? One. Three. So the ghost is a 13-year-old boy. That's interesting. To all of us. Jeff, do you, uh, want to check out the inside of this totally normal shoe box? (gasps) I think he's in the box! Put the lid on it! Got it. (grunts) Hello? Did anybody hear me screaming? There was a crazy amount of bugs flying at my face. Bobby, calm down. We caught the ghost. His name is Jeff. Everything is fine. Everything is not fine, Lin. We have a horrible bug problem in there, and I'm sick of all this ghost stuff. Ghost stuff is over. Now we do the ceremonial throwing it away in the trash. No, wait! Don't! You can't just throw Jeff out. Ghosts were people, too. What if it's Jeff Bridges? Imagine the money. Tina, what are you doing? We're keeping Jeff. You can keep him, Tina, but you have to empty his box every night! (groans) So, Jeff, how's your first day at school going? Which is worse: purgatory or the smell in Tina's locker? It doesn't smell anymore, Louise; I got rid of the yogurt. Why do you guys have an Easy Breezy's shoe box? I didn't know it was Take Your Mom's Shoes to School Day. (both laugh) There aren't shoes in this box. It's a ghost. Mm. You're totally lying. And lying is bad for your skin, thank you. Why is everyone looking at a box? What am I missing? I'm bored. Somebody explain it to me quick! It's a ghost. His name is Jeff. It's a strong Christian name. You have a ghost, Tina? Oh. Hi, Jimmy Jr. This is Jeff. He's a ghost, he's a boy, and we've been spending a lot of time together. Ghosts aren't real. Yeah. d*ath is the end. It's final! That's right, Zeke. Yeah, nothing more! High five! Really? Well, maybe Jeff will have something to say about that. Anyone want to talk to him? I do. Okay. All right. Hands on the Ouija board, everybody. You can ask him anything you want about the afterlife. All right. If you're real, what do ghosts eat? It's moving. Zeke: S... O... U... P. Soup! He's right! Must be real. Whoa. This changes a lot for me. A lot. Are you okay, Zeke? No, this is weird. Well, Zeke's changed. Who's next? I have a question. Were you cool when you were alive? V... E... R... Y. Very! Jeff is cool! (sighs) I-I don't think Jeff is real. Something smells fishy. "U." (laughing): Oh, man. He got you! Ghost burn. (others laugh) That's not funny. Jeff's funny. (school bell rings) Uh-oh. Time's up everyone. Wait, wait. One more question. Hey, Jeff, do you want to walk me to class? Jocelyn: You go, girl. He has a creepy crush on you. Weird. We have to call another exterminator. Let's go with... "Beetle Kanevil"? What is wrong with the exterminators in our town? Why don't you ask him? (screams) Marcus! I just wanted to show this place to some of my friends. This is Phil and Don. Hi. Wait, what? They're gonna check it out. I'm gonna run away. Bye, Marcus! Good luck! I hope you don't die! He always says that. What are you doing? What's all this? Mm. I'm definitely recording some EMF traces in here. We just might have something substantial on our hands. (gasps) Are you paranormal investigators? Guilty. I'm Don, vice president of our local chapter. This is Phil. He's president. Mm-hmm. Voted in by a landslide. One vote. It was me. Uh, you can't do that stuff in here. This is a business. So, Marcus told you about our ghost. His name is Jeff. Uh, he's doing great. I mean, he's adjusting well. I... Bob, do you think he's... comfortable? Lin, stop. There is no ghost. Oh, boy. Don, you're gonna want to take a look at this. Okay. This booth is covered in some serious spectral traces. My meter's going crazy. Mine, too. Of course, it could be cell phone interference. Mm-hmm. Or an AM radio. Or a microwave. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. But I bet it's a ghost. Mm-hmm. Oh! You hear that, Bob? A ghost. Uh-huh. Looks like we got our work cut out for us. Phil, you think we should order some lunch? Burger. Medium well. Man knows what he wants. That's why he's president. Ow. What's going on here? Um, nothing. Don't mind them. Can I help you? They have a ghost. We're here to investigate. No, there's no ghost. Don't listen to him. He's... Honey, they have a ghost. Let's eat here. I mean, yeah, we have a ghost. Uh, come on in. Sit down. We have at least one in every booth. Jeff, people are loving you! Tina's hanging out with the most popular box in the school. I don't even care that he's popular. To me, he's just Jeff. Bye. Wait, wait, where are you going? Oh, I was thinking of showing Jeff the butterflies at the science center. You guys don't want to come along, do you? Probably not. Great. Bye. Jeff, you have my sister home by 11:00! Wait, make that 9:00, 8:00 central! Jeff and I are gonna watch Kitchen Nightmares. That's gonna be our thing! The butterflies are beautiful this time of year. The rest of the time, they're caterpillars. Are we holding hands? I can't really tell. Jeff, you'd tell me if you were just a box, right? You're just a box, aren't you? I'm on a date with a box. Oh, my God. Whoa. I'm getting butterfly kisses from a butterfly. Is it you, Jeff? Is this a sign? (kissing) Oh, boy. You really are real. Man: What are you doing? (gasps, coughs) No, no, no. No eating the butterflies! What is in the box? Um... Jeff. Who's Jeff? Oh, wow. Um... you're kind putting us on the spot here. Is he a friend? Is he more than a friend? We're just enjoying it right now without labels. Oh. (chuckles) I thought it was food or drink. Enjoy your visit.     Lin, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad a crazy exterminator told us we had a ghost. Big day. People like your burgers more when there's a dead person in the restaurant. Okay, people. We're gonna listen for subsonic metaphysical phenomena now. We need everybody to be very quiet in here. Except for ghosts. You guys talk it up. Hi, everyone! Oh! Ah! Oh, my. Oh. Damn it. We have an announcement. We're officially dating. Ooh! Ghost boyfriend! You'll have to get some clanking chains for prom. Aw. Wait. Is there a ghost in that vessel? Did you just say you two were dating? Dad, you're not gonna like every guy she brings home. Mm, I'm getting some heavy activity. Of course you are. It's Jeff. He's like that. Congratulations, Bob. He seems great. Yep. Every father's dream. Aw. There he is! Coolest guy in school. What's up, Jeff? Oh, hi, everyone. Uh, me and my boyfriend Jeff were just looking to have a little lunch. (all gasping) Oh, my God, did you just say "boyfriend"? Did I? Oh, yeah, I did. Hmm. You guys are so cute together! You're the new "it" couple! Whoa, people, give them some space here. No photos! Well, Jeff and I are gonna get in line. God, just leave him here for a second. You're smothering him, Tina. Let him breathe. He's already in a box. Yeah, let him hang out with us. This ghoul needs some guy time. Come on, Jeff! I'm gonna get ya! Get over here, all right! Oh. Uh, okay. We'll do our own thing for a bit and then meet up later. See you in a few, Jeff. I'm gonna get you! Get over here. Miss you already. (laughs) Get your ass up here! Come on. Careful. I'm back, Jeff. Hope you like hot dogs... Where did Jeff go? Tammy got some mustard on Jeff's box, so she went to wash it off. (Tammy screaming) Tammy: You guys, get in here! I went into the stall to go number one, because I never go number two at school, or at all, because that's gross, and Jocelyn clogged the toilet that one time. I'm sorry, Jocelyn. But look what I found when I came out! (all gasping) Huh? "Tina and I are taking a break. "Tammy, you are hot. Be my GF." Wait. What? Jeff asked me out! And of course I said "no" 'cause that's not fair to Tina. Just kidding! I said yes! Oh, yay! Oh, my God, you guys are the coolest couple in school! You deserve it. I guess now I have a hottie without a body. Come on, Jeff. Nobody's saying it, but Jeff is a scoundrel! He's buried, not married! (groaning) (groaning) I can't believe Jeff dumped me for Tammy. Since when can Jeff write on mirrors? I'm pretty sure that's his handwriting. It's girly, but it's just 'cause he's sensitive. (toilet flushes) The girl's bathroom is nice! Each stall has a tiny metal mailbox. I'm glad I was carrying around that postcard for Ken. I don't know how I'm gonna make it through the rest of the day. Come on, Tina, get off the floor. What's the big deal? He's not even... hot... for a box. Tina: That's not what I care about. I care about what's inside. Also, we don't know if that's water or urine you're lying in. Tina: I think it's just water. Yeah, water. No, pee. Tina, they're gonna do an ultrasound on your box. The box didn't quite make it home with us today. Kids, there's a lot of people who are very focused on the box. Where's the box? Did he switch vessels? No, he didn't switch vessels. He switched girlfriends! To an annoying girl named Tammy! Ugh! I hate his stupid ghost face! (gasps) He dumped you?! I'm gonna k*ll him. Again. Oh, I knew this would happen. Sort of. Spirit appears to be a bit of a player. Linda: Tina's gonna be okay. I made her a PB and J. She said she didn't want it, so I ate it. She was still sad, so I made her another PB and J. She didn't want that one either, so I ate it. Anyway, Tina wants to be alone for a little while, and we're out of peanut butter. Guys, I hate to break your hearts, too, but Jeff isn't real. What are you talking about? I was controlling the Ouija Board. I was messing with you guys. Yeah. I thought that was pretty obvious. I named him Jeff. It's the stupidest name for a ghost I could think of. (laughing) Of course. Oh, yeah. I know Jeff's not real. It was Louise. Sure. Wait, so let me get this straight. His name's not Jeff, but he's real. No, Gene, there is no Jeff! I just thought it would be funny. I didn't think Tina would fall in love with him. And I definitely didn't think Tammy was gonna pull the same crap as me but better with that mirror thing. And now I'm gonna go tell Tina and say I'm sorry, and we're all gonna laugh about this someday, right, guys? I don't think that's such a good idea. Lin, why is that not such a good idea? 'Cause Tina's already feeling heartbroken right now. If we tell her the truth, she's gonna feel heartbroken and dumb. She got catfished by a box! So... I'm not telling Tina? You'll see. You'll all go trick-or-treating tomorrow. She'll be fine. She'll be back to her normal, teeny Tina. She just needs nougat. Happy Halloween! I'm a witch! Costume fashion show! Get out here, kids! Here comes Gene! Turner and Hooch. Half dog, half Hanks, all cop! More like Turner and Cute. Come here, you! (makes silly kissing sounds) Oh, here comes Louise. Shiny scorpion person. Wow! I'm Ryan Gosling from the major motion picture trailer Drive. So violent, but so well-reviewed. And here she is, last but not least, Tina! Dressed as a... pretty glasses girl. Wait. You didn't change at all. I'm not gonna go trick-or-treating, guys. What? No. You should go! Eat your candy. You need it. Yeah, no, I'm just gonna hang out here for a while. And later, I might stop by the cemetery. If I don't show my face now, I'll never be able to do it. What? Why would you go there? Tammy's gonna be there. And a certain cardboard box. Ruff! You guys go ahead without me. I'll be fine. I'll just watch other people have fun on Halloween. That kid's having fun. Glad Tina's okay. Time to go trick-or-treating! Are you kidding me? Tina is not okay. Look at her. I know what we have to do now. Tammy's going down, and she's going down with a strong dose of her own medicine. Which I invented! Love it. One suggestion. Can we go trick-or-treating for a couple of hours, and then see how we feel? No, Gene! Can we just stop for ramen? (whooping) Ha, all right! We're the older kids now! Hanging out in the cemetery! Man, in a few years, we'll be parents! And I have a serious boyfriend. So, uh, I guess we're supposed to break into that creepy mausoleum, huh? It's a rite of passage. Hey, we got a ghost with us. We're good, right? Jeff, you know the doorman? (both laughing) Oh. Oh, man. Louise: Hey, guys. (kids scream) Oh. Um, you two have, like, zero out of ten permission to be here. You're too young. Yeah, little fetuses. (growls) Hooch, heel! Where's Tina? Crying into her butt? (laughs) TINA: No. My butt is dry... and strong. Ew. Ruff! Good boy. Hey, Louise. Tina, I'm glad you're here. You're gonna want to see this. I thought you guys were gonna go trick-or-treating. And I thought you guys were gonna actually go into the mausoleum. We're going! We're just... we're just getting our legs ready. Look, here they go! We're about to march right in! Tammy? Tammy? What? What? It's so awkward that Jeff's ex is here. It's like so... You could cut the tension with a knife. No, like, whatever. I'm so confident, because Jeff is, like, so over her. (doors creak) (chuckles) Come on, legs. Good, great, come on. Keep going! You can shake, but you can't quit on me! I can't see anything! (light thudding) Whoa. Someone just knocked Jeff out of my hands! You guys don't even care! Jocelyn: I would care, but I'm too scared! Jimmy Jr.: Zeke, light the rite of passage candle. Here you go! I took it from my Dad's Jacuzzi tub. Here's your boyfriend, Tammy. I found him on the ground. You should really be more careful. Great. Now he's got ground on him. Sorry the candle smells like lavender. Kind of changes the vibe a little bit. Yeah. I'm feeling really relaxed all of a sudden. (doors slam, kids screaming) The door slammed shut! Well, somebody open it! It's locked! I can't open it! No! (crying): Oh, no. Tina, try it again! I can't budge it. It just won't open. (quietly): Louise, how'd you do that? I didn't. That wasn't part of my plan. Well, then what was your plan? I put some bugs from the basement in Tammy's box. That's it? Gene, you were there. You helped me get the bugs. I know. I just thought there was gonna be more to it. But, yeah, no, it's-it's good. Zeke: Oh, my God! Guys, look at this! "You are all condemned to eternal damnation in here with me. This is... Jeff!" (kids gasp) Jeff trapped us! Not cool, Jeff! Not cool. 'Oh, no! Eternal damnation sounds bad and long! It's the worst kind of damnation! If you really aren't doing this, Louise, Hooch is gonna have an accident. I swear it's not me. (Tammy screams) I knew I shouldn't have taken Tina's spooky seconds! Ugh! (groaning) Got her. Uh-oh. This might have backfired a little bit. They're on me! They're on me! (kids yelling) Listen! Listen to me! I have something to say. We're not trapped in here for eternal damnation. I wrote that. Louise: What?! Jeff the ghost isn't real. My sister made him up. Dude, what?! Oh, my God. That was me. Uh, hi, everybody. The bugs were also me. Part of me always kind of thought Jeff was fake. But then, last night, when I heard my family talking about how fake he was, I realized that he definitely was fake. Mm. Ah. Also, it's crazy. It's a box. But the things we wanted from Jeff were real. I wanted a boy to pay attention to me and never leave my side. Ah. Oh, man. I wanted to believe that there's more than this life. I wanted to believe so bad. It's okay, Zeke. (crying): Oh, God. It just means take advantage of the here and now. Oh, I hear you, man. And I wanted someone to watch Kitchen Nightmares with. And I just liked him 'cause everyone else liked him. I need to start thinking for myself, unless you guys don't think that's cool. Then I won't. And Tammy wanted to steal someone away from me because she's a horrible, jealous girl. She's right! Tammy's a handful! But we don't need Jeff. We can get these things from ourselves. Ah! I don't need a boy to pay attention to me. I'll pay attention to myself. And, Gene, it's okay to watch Kitchen Nightmares alone. And it's okay that I'm jealous and terrible. No, no. Fix yourself! Holy crap! Tina, you're amazing. I can't believe you planned this whole thing. You-you shut the door and pretended it was locked. You came here early and wrote this on the wall. What'd you use, by the way? Hopefully, not paint. It's ketchup. Checks out. Listen, I'm really sorry I made up a ghost that you fell in love with. It's okay. It was good practice for when a real ghost comes along. Well, you made this the best Halloween ever. And there's still time to go trick-or-treating! It's 10:30. It's too late. Ah, damn it, Jimmy Jr.! Why do you always know the time?! I have a watch. Oh. Quick, to the Pacific time zone! It's still Halloween in San Diego! I'll be honest. I miss Jeff. Well, Bob, we have a lot of data to sift through. We got to get back to the lab. Let's, uh, close out your tab here. You guys ate, uh, 11 burgers. All delicious. We were about to settle the bill with you, too, Bob. Let's see. We did a beta wave test, a black light scan and an audio spectral recording. With all these services rendered, looks like it's gonna be a wash. Bye, Bob. Bye, Linda. You can't leave. You have to pay for your food. We can't pay you. Mm. Why? Should we tell him, Phil? Mm-hmm. We've been dead for 12 years. Oh, my God! Bobby, they're ghosts! I knew it. Bye! Wait, wait, wait. Wait. Hold on. Watch out, Bobby! They're gonna walk right through you! Do you take credit cards? Oh, they're not ghosts.
I hope you didn't need this jar. We're getting into canning. What are you gonna can? Farts. Oh! When you need one, you don't have one. And when you have one, you need more! Wash it when you're done! Wait. If we freeze the fart, it'll last forever! It'll be all that's left of the human race when the aliens show up. Ha-ha, aliens! We farted on you! Hey, let's go down and see if we can make the walk-in cold enough to make fartcicles. Guess who just went to the doctor for his five-year checkup? Kirstie Alley. Me. Longest I've been naked in three years. Well, what'd he say? Doctor stuff. You know, "Your cholesterol is off the charts." "You absolutely must change your eating habits, or you will die." Anyway, one cheeseburger and fries, please. Maybe you should be a little concerned, right? You eat a burger pretty much every day. That-that can't be good for you. Yeah. Right. Don't you eat your burgers every day? Not every day. Yeah. We order off-menu. It's how we have fun, right? (laughs) k*ll me. Ha-ha, that's nice. Anyway, cheeseburger and fries, please. You sure you want to ignore your doctor, Teddy? I'm not ignoring him. I'm just not listening to him. (snoring) (phone rings) Bob's Burgers. Man: This is Teddy's doctor. Let's take a look at Teddy's heart, shall we? Okay. Whoa. That's strange. Oh, hey... hey, that tickles! What are you doing? (laughs) Whoa. Look at that. Sick! Can I bring that to show-and-tell?! Doctor: See how disgustingly unhealthy it is? And it gets bigger and bigger with every burger you serve him. Uh... Doctor, stop shoving burgers into his heart! Oh, but I'm not, Bob. You are. Mmm! Keep 'em coming, Bob. Oh, God, no! Keep 'em coming... No! Keep 'em coming! It's gonna pop! It's gonna blow! I'm sorry, Teddy! What? What happened? What-what happened? I'm k*ll*ing Teddy. What? You're gonna k*ll Teddy? All right, car's gassed up. That's good. Guess I could home-school the kids 'cause... No, Lin, the burgers are k*ll*ing him. What? The ones I give him every day. Oh. Gotcha. Good God, Linda. You had all that ready? What? I'm just being supportive. Good night. (shuddering) Lowering the temperature a few degrees really works. I should have worn my higher socks. You guys call them pants. Is it frozen? Sorry, kids, no fartsicles. Just disappoint-sicles. Well, this experiment was a bust. Aah! Stupid patch of ice! Sorry, you're not stupid. You're just slippery. Hold on. This stupid patch of ice might actually be a genius. (all grunting) And tomorrow, the walk-in goes from stinky to rinky. Feels weird cooking a veggie burger. Plus, he's going to know it's not a hamburger. Nah, nah, Teddy'll eat whatever you put in front of him. Remember when he ate that receipt? Well, I hope you're right. This tastes kind of funny. You don't need to look at it. Just eat it. It tastes burger-ish, but not good. Is that what you were going for? It's a... (muttering): Veggie burger. It's a what? A veggie burger?! Listen... Agh! Ugh! Why would you do that? Oh! Why? Oh! Teddy... Now I can't get the taste out of my mouth. Ugh! Look, I can't in good conscience serve you a burger every day. I don't see you shoving a veggie burger down Mort's throat, and he eats a burger every day. That's not true. I often get the soup. What?! You do? Soup?! Take it easy, Teddy. Wait. Teddy, you eat a burger every day? Of course I do! That's messed-up. You eat a lot of burgers, Mike, the mailman! Yeah, but I walk nine miles a day. Look at my calves. Wait. Don't look at my calves. They're not that impressive. Okay, here's the deal, Teddy. I'll-I'll make you soup or salad, but I don't think I can serve you my burgers anymore. You cutting me off, Bobby? I guess I am. You're cutting me off?! Is this some kind of sick joke?! I think it's for your own good. You stay the hell out of this, Mort! Bob, if you take your burgers from me, I will m*rder you and your mouthy wife. What? Huh? I'm sorry! I don't know what I'm saying. I'll k*ll you! Give me a burger! Teddy! Calm... down. You calm down! (groaning) Oh, my God. (Linda gasps) Whoa. I will replace that. I don't want to be alive. I don't want to be alive! He's handling this well. Mm-hmm. (alarm buzzing) Fire! There's a fire. Fire! No, Lin, it's the alarm clock. What? Snooze it. Oh, you know the buttons don't work. I have to unplug it. (mumbling) Louise: Someone unplug the alarm clock! (buzzing stops) Thank you! Where are you going so early? I told Teddy I'd go jogging with him. He wants to prove to me that he's healthy enough to be un-cut-off from our burgers. Why are you running if you don't want to? Just tell your teacher you have sciatica. I think it's sweet you're helping your best friend. Teddy's not my best friend. Teddy thinks you're best friends. He does? Linda: Sure. Eugene: Yup. Wait. Who's your best friend then? Mm... probably Walter Russo. Walter Russo?! When was the last time you talked to Walter Russo? (yawns) I don't know, like, six years ago. Bob, you see Teddy every day. Yeah, but Teddy's not my best friend, Lin. He's my best customer. There's a big difference. And I really value that 30 inches of Formica that's between us. Are you talking about your dingdong, Daddy? Brag. Yeah, well, off to take my best customer jogging so his heart doesn't explode. All right, have fun. Louise: Are you all in bed with Mom? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Coming up, coming up. (Louise hums) Oh, our little seal platform. (sighs) (ringing) What is that? My alarm clock. Got to go. (gasps) Oh! Uh, we gotta go check on... nothing! Oh, yeah, maybe the nothing's ready! Aw. (mumbling) (gasps) It's... perfect. Huh? Look how high my knees are! (panting loudly) I'm in great shape. Great enough for one burger? I don't think so, Teddy. Oh. Should we call the cops? Some kind of early morning gang brawl? Wait... I-I think they're fake fighting. Excuse me. What-what's going on over there? It's called stuntman boot camp. I'm in the best shape of my life. You're a stuntman? No. I just train like one. You should check it out. (hooting) BOTH: Whoa. Grenade! (yelling) And another grenade! (yelling) Got to admit, that looks kind of cool. Sort of cool. Well, that guy doesn't look cool. All right, great "grenadies," everybody. Now, don't forget to sign up for the intensive, weekend-long, stuntman boot camp in the woods. Where you might learn how to do this. Go ahead. Now this is actually a ten-story burning building, and I'm on fire. Ow! On fire! Oh, wow. I'm on fire! I'm on fire! So much fire! Falling and rolling like you're on fire burns as many calories as running, people. That is why, pound for pound, stuntmen are the greatest athletes in the world. Up top! Huh. I thought it was golfers. It's not golfers? Holy frozen nips! Look at this place! It's so slippery! (stammering) Yeah, we like it. It's all right, I guess. So, what do you do down here? Well, we've experimented with lots of stuff. We tried curling. Tina: We tried lying on the ice. That was refreshing. Some of us didn't like it as much as others, but we respect their opinions. Louise: And ice fishing. Gene: We did not get a bite. In the end, the most fun thing to do is this! (groaning) Whoa! So... pushing? Ice pushing. It all makes sense! Hi, Andy. Hi, Ollie. Hi, Louise and Gene and Tina's mom! Louise said to say we're meeting in the basement for homework club. Linda: Okay. Have fun. Homework club?! Oh, my God, they're doing drugs to each other! Push me till I feel something, Zeke! Well, well, well. Mom! Hey, uh, uh, we were just all getting... a-a head of... Yeah? A head of lettuce. Mom, you didn't happen to look down, did you? As a matter of fact, I'm looking down right now, Tina. (groaning) And... it's amazing! Oh, God, look at it shimmer! It's frozen water! They call it "ice," and it's gonna change the world! If you're gonna be pushing each other on the ice like this, you need to be wearing... Helmets. I know. I've been a broken record about it. No! Costumes! Glitzy ones with sequins! I want to be the bad boy of ice pushing like Elvis Stojko! And I want to be the bad boy of public radio, like Elvis Mitchell! I'll go get the costumes. Ooh, and don't tell your father. We won't if you won't! Got to love that woman. (food sizzling) Hey, Lin. Whoa! Where-where... where are you going? What?! What...? What? Nowhere. What's this stuff? What? What are we doing? We're making burgers? Let's do it. Let's go. What's this? This is to-go? Hey, buddy, catch! I-I got this. Geez, Lin. Here you go. Hey, there, Teddy. One veggie burger, please. I just got to use the restroom real quick. Hmm. You ever see Teddy with a briefcase before? Only in that one play. I forgot about that. Put the coffee down! Coffee is for closers only! Teddy, what are you doing in there? Teddy: Washing my hands or something. I can hear you chewing. You're chewing a burger. (gasps) Did you get that guy to buy you a burger?! Teddy: No, I'm just checking the bathroom to see that it's not leaking. (munching) He's eating! Teddy, stop eating. Teddy (crying): You don't know how hard this is for me. I paid that guy $300 to buy me this burger. Come on, Teddy, you owe it to yourself. Teddy: No, I don't. Okay. Well, then do it for me. Ah, you're just helping me because you feel guilty. Bob: That's not why. Yeah, it is. Admit it, Bobby. Bob: No, it's not. Admit it! Teddy, it's because... you're my friend. Your best friend! I didn't say... Besties. Linda. Really, Bob? (sniffles) We're best friends? I mean...  Best friends till the very end!  Lin.  He crashes on your couch when he loses his job  A guy pulls a knife, and you jump in front  What?!  You take the blade right in the gut!  Oh, my God. Ow!  Then he holds your hand till the medic comes...  Linda, thank you. You son of a b1tch. Get in here, bestie. Oh. Okay. You got it. (Teddy grunts) You got it. Yeah.  You... feed him soup when he breaks his jaw  You help him pee when he has that thing  He's your best friend...  (Teddy laughs) (organ plays on TV) Ah, hockey. Well, I-I guess it's time to hit the hay, huh? (phone ringing) Bup-bup-bup-bup, hold on, hold on. What? What? I got to take this. Hello. Really? We got in? Ha, ha! How about that. Okay, hey, we'll see you in the morning. Tremendous news! Remember how you said that stuntman boot camp was cool? You... didn't sign us up for that, did you? Better! I signed us up for the intensive weekend boot camp retreat in the woods! What? You did? Yup, the whole weekend. So I'd watch the restaurant, the walk-in, everything in the walk-in, and you'd be gone? Huh? Ah, nothing. And it's two to a cabin, so you and me will be roomie-caboomies! I don't know, Teddy. That, um, doesn't sound like something I want to do. What?! You've always wanted to do stunts in the woods. Yeah. Get the hell out of here! Yeah, go for it, Dad. Do it! Though you've already pulled off the toughest stunt of all... raising three great kids. Yeah. Come on, Bobby. My treat! Okay, I'll go. That's, um... Thanks. Aw, it's nothin'. Well, not nothin'. I won't have electricity for three months. But yay! Teddy:  He crashes on your couch when he loses his job  Okay...  He helps you pee when you've got that thing  Okay, that's great.  He hates squirrels 'cause you hate squirrels  Please stop.  He's your best friend  Your best friend...    There's gonna be a lot of exercise this weekend. So take it easy, okay? You're not in the best shape, you know. I know, best buddy. Okay. Now I need everybody to breath out stress... Mm-hmm. (exhales) ...breath in stunts. Stunts. Congratulations, you've now got stunts inside of you. Now we're gonna get cracking and roll down these stairs here. So everybody knows that falling down a flight of stairs is the same as doing 100 sit-ups. Really? We're doing this? You're a mid-level drug dealer in an apartment stairwell. Cameras are rolling. Bang! You've been sh*t. Uh... Action! Action, man! Go! You got to go! Go! This is a go. That's you, Bobby. That was a go. Go, go, go go, go...! What? Wait a... Aah! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow. Wow! That was terrible! Wait, have you done any of your morning melees in the park? No! Oh! Well, then you could really get hurt. Linda: Welcome to the Freezer-Dome! Whoever wins this whole shebang takes this baby home! Kids: Ooh. It's beautiful. Aw. You all look so cute. Everyone got their pillows? Everyone safe? Kids: Yes. Now let's rumble! If your butt touches ice, you're dead. Really? No. No, you're just out, honey. Two kids enter, one kid leaves! Kids: Two kids enter, one kid leaves! First up, Rudy versus Louise! Go! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Why am I going against Rudy? He's a pushover, a cupcake. What? I'm tough. Rudy, I'm in your P.E. class. I was there for the kickball incident. That was humbling. Yeah. Hey, it's called weight class, cool breeze. Deal with it. You can't hang with the big boys, anyway. Oh, I can't hang with the big boys? No, I'm gonna hang with the big boys. You'll see. Look at me. Ding! (Louise and Rudy roar) Oh. All right, take care, buddy. Next! That's Mama's girl! This is sugar glass, everyone. Fights often end with someone flying through a window. It's a staple in action movies. And an amazing cardio workout, which you can incorporate into your daily routine. My grandmother does it. Now, Teddy, you're looking for the guy who kidnapped your daughter. Bob, you're the guy who kidnapped his daughter. Ooh. You are a horrible person. Teddy wants revenge. Go! Wait, why am I the person who's... (roaring) No! (grunts) Where's my daughter, punk?! (growling) (coughs) Get... Teddy, get off. Get off! Today, one of you will advance to the Freezer-Dome championship. The other one will leave in shame. But all the losers get stickers. Stickers of shame! Now fight! Clank-clank! You're going down, Zeke. Good luck with my low center of gravity. I'm practically unpushoverable. We'll see about that. Come on, girl! (grunting) (muttering) I told you you're going... (grunts) ...down. Yeah! I did it! I pushed a girl and not because I like her and didn't know how to show it! Oh. Sorry, sweetie. You got to get off the ice. Go on, get off. Louise versus Gene! Easy win, Gene. I'll be waiting for you in the finals. Well, if he shows up to the finals and looks like me, that's because it's me, Zeke! I'm Mommy to both of you, but let's see who wants Mommy's love more. Ding! I want Mom's love pretty bad, so look out. (grunting, gasping) Oh, yeah? How 'bout a little of this? (grunts) Well, you're sturdier than I thought. Sturdy and purdy. Hold on, hold on. I got something in my eye. (groans) Man, it's really in there. Gene, have a seat. This could take a while. No problem. You fell for it! Aw! She beat you fair and square, unfairly, here in the Freezer-Dome! She advances to the finals tomorrow! I'm coming for you, Zeke! Bring it on! (owl hooting) (loud snoring) (groans) You've got to be kidding me. (snoring) (coughing) Oh, my God. Oh, my God. (Darnell mimicking bugle) Wake up, stuntboys! I'm sorry that was weird... I don't have a bugle. It can't be morning. No, no, no, no, no. Big day today! You're gonna get chased by robots, get set on fire... it literally burns the calories right off. (imitating robot beeping) Freeze, human. We have apprehended you. Beep beep. All right, time-out, time-out, time-out. What is going on here? Oh, my God. You don't have the mental fortitude of someone that wants to train to not be an actual stuntman. It's like you don't even want to be here. Because I don't! What?! Look, guys, I only came here as a workout buddy for my friend Teddy because I felt guilty. I mean, he's not even my friend. What are your words even meaning? Listen, between you and me, I had to say he was my best friend so he'd get healthy and not eat my burgers all the time. Oh, I sell burgers. So he's really my best customer, 'cause all he does is shove burgers in his mouth. But he's not my best friend. Oh. Oh, my God. Hey, Teddy. Hey. So, uh, you just heard all that. And you're on fire. Those words hurt more than that fire. Yeah, he's gonna be scarred inside and outside. And o... We should put... Put him out... he's scarring. We should put him out. He's starting to scar. Yeah. How could you lie to me like that?! Who says they're someone's best friend when they're not?! I lied because I care about you. Pull over here. Here! Stop the car, Bob! You're not the only guy that serves burgers. I'm gonna be a regular at Dusty's Feedbag now, friend. Come on, Teddy, d... Oh, and one more thing... three years ago, you forgot a tomato on my burger and I said nothing... nothing! Teddy, don't go in there! You don't tell me what to do! Oh, wait, I guess this entrance isn't open. It's around the back. Then just come back here. You... Keep driving! Is it around the side or... Where am I? Something. It's right there in the front, the huge entrance. I think this door goes... Get out of here, Bob! I don't need your help! Boys and girls, girls and boys, future adults of America, it's time for the most important thing in the world... the Freezer-Dome finals! Only one of you will go home with this! (kids cheer) I want that belt. And I'm not gonna fall for your little tricks, girl. I wouldn't try to trick you, Zeke. Ding! Ow! Oh, wait, wait, wait! I got something in my eye. Hold on, hold on. All right, I guess I'll just take a seat here, bend my little knees down... Ha! Just kidding! Hey, hey, you had to try. You know why? 'Cause you're tiny! (grunts) Ah! You're home early. What, did you pull a hammy? No. Long story. Where's Linda? Downstairs, I think. Mike, what are you doing? That's weird. I'm normally over there. I thought you were with Teddy. Uh, he's at Dusty's Feedbag, his new favorite restaurant. Oh, that's not good. Why? You haven't heard of the Belt Buckle Belly Buster? They serve that there. Belt Buckle Belly Buster? It's a five-pound burger. If you eat the whole thing in a half hour, it's free, and you get your picture on the wall. Oh, no, no. No, no, no, no. Teddy! So you said it's cool to have more ice cream? Tina: You're gonna get destroyed. Throw in the towel! Never. Never, never, never! Finish her! Why you putting up a fight, you tiny sweet angel? Take your medicine, girl. Just go down. I'm s... I'm still totally gonna win, so shut your mouth. You might have beaten me, Louise, but blood is thicker than ice. But not actually. Time to unleash the beast. (inhales) (gagging) Now's your chance! (grunts) Oh, God. Oh, that's what k*lled the dinosaurs. That's awful. Ooh. Zeke is down! Louise, you win! Yay!  Everybody kiss my butt  Everybody kiss my butt  Kiss her butt  Everybody kiss my butt  Everybody kiss her butt  Everybody kiss my butt  Everybody kiss her butt  Yeah! Teddy! Bob. You didn't order the Belt Buckle Belly Buster, did you? Maybe I did, maybe I didn't. But I did. Excuse me. Uh, are you Dusty? Dusty? (chuckles) Uh, no. There's no Dusty. Uh, this is a chain, pal. I'm Kevin. I'm the manager. Listen, Kevin, you can't serve this guy your five-pound burger. Oh, okay, making a note. I can't serve someone a burger in my own restaurant. Look, Teddy is... Well... He has the biggest heart of anyone I know. Both because he's incredibly sweet but also because it's full of cholesterol. Which is why you can't serve him that huge burger... he-he might not survive it. (chuckles) Well, you know what? Big boy paid for it, so order up! Good God, look at that thing. Oh. Let me at it! You're not giving him that burger. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on, let that Belly Buster through. Please take the burger back to the kitchen, ma'am. (laughs) It is so weird that you think you work here. I just... Damn it, I don't remember hiring a fat Burt Reynolds. Look, this burger is not going anywhere. This is just fantastic. I'm gonna get to throw fat Burt Reynolds out of my restaurant! Oh, yeah? Well, I can get tough, too. And I'm staying. Guys, come on. Don't fight over me. Wait, is that what's happening? Bad news for you, Kevin. I've just been through a bunch of kick-ass training, so if you think you can just... Oh, no... Oh, yeah? Well, I hope you got trained to get your ass kicked! Actually, I did! Oh, God! Here comes the glass! (screams) Thanks for coming! Are you okay, Bobby? (groans) Real glass hurts so bad. Am I bleeding? Not, like, too much. And the concrete wasn't padded. It was so hard when-when I landed on it. Before you pass out, that's the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me. I have so much glass in myself. I'll get you out of here, buddy. All right, let's go to the hospital, Teddy. No, Bob. Let's go home. No. No, we're gonna go to a hospital... Shh, shh, shh. Home it is, Bob. Here we go, almost home. I'll just see if someone else can take me. Hey, even though I'm not your best friend, I really appreciate what you did. Look, I-I'm sorry I said you're not my best friend. Because you are. I am? Yeah, I mean, it depends on how you define it. You technically are my best friend. But, I mean... I might meet... Bup, bup, bup... stop right there, Bobby. But, I mean, I don't know who... Yeah. Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob. Eventually I... Enough. Can I carry you across the threshold? (sighs) All right. (grunting) Ow. Watch your head. Sorry. Linda: Aw, my little beat-up Bobby. Where's that belt from? Where's all the food? Shh, shh, shh, shh, shush. Is the ice helping? Pretty refreshing, right? Yes, Tina. How 'bout this? Is this helping? Thanks, Teddy. Yes, it's good. How 'bout some smelling salts? Oh, God. Come on! Oh, you come on. That fart's a winner and you know it! All right, let me smell it again. (sniffing) Yeah, you're right.  He crashes on your couch when he loses his job  Guy pulls a knife and you jump in front  You take the blade right in the gut  Ow!  Then he holds your hand till the medic comes  Yeah...  You feed him soup when he breaks his jaw  You help him pee when he has that thing  He's your best friend!  He crashes on your couch when he loses his job  He helps you pee when you've got that thing  He's your best friend  Linda and Teddy:  Your best friend! 
(birds squawking, gobbling) Whoa. Those are the birds? W-why they making that noise? Hell if I know. They've been screeching that way for the last eight hours. Where are they from? They came from a horrible crappy farm, okay? Just sign the form. I want to get out of here. Those birds give me the creeps. Come on, how bad can it be? They're just a bunch of cute little birdies. They're probably hungry. Yeah. Here you go, buddy. You want some pretzel? (screams) My hand! My hand! Not your beautiful hand! (shrieking) Tina: Whoa. Look out, everyone. Dangerous curves ahead.  Turkey trot, looking hot  Do you like these pants I got?  Ha-ha! Do you? Bob, do you? Yes. I like them. They're... fine. I love them. Wait, wait. Let me put my belt on. You sure you got enough water, Mom? Hey, you got to stay hydrated. Plus, look how little they are! So tiny. Aw! Ooh, can't wait to get out there. 500 live turkeys running with us. Mm. It's gonna be like the running of the bulls but cute and safe! Mm-hmm. And we'll be on the half-priced rides having full-priced fun. Dad, are you still mad at us for going to the festival? Mad!? No, I'm thrilled! Because you were kind of mad the other day. What? No, I was... I wasn't. Oh, right! 'Cause that's what Thanksgiving is for, running around with a bunch of birds and going on rides! Well, fine! Go! But you know what? I'm not making dinner! He's taking this pretty well. No, you're crying! I just calmly said that if you all go to Fischoeder's dumb festival instead of spending the day here, I will not be making dinner. Day off for old Bob. No big deal. No big deal! The turkey baster is in the drawer, probably pretty happy not to work, and so am I. All right, come on. Don't want to be late for the Turk-tacular Turkey Town Festival and Turkey Trot. (kids cheer) (whoops) Fine! You all go have a Turk-tacular time. So, we'll bring home some Chinese food? Yup! Or whatever you want for Thanks... I mean, regular dinner. Okay, don't start a brothel while we're gone. Just kidding, you can. And no making a fort out of the couch cushions. Just kidding, you can. But don't turn that fort into a brothel. Just kidding, you can. Oh, my God, just... I mean, it's illegal, but... I know. Just leave. Nice stems! Thank you. I'm wearing hose to compress my varicose veins. Teddy! I didn't know you were gonna run. Oh, I'll probably walk. I just wanted to see the turkeys. I worked on a turkey ranch one summer, when I was 14. I learned a lot about life. And a lot about turkey feces. Sounds like a magical summer, Teddy. Now let's hit the rides! We're not gonna get whiplash just standing here! Good luck, Mom. Bob at home, cooking away? Nah. He's boycotting Thanksgiving this year. (gasps) What? Yeah. But Bob loves Thanksgiving. I know. He's mad that we all wanted to come here instead of sitting around on the couch all day, waiting for food. Poor Bob. What a tragedy. Well, the real tragedy is that I don't have time to get nachos before we start. You know what? Maybe I do. So, I say we start on the Scramble Pan and work our way back through Violent Mountain and then the Bruise Cruise. I wouldn't mind a trip on the Tickle Boat. But, Gene, they closed it, remember? That guy died. Oh, right. But what a way to go! Yeah. Scramble Pan it is! This is... great? Not celebrating Thanksgiving is kind of great. I like it. I'm alone. I can do whatever I want. I could sit in my not-usual spot on the couch. I could even cross my legs, and no one would make fun of me. Mr. Fischoeder: Felix? Felix: Yes? Mr. Fischoeder: Have all the turkeys been fed? We aren't going to have a repeat of the unfortunate finger nibbling incident? No, Calvin. The turkeys are fine. And the chickens. And the ducks. And the geese. "Geese"? You were supposed to get 500 turkeys, Felix! You had one thing to do! One! I tried! Turkeys are scarce right now, for some reason! Oh, I wonder why that could be! Oh, I'm sorry I let you down again by buying a bunch of dangerous birds that... (amplified): (gasps) Oh, my God! The mic is on. Hi! Oh, ho! I hope you all enjoyed those Thanksgiving jokes we were just making. (both laugh uncomfortably) A little light Thanksgiving humor. Oh, I love humor. I do love to laugh! Now, on behalf of myself and my brother Calvin, we'd like to welcome you all to the first annual Turk-tacular Turkey Town Festival! All right! Is everybody ready for some poultry in motion? (gobbling) Those birds don't sound right. Tina: Hey, Regular Sized Rudy. I didn't know you were a scramblin' man. I'm not usually, but since my parents are divorced, I gotta have two dinners, so I'm trying to make myself throw up breakfast. One time I had two dinners because Ollie was too sick to eat his. I had malaria! Let's quit yakkin' and get crackin'! Mickey, come on, let's do this! Set it to maximum! Okay, hold onto your heads like this so your necks won't break! And now, the beginning of a new Thanksgiving tradition that's fun for the whole family. The Running of the Turkeys... etcetera. On your mark... get set... go! (gobbling) (crowd clamoring) (laughing) Ow! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Linda! Run! Run! Run! (woman screams) Oh. Oh... (runners screaming, clamoring) Pretty good, pretty good. I'll try right over left now. Mm, yup, yup. Also good. (runners yelling, clamoring) (man screams, chicken squawks) Oh, ah, no! Birds! Birds! Birds! Birds! Excuse me! Excuse me! Make way, make way! Sorry. Hey... Coming through! Here we go, pardon us. (panting) Oh! (squawking) (Linda grunting) (yelling) (groans) What...? What happened? Aah! I'm short and wiggly! Ooh! I'm tall and wiggly. Oh, oh, it's a fun mirror. It's a fun mirror. Aah! Linda! Aah! Linda, it's me, Teddy! From your town! Teddy? Wha-What's going on, Teddy? How did I get in here? When the birds attacked, most people got away, but you got knocked out by this freaky one-eyed cyclops turkey. So I picked you up and carried you here. Whoa! How long have I been out? A lot's changed. We don't have to start repopulating the Earth yet, but eventually we might have to do just that. I don't know... Teddy! How long have I been in here? Five, maybe six minutes. Oh. Oh, my God, the kids! Where are the kids?! But I'm a vegan! Aah! Louise: Ugh! I can't believe Mickey left us here! Those birds are getting awfully close. I hope they don't have tickets for this ride! We got to get off this thing. Andy, Ollie, you seem like you're up for a challenge of getting off the ride and shutting it down. We'll try anything. Yeah! I tried shrimp at my aunt's house! Great. Go get 'em! (both grunting) Oh, what happened? We travelled through time! I guess I'll give it a whirl. Literally. (grunting) ...whoa! Hey. Welcome back. We're gonna die like we were born. Spinning around in an egg! That really makes you think. This is great. Don't have to keep getting up to baste. Baste not, want not. You get it? Yes. I don't have to storm the Baste-ille. Eh. Get it? Kind of. It was a prison in France. The Bastille, and I said "Baste-ille." Oh. I'm here live at the wharf where today's Turkey Trot turned into turkey terror. What exactly happened in there today? I assure you it wasn't that bad, really. I mean, people overreacted, that's all. Those birds went crazy, man! They tried to k*ll us! (grunting) Hey! That man is clearly insane. You saw his outfit! So, you closed the gates to keep the birds in? That's right. Their wings are clipped. Mm-hmm. That means that they're contained. But what about the people? Was anyone left inside? No, that would be a PR nightmare. Which we are not having today. No, thank you. No, today was nothing less than a total success. There's your headline! Yes. Write that down. We're on live television. Then make it into a graphic. A fun one that spins in. (whooshing) Total success! Yeah. We'll get right on that. Okay. Well, that went well. Yes. I think it did, too. Should we go home for dinner? Yes, I am starving. Yeah. Did everyone get out, by the way? Uh... no. No, no. Ooh. I mean, they were screaming when I closed the gates, so I don't think so. (laughs) But who's gonna believe them, right? Oh, ooh, we're still recording! Oh, dear Lord! Well, look at that. Yep. Happened twice now. Oh... well. Look at 'em. Where'd they come from, poultry prison? Yeah, this is bad. Their pecking order's all messed up. What? "Pecking order"? What are you talking about? Every turkey group has one guy who can peck everyone, then the guy below him who can peck everyone except for the top guy, and so on until the sad sack who can't peck anyone. Oh, that's terrible... it's like the ladies on The View. Yeah, with all these birds and people mixed in, they don't know what to do. They're pecking everything! It's chaos! Well, we still got to go find the kids. Let's just tiptoe past them. Ready? Teddy: Ready. (both yelling, turkeys gobbling) Run! (both grunting, panting) It's him... Cyclops! That's the one who knocked you down earlier. Oh, God, he hates me! (gasps) Oh, my God! I know what's happening! What? We rejected Thanksgiving and now it's attacking us! That's crazy, Lin... these turkeys are just all mixed up. They were keeping them with other birds. It's biology, not hocus pocus. Oh, I love that movie! Oh, how are we ever gonna find the kids? Mickey (over P.A.): They're on the Scramble Pan. Oh, my God! The birds have learned to talk! Mickey: No, no! It's me, Mickey. Mickey? Mickey?! The kids are on the Scramble Pan? What? I-I can't hear you. I said the... Turn on your microphone. What? Here. (amplified over P.A.): Uh, da.... My kids are on the Scramble Pan? Yeah, I, uh, saw them. As I was leaving them there, and, uh, running over here to hide. You abandoned my kids? Eh... sort of. But, uh, you know, they're safer on the ride, so I kind of did the right thing, if-if you think about it! (gobbling, squawking) Oh, man. You can only eat an animal for so long. It's the turkeys time to rule the Earth now. We had our chance and we blew it. No, it's the pecking order! It's the spirit of Thanksgiving! That's crazy talk! Don't call me crazy. That's not crazy talk. Guys, guys, guys, guys! I didn't say you were crazy. We got to stop fighting! We're turning on each other. This is exactly what they want! We gotta get the kids, Mickey. You gotta come with us. We need your help to turn off the ride. I would love to do that, Linda. But I'm actually really comfortable here, hiding in these stuffed animals. I just feel safe with these guys, I'm sorry. That looks nice. Oh! That gives me an idea! Mickey, we're coming over! Hey, daytime whiskey. Want to meet my CD collection? I feel like you guys would hit it off. Donna Summer? It's Summer time. (slow, sultry pop intro plays) Donna Summer:  Dim all the lights, sweet darling  'Cause tonight it's all the way  Hey, baby  Turn up the old Victrola  Gonna dance the night away...  Gene, Tina, Louise! Hey, wait, is that Mom? Yes! She said my name first! Mom! Help! All right, Mickey, turn it off. Can do. Oh, sh**t... I threw the key into the ocean. You what? I didn't want the birds to get it. We can't let this technology fall into their hands. Is there another way to turn it off? Wait! There's a drunk operator override switch on the ride! What?! Mickey: All the rides in the park have them. In case the operator gets drunk and goes on the ride, leaving no one to turn it off. Oh, smart. Okay, here I go. Just like turning off a bicycle. Oh, God, I'm gonna barf. Guys, I can do this. Oh, God. So dizzy. Oh, God, this is bad. Aah... So nauseous! Whoa... Seriously?! We've been on this thing for a freaking hour, and no one's barfed. Gene even had a snack. Looks like it's up to Mama. (Linda retches) Holy moly, this thing cannot be safe for children. But you adults seem to be doing really well with it! If only I had something to throw at the switch. Oh, my God. My water babies. (gags) Good-bye, baby bottle. Little Karen. Linda: Okay, no problem. I-I got nine more. Okay, this is the last one. Little Timmy, you were always my favorite. Please let someone else do it. I can do it! (buzzes) Yay! Nice! Way to go, Rudy! Rudy... one, asthma... zer... (gasps) Are you okay, my babies? Yep, I'm probably always gonna move in little circles like this, though. Uh-oh. Looks like we've got company. Bad company. And not the band! Probably. (gobbling, squawking) (siren wailing) Everyone relax, we're here. Those birds are crazy... look what one of them did to my nightstick. Please step aside. Let us take care of this, all right? Who's in control? Animal Control! Animal Control! Open 'em up! (screaming) Donna Summers:  It's all the way  Bob (singing along):  Oh, baby  Turn on that old Victrola  Gonna dance the night... it's so bright   Okay, here we go!    (siren whoops) Linda: Oh, God, we're surrounded. Regular sized Rudy: Who wants to be in charge of my epi-pen? I'm allergic to geese and ducks! I will not invite you to my duck-duck-goose party, then. Understood. (whooping, hollering) Linda: Teddy, what are you doing? I'm whooping and hollering. This is how I used to get the turkeys to follow me on the farm. (whoops) Save yourselves. (hollers) Honor my memory, Linda! Remember my name! Teddy! Don't try to stop me, Louise. I just remembered your name, it's Teddy! Right. I'll never forget his incredible legs. They looked like hotdogs. We have to get to the front gate. Help must be there by now. Whew! Great dancing, Bob. Time to reward myself with some beer. Oh, hello, uh, turkey baster. How-how-how are you? Good, good. Uh, yeah, good. I-I-I'm doing really good. Yeah. That's funny, I was just, uh... I was, I was... just talking about you. Uh, well, uh... It was good to see you. I-I should get back to... Yeah, it was... (chuckles) It was nice to see you. You look great. (grunts) What? I-I... I-I-I see you, okay? You-You've made your point. Fine. (chuckles) Is this what you want? A-Are you happy now? Yeah, yeah? That good? Do you want it to come out? You want to do this right now? You want to do this right now? That's a cl... that's classic. That's classic you, turkey baster! Classic you. Not fitting in the drawer. Deliberately not! (laughs) That's great. Oh, come on. Don't look at me like that, turkey baster. Don't look at me like that. I... I didn't want this! You think I wanted this?! But I didn't! I didn't. This isn't what I wanted. I-I never wanted to be apart from you. It was all an act. It was... it was a lie. (sniffles) Oh, God. That's so much snot. (sniffles) You know what? I'm gonna do it. You're right, turkey baster. I'm Bob. I make dinner. It's not too late. The grocery store's open for another hour. We can still do this! Let's go! Let's go! Get up! Get... I can't get... Oh, my God! I... (straining) Let's get up, drunk! I am dizzy! I'm really dizzy. Oh, my God. I gotta sit down. Give us... give us a minute. Cop: Please remain indoors. (siren whooping) I repeat, there's been a poultry-based disturbance. Please remain indoors. Poultry! Oh, come on! Everyone, get behind there. (moans) There's no one here. No one came for us. (moans) No one even cared. (moans) We're all gonna die here. We're all gonna die. (gibbers) I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you. Well, I've decided to go join the birds. I eat lots of bread already, and I'm tired of fighting. Good-bye. I'll miss you, but I understand. (motor rumbles) What is that? I know that sound. Wait a minute... It can't be. It is. The old Tickle Boat. I hope you guys aren't ticklish. Because of the boat... Tickle Boat. Son of a b1tch. I was thinking of that line the whole way here. Pretty good, right? Pretty good. Hey, can we get in? Linda: We're coming, Bobby. (chickens clucking) "Went to store real quick. Love forever, Bob." That's a perfectly good note. That doesn't sound drunk at all. Linda: We're almost there. Hey, look... I'm giving those birds the bird. (laughs) Mom, Mom, can we do it, too? Uh, yes. Just today, 'cause it's a holiday. Like this. (grunts) (cheering) Linda: Up, up, higher, higher. Whoa... Louise: Oh, I feel it. It's so insulting. Never do that again. (humming casually) (turkeys gobbling) This is fun, the two of us. We should go on more walks. (horn honking) Happy Thanksgiving... friendly guy. (man shouting) Hey, careful. I think that guy was drunk. Hello? Huh, that's weird. Okay, just gotta grab every single thing for dinner. That's no problem. (turkeys gobbling in distance) Bye, Andy. Bye, Ollie. Happy Thanksgiving. Go, go, go, go, go! I'm thankful that you saved Ollie's life. I'm thankful you saved Andy's life. Now, get out of here! Linda: Bob? Bobby, we're home! We're sorry! We didn't mean to leave you all alone on such a big... Tina: Dad? If you're hiding, that's fun. He's not hiding. Aw, giblets. We're going to get Daddy at the store. Rudy, honey, are you sure you don't want us to drop you off at home? I'm going with you. I kind of want to see how this one ends. (inhales) Oh, sweet Rudy. You probably won't live to see the end. Oh. There you are. The one that almost got away. Hello. Oh, whoa. You're an actual turkey. That's standing there. And you have only one eye. Not that that's bad. He-he was like this when I found him. 'Cause it's a grocery store. W-What are you doing here? (whispering): Okay, everyone follow me. (Tina moans nervously) (Bob screaming) Dad! Run! Run! Oh, my God, it's Cyclops! (Teddy shuddering) What the hell is happening?! We didn't do Thanksgiving right, and we didn't listen to you, and now Thanksgiving's attacking us! That makes sense. No, it's biological! No it's the beginning of a turkey revolution, Bob. We got to pick sides. Ow! He pecked me! Holy crap, that hurts. (nervous moaning) Oh, God. The final "peckoning." Pecked! That's it... pecked. I think Teddy was right! I was? And I know what to do. You do? Teddy was right?! (grunts) Ow! Lin, what are you doing?! I'm getting to the top of the pecking order. Linda, you're a genius. Right? Ow! Damn it. Son of a b1tch. Ow. Oh! Aah! (yells, grunts) Whoa, did that actually work? Stand back, let's see. (gasps) I'm the alpha turkey. Yeah, that's what I thought. Go stuff each other. To the Tickle Boat! Wait, the Tickle Boat that k*lled that guy? Yeah. Let's go. Go, go, go, go. Come on, go. All right. Move, move, move, out, out, go, go, go. Bob: Well, everyone,  here's to us. We've been through so much in the last... here's to us. Wait, stop, wait, wait. Uh-huh. I want to say: Here is to Bob on his favorite day. Bob! Yes! Louise: Bob...! Yay, great. Yes! Thank you. Yes! And here's to Linda, queen of the turkeys. She really knows how to peck people. Yay! Aw... Hear, hear. Queen of the Peckers. Aw... Nice. And speaking of turkey... who wants some? Wait, no one wants turkey? Not so much. I just don't think it's appropriate. Probably never ever again. I can still smell 'em, Bob. They're inside my mind nose. I'll make spaghetti. Yeah! I can't have pasta, but I'll eat a bowl of sauce. I'll make sauce. Fine, I'm putting on Donna Summer, though. Who's Donna Summer? Oh, Rudy, you are gonna love her. Mmm. Mmm. Well, Felix, should we do the wishbone? Yes, I guess we shou... (clattering) What was that? What was what? Come do the wishbone. Come, come on. No, no, no. I heard something outside. You didn't hear that? What was that? Come... I wish you would come do the wishbone. All right... I guess I win. (screaming)  There's been a change  Inside my life  And I just wanna let you know  I've got my finger on the trigger  Love is in control  Yeah, ho!  I've got my finger on the trigger  I ain't lettin' go  Mama used to tell me  Girl, you better load your g*n up right  She said, "You, you gotta come out smokin'  Hit it with your best sh*t every time... 
(over P.A.): I want to give a big Chuck Charles thanks to all you little people for coming down to this year's Wharf It Down Food Festival, which, for so many years, has been a strange, slightly sad event, where artisans try to sell specialty foods. But... not this year, thanks to me, Chuck Charles, and our 1st Annual Best Burger Contest! (applause, cheering) Chuck: Now, we've met our contestants, we've explained the rules of this really, truly, simple event. But the only thing we haven't done is start the clock. Here we go... (bell dings) (applause, cheering) All right, Bob. Let's do it, let's win! Win! Win! Win! Lin, please, Let's go! take it down a notch, okay? Or five? Kids, come on, cheer for your father. Cheer! Cheer! Cheer! Lin, stop. Cheer. Dad, big smile, big energy! That's it, doll. Hey, you're sweating too much already, buddy. Pace yourself. Go, Mom and Dad! I mean, stay there and cook, don't go anywhere. Sorry if I'm being confusing. Okay, come on. Go! Cook! Cook! Cook! Cook! (guffaws): Let's check in with our contestants. Skip Marooch! Uh, am I saying that right? (lisping): Yes, Skip. Great! So, you're from Pakistan, you've got a successful restaurant, you're on a book tour. Guy, what can't you do? Complain... everything is going so well. (guffaws) This guy. (chuckles) So, what are you making today? I already love you. Well, today, I will be making a pomegranate and green chili chutney burger with my grandmother's special spice blend. Two words: Yum and yum. She always told me, "Put spice on everything." She also said, "I hate Mondays," but she never got credit for that. (guffawing) (chuckling) I would love to meet her. Ah, too late. Oh. Sheesh. I know we're here for Bob, but it's hard to root against that guy. He is likeable. Shush! I can't hear them cooking. Skip Marooch... I can't believe we're competing against that guy. He has a book; I read it. I mean, I mostly read it. I looked at all the pictures. (sighs) Uh, why did I think this was a good idea? Bob (slurring): You know what? I'm signing up. We're doing it! Do it! We're doing it! This feels good! Do it! Louise (screaming): Quiet! I don't know what kind of "doing it" you're talking about, but you're too loud! (singsongy): Sorry... (burps) (sighs) I really hate contests. This is why we made a "no signing up for things while drunk" rule. Wha...? Gene never would've taken ballet. Look at Skip over there. I-I don't think we can win this. It's-it's like I'm Rocky and he's Apollo Creed. That's good! Rocky always won. Rocky lost in the first movie, Lin. Oh... But he walked up all those stairs. That's not fair. And... let's get a few words with Bob "The Slob" Belcher. Hi. That's not my nickname. Well, it is now, everyone heard it. Bob and I have a bit of a history, folks. I graciously allowed him onto my morning talk show, and in turn, he got me fired! I didn't get you fired. Linda did. Hi, Chuck. So, what stupid burger are you making, Bob? Okay, well, it's not stupid; It's smart. I call it the Bet it All on Black Garlic Burger. It's made with... Stupid name. What? Stupid name. (chuckles): It's not... Oh, my God. I-It's made with black garlic. Uh... it's a fermented garlic; It comes from Korea. Don't blame Korea for your stupid burger, Bob. Not fair to them or burgers. I-I'm not blaming them... The Stupid Black Garlic Burger. Put it up on the screen. Oh, my God. Eh, we made it up. Look, we're on the screen. (quietly): Chuck hates us. No... It's okay, I hate him, too. God, this was a bad idea. No... It's fun. It's fun... Over here, we have the Prince of Pizza trying to become the Chancellor of Cheeseburgers... Jimmy Pesto. Thank you, Chuck. (laughs) Uh, Jimmy Pesto's is known for our family-friendly atmosphere, festive drink specials and ltalian-flavored foods. All right... A-A-And after I win this contest today, we're also gonna be known for our Oregano Burger! All... right! (chuckles): And what's in that? Just a ton of oregano. The Big O! Don't say "Big O." What...? A... all right, I won't say anything, then, ever. Sounds horrible. I guess it's just us and Skip here. (sighs) All right, time to break out the black garlic. Lin? You got it! It's not in here. Wait. What? Not in the cooler. It's empty. Oh, crap. Oh, crap. Oh, crap. Oh, crap, crap, crap. Crap! Gene, can you go to the kitchen and grab the black garlic? On it! What color is it? It's black, Gene. Yup. Wait. What's black? The garlic. On the counter. In the kitchen? Where I am? Are you?! I think so. Well, then, yes, on the counter. Okay. I feel really good about this, Dad. I feel great about it. Way to go, everybody. Gene! Dad?! What are we doing? I asked Gene to get the black garlic from the kitchen... the single most important ingredient in my recipe... and we're looking at an empty cooler! Okay, don't freak out. Hi. Hi, everyone. (groans) (laughing): Hi. Hi. Hello. I'm not freaking out! (laughing): He's fine. He's... he's silly. Just put something else on the burger. What about a... Oh, a-a granola bar burger! Half a granola bar burger. Yeah, yeah, let-let's do that. That's a great idea. Great! I'll start chopping it up. Ha, ha, ha! Oh, it's old. Oh, that's okay. That's fine. We can make it. Linda. Oh, my God, I wasn't serious. Look at the screen. It says "Stupid Black Garlic Burger". I'm pretty sure we can't beat Skip Marooch if we don't have black garlic on our black garlic burger! Okay! Geez. Kids! Kids, come here! The answer is yes, you look terrified. Is that the question? Listen! Gene, what did you do with the black garlic? It's not in the cooler! Calm down, Dad. What is black garlic? Ugh! I need you guys to go back to the restaurant, get the black garlic and bring it back here as fast as you possibly can! No problem. It's on my way, anyway, bro. No, no! Tina, Louise, go with your brother. And hurry! The clock is ticking. Louise: Hmm. Let's talk more about this clock that's ticking. Tick, tick. What do want, Louise? Louise?! Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick... We never have to work again. You can have the day off tomorrow. Deal! Great. Here. Aah! Don't throw things! We don't throw things! We don't catch them, either. We're not in the circus, Dad. Yeah! Just go! Hey, Belcher boppers! Mickey! Wait, you drive a pedi-cab? I thought you worked at Wonder Wharf. Oh, I just started driving this during festivals and weekends. Make a lot of money hauling around lazies and drunks. We are both. Give us a ride! Hey, you kids don't want a ride from toothpick legs over here. Check out these pedal monsters, huh? (grunting) Wow. It looks like a bunch of snakes inside a leather armchair. Yup. Back off, Manny. This is my fare. Oh, yeah? Well this is my turf, rookie. Here. Hey! My first turf war! (grunts) (laughs) Whoa! Oh, hold on, let me... Okay, well, I-I think we'll go old-school pedestrian. See you guys! Good luck with your turf war. Thanks! Whoa! (grunts) So, Bob, you look sweaty. Think you have what it takes to beat the competition? I personally doubt it. I'm not sweating. Oh, I am. Okay. I, uh, I was just prepping. Normal, everything's fine. We've got all our ingredients, Chuck. All of 'em. Unnecessary information, totally boring. I'm gonna go ahead and talk to Skip. Hello! (laughing): There he is, guy! Tell us more about your grandmother's secret spice blend. All right, well, there is saffron in it. Oh, no, I told you the secret! I have to k*ll you now! Die, die, die! (chuckling) (laughter) Warm, charming, and funny, strong hands, to boot! That's why he's got a book and Bob doesn't. Oh. Ah, there you are, my stinky princess! We're getting you out of here! Come with us! Hey, there's my back-scratching spatula! What are you doing in the kitchen? Aah! Gene, you're crushing it! What? Oh, no! My shirt! Aah! You just cost Dad the competition! Forget Dad. You just cost us our day off! Maybe it's still good! I'll scrape it off with my back scratcher. Ooh, it works on your front, too. Mm. What's so hard to understand about, "I saw the black garlic, "but then I saw my spatula back scratcher, "and when I reached for it, your black garlic got smeared all over my belly"? Oh, my God. Gene, put Tina on the phone. She's pretty big. It'd be easier to put the phone on Tina. Gene! This is Tina. Tina, listen to me. Go to your mom's bra drawer and find the cash she thinks is secret. There's no money in there! There's no money. Take $20 and go to that specialty food market on Third. Uh, Fig Jam. Uh... aren't there any other places we could go? It's the only place in town that has black garlic. Hurry. We're down to 12 minutes here. Dad hung up on me, but it's okay because I know he loves me, and he says we have to go to Fig Jam. Fig Jam? Fig Jam. We'll take this dark chocolate bar with bacon and red pepper flakes, please. Okay, that'll be $13. All: What?! (laughing) No, we're just getting one, so this should cover it. Here you go. Mm. You know, I think you three may be in the wrong store. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable shopping at the gum ball machine at the gas station. Are you kicking us out? No. I am strongly suggesting that you take your business elsewhere, what little of it you have. Hmm. All right. But when a rich john sets me up in style, I'm coming back. And you better hope you don't work on commission. Yeah, where'd you import this chocolate from anyway, your butt? No. Yeah, and where'd you import these sea salt caramel crisps from, your butt? Oh, Belgium. That's it. You're banned. We ban you. Get out of the store! I will not get out of my store! You... get out! You are banned! You're banned! You're banned! You're banned! You're banned! You're banned! You're banned! We have to try, guys. If we don't get this black garlic, Dad is going to lose, and our family will be dishonored. It's not like we've got a whole bunch of honor to spare, is it? No. No. Let's go! CHUCK Oh, wow, Skip Marooch is cooking up something special. It smells good, and he looks good doing it. Scratch that. He looks great. Thank you! Moving on. Let's see how Jimmy Pesto's doing. Done! Ding! Ooh, what? Wow, Jimmy has plated his burgers with ten minutes left. (laughs) Course, those burgers may get cold before the judges have a chance to... Ah! Da-da-da. Oh, okay, brought a little heat lamp with him. Yeah. Heat lamp adds a little flavor. And it keeps my lizard warm! Would you?! Come on! Let's check in on Bob, because we kind of have to. Lots of chopping. His bald spot's getting bigger and shinier. Hair probably falling out all over his food. What a disgusting creature. I'm catching all the hair before it even comes close to the food. God, it is coming out. Your wife is a lucky woman, Bob. Thank you! Maybe he won't recognize us. Banned! Whoa, hey, come on. Let's not do this again. Let's start fresh. What'd you say your name was? I didn't. It's none of your business. Hey, don't look at my nametag. It's Ray. I saw it. Aw, Ray, I love that. Ray of sunshine. Ray of hope. We need some emergency black garlic; It's a black garlic emergency. Oh... a black garlic emergency. Yeah, so... Well, in that case... No! A "no" is just a "yes" upside-down. Get out. We'll pay double. Really? Yes. All right, $16. Aw, that's the ray of greed I remember. Gene, where's the cash? We got to go. Come on, we got to go. A cool older kid with a skateboard asked me for a dollar. So, I gave him the $20 and he's skating right back with the change. Ugh! Gene, you fool. He's not coming back. Never trust a boy with a skateboard. They're too fast. Hey, Ray, friend, uh, new plan: I'm gonna give you Gene, and then I'll take... Out now. Banned. Banned! Psst. Psst. Time for Operation Black Garlic Down Freedom. What's that? (Louise and Tina screaming) Hey! We'll come back and pay for it later! Gene: Thanks for all your help, Ray! Get back here! (all grunting) (grunting)   (continue grunting) Mickey! Hey, kids! Hey. Hi, Ron. Hey, move over, buddy. (grunting) Aw, sorry, gang, I'm kind of in the middle of a fair here. I was going to the library. Taking a pedi-cab there is my weekly splurge. But we stole something. Oh, why didn't you say so? Where to? Take us to the food festival and step on it! (groans) (bicycle bell rings) Stop! Ho, ho, ho there, cowboy. I will give you 20 bucks if you catch up to that pedi-cab. Wait, what? You mean that spaghetti-legged fare thief? Uh... yes. Oh. Oh, baby. Mickey, you are going down. Okay. (whoops) Let's get 'em! Whoa! Let me hold the black garlic. I want to apologize for murdering its brother. No, Gene. I don't think that's a good idea. Yeah, we're trying to get a day off here. Wait, why can't I hold the black garlic? It's just that you always... I don't want to say "screw everything up," but maybe Louise does? You screw everything up! Wait, me? This Gene Belcher? It's just sometimes you lose focus. Your name is a verb in this family, Gene. We call it "Gene-ing out." I thought that meant taking off your shorts after a good meal. No. I was Gene-ing out at work the other day. I'm Gene-ing out right now. (shouting) Mickey, no! Mickey, hey! You're taking us to the food festival as fast you can! Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right, right. (grunting) Oh, my God. I'm a verb. I'm a bad verb. You're a berb. I'm a berb! Eight minutes left until burger judgment day! The kids should've been back by now. We're screwed. Bob, you said you were Rocky. Come on. Start acting like Rocky. Scream "Adrian." I-I don't want to scream "Adrian." Scream "Adrian"! Linda, that analogy doesn't work anymore. Rocky's son didn't leave Rocky's boxing gloves at home. Yeah. Rocky's son, huh? Hmm. Well, maybe... Eh, forget it. No, what? Wh-What were you gonna say? I'm just saying, you picked our least responsible kid to do the most important thing. Maybe you kind of expected him to screw up. (scoffs) That is ridiculous, Lin. Well... forgetting the black garlic sort of lets you off the hook for losing. Like it's not your fault. All of a sudden, you got a built-in excuse for not being the best. That is crazy. That's... maybe right? Oh, my God. (phone vibrates) Oh, it's the kids! "Got garlic. Broke law. You fix later. On our way. 'Smiley face.'" Aw, smiley face! Oh, my God. They got it. They're coming. We're gonna have everything we need. No more excuses. No. I'm terrified. So I was ri... Linda, you were right. Yes! Right! Me! (laughs) Aw, you don't have to say that. (yelling) TINA: It's Ray, and he's either getting bigger or closer. Uh-oh, he's got Manny driving him. Don't worry, I'll slow him down. (grunts) (yelling) Oh, that was overdue. Why did I do that? Eh, they're throwing stuff at us. Ah, no throwsies, man! Yeah! No throwsies. We got to get this to dad. Go. Go. Get him. Faster. Faster. I am going! I just want you kids to know, I will fight. I will fight Manny or Ray, but I-I prefer to fight Ray, actually, 'cause he's smaller. Nice. Thanks, Ron. Ah, no problem. There's the contest! (train whistle blows) Mickey, pedal harder. Mow these people down! Tina: Oh, no, a train! Beat it, Mickey! Beat it. Ah, damn it! No...! (panting) Sorry, kids. You're gonna have to run from here. You guys stay here and block. I'll cut through the crowd like a fart through butter. Let me take the garlic. I need this. This is my redemption song. Bob Marley, give me strength! This is a food festival, Gene. It's a distraction minefield for you. Yeah, Gene. Stay here and help me block Ray. It'll be a block party. Okay. Hey, look, that cloud looks like a dinosaur on a thing. Where? Huh? (Gene panting) Aah! I can't believe it! Gene made us Gene out! Oh, yeah, I see it. Okay, Gene. Get this black garlic to dad. Don't lose focus. Ooh, muffins. No, don't lose focus! Hi. I'm Ron. I'm blocking you. Where are those kids? Tina: Oh, you mean us? Meet your new cankles, Ray. Hi. Where's the black garlic? You'll never get it. It's too far away, and as we've already said, you're cankled. Don't you cankle me! These are good. These are gonna be good. Linda, be my eyes. You see the kids out there? No, I don't. What do they look like? Oh, God. I'm panicking. I'm panicking. (panting) Free cupcake-flavored ice cream, served on a waffle! You're k*ll*ing me! Pizza tacos. Pizza tacos? Ten for one dollar. Don't you tell me "ten for one dollar." (chain saw buzzing) (screams) Robot cake, release your hold on me! So, uh, you work at Fig Jam, huh? I-I-I heard you had great fig jam. Oh, yes, it's delicious. And you'll never know, because you're banned! Aw. Hey, wait a minute. Is anyone even watching Fig Jam right now? Ray, people are probably looting it. A bunch of hippies stuffing truffled cheese in their banjo cases. (shouting): Hello? Hello...? I'm just gonna leave money on the counter. Love your store. Oh, my God. Fig Jam! Fig Jam! That was some mean pedi-cabbing out there, rookie. You got the legs of a mouse but the heart of a lion. My uncle's got the heart of a lion. He got it in Thailand. Thailand, huh? Yeah. They got nice ties in Thailand? I love you, Manny. (panting) I'm almost there. Hot Fudge Car Wash. (in slow motion): Hot Fudge Car Wash?! No...! (maniacally crying) Oh, it's Gene. Bob, it's Gene. Dad...! Gene! I-I'm sorry I screwed up today! I... (grunts) I'm sorry I screw up all the time! No, Gene, you didn't screw up. I screwed up by trusting you. Wait, that came out wrong. I'm confused, are you trying to make me feel better? Yes, I am. Before I give you the black garlic, I just want to say one more thing. There's only 45 seconds left, Gene, so... I've always admired you. Just give me the garlic, Gene! We'll talk later! Okay. Thank you. Sorry I snapped. Come on, Bobby. You got your gloves, now time to beat Apollo. Adrian...! No, not like that. Say it right. What?! I'm saying it right. Adri... I don't have time, Lin. Ten seconds left. Some cooks look like they might not make it. I'm talking about Bob. Crowd: Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. I got everything ready. Here we go. Crowd: Six. Five. (in slow motion): Four. Three. Two. One. (alarm buzzes) Time's up. Hand off your meat, chefs. We finished! We finished the burgers! Hooray for Bob. He managed to somehow do what he does every day for a living. What a champion. That's my Bobby! Chefs. Pre... sent your burgers to the judges. Looks like the judges are tasting Jimmy Pesto's burger first. Let's see how he... oh, oh, they are spitting it out. Oh, it's cool. (grunts) Hey, two-for-one pizza night Wednesdays, karaoke Tuesdays, trivia Thursdays. We never card. Come on down! Thank you, Jimmy. Spitting it out... bad sign. You can probably go. Ah... come on, Trev. (groans) Hey, I'm sorry I was so hard on you. Things got a little heated. And not just 'cause of your heat lamp. Ah... you said "hard." I did. Up top. (grunts) All right, now they're tasting Bob's idiot burger. Get ready for another spit-out. This is... fantastic. The meat is seasoned perfectly, and this black garlic is... Oh! Oh... This has exquisite mouth feel. Bobby, they loved it! That one's creepy, but he loved it. Oh, my God. Did we just win? I mean, they still haven't had Skip's burger, but... Chuck: And now the last, but most likely the best, from the Cinnamon Stallion, Skip Marooch. This is... amazing. This chutney is absolutely, mmm, oh... Exceptional mouth feel. Hmm. It might be a little closer than I thought. Okay. Okay, Bob. You got a "fantastic" and an "ooh," but he got an "amazing" and a really weird moan. And he liked both your mouth feels. I'd say it's a tight race. Chuck: And now the judges will deliberate. Cue deliberating music, please. You know what? I did my best, I held my own with Skip, and no matter what happens, Lin, I feel pretty good. Chuck: And the winner is Skip Marooch! (bell dings) Oh, my God, I feel bad. Oh-oh. Ah, damn it! Piece of garbage! How could we lose?! Are you kidding me?! Okay. Okay. Ah, it's shaped like a burger! I get it! I'm so excited! (singsongy): Skip Marooch, handsomest chef. What about me? Great emcee. Gonna go have a plate of shrimp, a 20-ounce beer and a massage, from my friend, Hank the masseuse... Oh, my God. Gene: Sorry you lost, Dad. Maybe if I'd gotten you the black garlic sooner, you would have won. No, no. We made the best burger we could, but we lost, and that's okay. I don't need an excuse. I guess Skip was just more charismatic and likeable, Dad. That's right. No! I don't need an excuse. Either way, I'm sorry. Listen, Gene. You may get distracted from time to time, but I love you and I love who you are. And what matters most is... Gene? Gene, are you listening?! I am. I am. I love you. I love you, too. But what are those people doing waiting in front of the restaurant? Bob: Hmm. People don't wait for our restaurant. Maybe they all need to use the bathroom. Hey, get out of here! Go pee in the bushes like normal people. Are you guys open? We want to try that black garlic burger. Can I have a black garlic burger, too? (laughs) Skip? What the hell? Yeah. You want to try my burger? Yeah, I smelt it, and now I want you to dealt it. Into my mouth. Come on in. W-We just need a few minutes to get the grill going. Gene, you want to go start the grill? Nope. My day off starts now. And I will be spending the next 24 hours at the Hot Fudge Car Wash. Bye-bye. Oh. Gene! Yeah? Did you just say "Hot Fudge Car Wash"? I did. My day off starts now, too. Bye-bye. Whoa, whoa, wait. We have customers. Sorry, Dad. I have to go see a car wash about a fudge. Get Mommy a to-go bucket.

Young Bob (falsetto): Hey, Bob. Thanks for cooking me. You're pretty good with that spatula; How old are you? (normal voice): 14. (falsetto): Oh, wow, you're like a prodigy. (normal voice): Yeah, I'm pretty good, I guess. (falsetto, laughing): That tickles, I like it. Here you go, Henry. What's this? I ordered the usual. Well, well, since Pop's getting his prostate checked, and I'm manning the grill, I thought, why not try the unusual? Ooh. Henry, I present to you "Baby You Can Chive My Car Burger." Sour cream, chives, and little fried pickle wheels on the sides that make it look like a car. Vroom, vroom! You know he's a grown man, right? Someone's having fun at work today. Yep, a lot. I came up with a bunch of ideas for specials. The Crispy Brinkley Burger, the Richard Per-Simmons Burger, the Greed is Gouda Burger... Easy, easy, whew. Okay, okay. Pete: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Sorry, I got excited. I-I'm just passionate. (door opens) So that's what a prostate exam is. (shudders) Did you guys know what it was? I think it's more fun if it's a surprise. Hey, Big Bob, look what Little Bob made. Junior, what is this? It's a "Baby You Can Chive My Car Burger." A what you can what my what burger? Henry, did you order this? What'd you order? The usual, but this looks okay. I-I like cars. Try it, Henry, y-you might like it. Don't tell him what to eat, Junior. He didn't order that, he's a tuna melt man... look at him. I-I'll take a bite. I'll eat the wheel. Hey, hey, hey, hey, it's my burger-car. Get off. It's nobody's burger-car. We'll make you a tuna melt. Just everybody shush! That's the last time I get my prostate checked. Linda: Wrap it up, Teddy. We got to close up. We're going to Big Bob's Christmas Eve party. Ugh, Teddy, eat slower. Actually, that's too slow. Dear Lord Santa, this year, please bless me with a calendar of Australian firefighters holding puppies in casual settings. And bless me with a perm. You only live once; Why not have a little fun up top? And, Santa, bless me with an internship at your company. Preferably something in the flying animal or breaking and entering department, thank you. Kids, I know it's Christmas Eve but I don't think you pray to Santa. Lord Santa, strike him down! Ooh, that reminds me. I'm supposed to go to midnight mass tonight. Either that or midnight basketball. I've got my shorts in the truck. What do you think I should do? Combine them... mass-ketball! All right, let's go. Big Bob's Christmas party, here we come. I don't want to go. Plus, is it a party if my dad just works the whole time and charges people? Isn't that just being a restaurant? It's Christmas, he invites us every year, we're going. But we just went two years ago. That was seven years ago. You sure? I remember. I was still breast-feeding. No, you weren't. Not with you. Fine, we'll go, but we're sticking to the 15-minute rule. What? What are you talking about? It-It's that I can only be around my dad for 15 minutes. Then I have to leave before I completely lose it. Well, good luck. (timer dings) I give it three months. I'm gonna go inside. (timer dings) You're a lot fatter than I was at your age. Gotta go. Aw, cute kid. (kissing) (timer dings) So you named him Gene, huh? Is it too late to change that? I'm gonna leave now. But this is your house. That's okay. Yep, so now Dad only sees Grandpa in 15-minute intervals. It's like speed dating but with your dad. Hey, father issues... we all got 'em. I've got mother issues, too. I've even got cousin issues. Beautiful blonde cousin issues. Aw... Ew. What? Oh, forget your 15-minute rule. Tonight's the night you and your dad finally patch everything up. Because of  Christmas magic  Christmas magic  This time of year  Okay, stop, stop. Teddy:  This time of year  Stop, stop, Teddy.  And all the cold hungry people  All those cold hungry people  They're dying in the streets  They're dying in the streets  Me and my family will be warm tonight.  Okay, Lin. Anyway, the rest of us get along great with Pop Pop. I enjoy his opinions on what's ruining America. You know what you should do? You should ask him for $5. He'll give it to you... in cash. Okay, fine, fine. We're... w-we'll go to Grandpa's. But we're only going for 15 minutes. Teddy, have fun at church. Or basketball. Either way, I'm wearing shorts.  Fa-la-la-la, la-la-la-la  Oh, it's Christmastime again...  (quietly): Guys, guys, did you get presents for Mom and Dad? I got Mom that hip-hop yoga video she wanted. I went in on it. Tina, how much do I owe you? Just kidding, it's on you. Great, that'll be from all of us. So what did we get Dad, Tina? (gasps) I didn't get him anything. Oh, way to go, T. Gene and I are pulling our weight. Yeah, Tina. Sorry, it's just been a crazy season. Well, we can't put "sorry" under the tree, can we? We'll just give him whatever's in my pocket. A chocolate-covered raisin. Scratch that. A raisin. Crap, this happens every year. Well, we're gonna have to make him a gift at Grandpa's. Mm. There it is. Our restaurant's dad. Hey, look who's here. Hey, Pete. Merry Christmas, Bob and family. Merry Christmas, Pete! You haven't been here in so long, I grew a big white beard. Just kidding, it's a Santa beard. This is my real beard. Keep going! Russian nesting beards! How's your bar? Pete owns the bar next door, remember? Is it still gay, still going strong? Stronger and gayer than ever. That's our motto.  Stronger and gayer than ever!  I just wrote a jingle for you. Hmm. Ha! She's pretty "singy" tonight.  Yeah.  Hey, Big Bob's in the back, and I think it's hug o'clock. Huh, kids? I get it. We're coming for you, Pop Pop. Here you go. Merry Christmas, Big Bob. Linda, kids. Boy, you get smaller every year. When do I stop calling you Big Bob and start calling you Old Wrinkly Shriveled-Up Bob? Ha! All right, all right. Sorry. And how are my grandkids doing? I got problems, but nothing five dollars wouldn't fix. (clears throat) Grandpa, you don't look a day over grandpa age. You're a doll, Tina. Thank you. Hey, look what I got here. Who's your favorite president? Bill Pullman! "Today we fight for our independence!" Here you go. Oh. Merry Christmas. Thanks, Gramps. Hey, listen. We have an arts and crafts emergency. We need glue, we need paper, we need pasta. We need it, like, yesterday. How many sizes of googly-eyes do you have? I don't really have any of that. But I've got a bunch of crap down in the basement if you kids want to take a look. One man's trash is another man's present for their father. Hey, Junior. How are things? Eh, my prep guy's gone tonight. Went to the hospital 'cause his daughter's having a baby. People can be pretty selfish, I guess. (scoffs) Jerk baby. Linda. Uh, h-hold on here. Bobby, this is going well. Yeah, check back with me in 14-and-a-half minutes. (whispering): Christmas magic. Stop saying that. No, I don't want to. You sure look slammed tonight, Big Bob. Seems like you could use a hand. If only there was someone here... Lin, no. Who knew their way around the kitchen... Stop. They knew the menu... Lin, no. Where to get the cheese... No. Knew where that goes. Stop. They knew their way around. Stop it. Like the back of their hand. Like they were raised here. No, no. I-I don't. Yeah, I doubt he'd... Bob could help cook. No, I-I don't... Ah? I'll get trapped in there... 15-minute rule. It's you father... Stop it. It's your father. Shut up. All right! You two bond, have fun! Big Bob: Okay, this is it. I'm gonna give Little Bob his Christmas gift. Everybody ready? Bob Junior! Wh-What's going on? Bobby, you've been working here your whole life. And I'm sure you've been waiting for this day. W-What are you doing? From this point forward, Big Bob's Diner will officially be called... Oh, Dad, don't. ...Bob and Son's. All right! Yeah! (cheering) The new menus. And... Okay, that's gonna say "Son's." It's not done yet, but it's great, huh? My cousin's painting it. He's slow, he can only do about a letter a day, but he can spell like a son of a b1tch. Like a son of a b1tch. Come here, partner. Uh... (mocking): Uh, uh... Come on, want to be partners, or what? No? (gasping) You're welcome. I think... Wait, what'd you just say? I said no. I could never be partners with you. You're impossible to work with. What? Oh, boy. Easy, Little Bob. I want to change the menu, a-and you never want to change the menu. And you're so critical. I can't even lift a spatula without you saying I'm doing it wrong. 'Cause you're doing it wrong! L-Let's let the spatula decide. You both call it, a-and we'll see who it goes to. I want to express myself in the kitchen! And when I say that, he makes this weird sound! (sighing scoff) That sound! What is that?! You're gonna do this? Right now? In front of everybody? You know what? Get out! Take your jokey burger specials and go! Fine! You just gave me a new burger idea. The I'm Sproutta Here Burger. Comes with sprouts. Ah, not that but something else. (sighing scoff) I thought of a better one! The "I'd Be Cheddar Off Literally Anywhere But Here Burger!" Comes with aged cheddar... forget it! Forget it! Merry freaking Christmas! Merry Christmas, Little Bob! Lin, this was not the plan. Me cooking with my father at the party was not the plan. We are radically off plan. Bob, calm down. Listen to me. This is a great opportunity for you two to turn your bad blood to glad blood. Here, Bob, have some Christmas magic, eh? Wait, Christmas magic is wine? It's whatever you want it to be. It can be snow or Santa or beer or gin or rum or schnapps. I-I get it. Listen, I've been with him for five minutes, so I'm setting this timer for ten minutes, and then I'm leaving. Well, I'm setting this timer to forever. 'Cause that's how long you and your father are gonna love each other. Talking about your heart, Bob, not your nipple. All right, pastrami with mustard, table three. Uh, w-where's the club sandwich for table two? Right here, Dad. I got a great idea, Big Bob. How about I run the food, that way you can stay in the kitchen and cook with Little Bob. No, no, I-I think Big Bob is fine running the food. That's... Look out, table two, here comes Linda with your club! (Bob sighs) Wait, where's table two? You order a club? Club? Club? Present for Dad, present for Dad, present for Dad. Ooh, cans of beans! (imitating drums) Dad loves to drum on beans, right? What about this chair? Dad sits sometimes. Ugh, boring. He'll sit when he's dead, Tina. What if we glue all these mousetraps together, and call it a super trap? (gasps) What if I make my chair a super chair? Like, if I tape this pad of paper to it, then he could journal. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Is this a little friendly competition we have here? A little Christmas competition? Whoever gives Dad the best present, wins a... A Mistle-Tony! Yes! The most coveted award in gift-giving! Dibs on bringing Mom to the ceremony! Dibs on bringing Dad. Dibs on bringing Dad. Nope, too late. So, who you bringing, Tina? I don't know now. Yeah. So, uh, th-the grill seems good. It's getting to be an antique. Yeah, we all are, you know? (chuckles) Yeah. It-It's a new hood? Five years ago. Good hood? Yeah, pretty good. Pretty good hood. Yeah, I-I got a good hood, too. Ah, that's good. You always said you need a good hood. I never said that. I thought you said that; I... that's... No one in the history of time has ever said that. "All you need is a good hood." I swear I remember you saying that all you need is a good... That wasn't me. It was someone else. I don't know why anyone else would say that. (ticking) Dad's chair is almost done. He'll never have to stand up again. Dad's thirsty; He's got a water bottle. He's cold; Box of matches. Now he's bored. Not anymore. Here's a basketball. And then I can use this dish towel to wipe the floor with you. Because I just won the Mistle-Tony. Um, when you see this trap, you're gonna want to shut yours. Period. End of burn. How's your present going, Little Drummer Gene? Beans, beans, the tragical fruit? The more you drum it, the more you lose? The contest? That we're in right now? Mm-hmm. Like the saying, about the beans, but with, uh, different words. Well, I was gonna empty out these cans to make a better drum sound, but now I think I might soak these old bones in a little bean bath! Gene, you're pulling out of the competition? No. I'm just taking a little siesta to clear my mind. Tina, be a dear and get me two slices of ham to put over my eyes? Hey, Dad, we're probably gonna head out in about, um, 30 seconds. So, just have to finish up this last order. What do you think this says? "Grilled cheese." Grilled cheese. Huh. That's weird. Wh... what? Nah. Nothing. Never mind. (timer dings) It just... it says "grilled cheese" on the ticket, but maybe you thought it said "burnt toast," I don't know. (high-pitched): Oh, my God. Okay, Dad. We're gonna hit the road. How we doing? Good. We're just learning how to make grilled cheese for the first time, for some reason. (high-pitched chuckle) (laughs) Oh, hey, look at me! I got a new order over here! Uh, Henry here at the counter says he wants "the usual."     (growls): "The usual." Uh... yeah? I'll take care of Henry's usual, Bob. You keep burning the grilled cheese. Oh, no, Dad, I'm gonna take care of this. I'm gonna take care of Henry. What are you talking about? I'm talking about the burger I tried to make him when I was 14 and you put me in charge of the restaurant. That's what I'm talking about! Wait, what burger? The Baby You Can Chive My Car Burger, Pop! (nervous laugh) Okay. Everyone's fine. Talking it out. Here we go! Let's see if he's got any chives. Probably not! Why would he have chives in a restaurant? That would be too much flavor! Oh, I've got chives, buddy. Good. You ready, Henry? What? Stay out of this, Henry! Sorry. You are not making one of your gimmick burgers in my kitchen! Vroom. Vroom. What is that? It's a car sound! That's not a car sound. This is a car sound. (imitates engine revving) (imitates brakes screeching) That's how you do it. Oh, my God! Al right, stop making that burguer right now! Henry wants the tuna melt! Isn't that right, Henry? No, Pop. Henry wants the Baby You Can Chive My Car Burger he never had a chance to taste because of you! Look, uh, I don't want to cause any trouble here. I'll just eat whatever you put in front of me. No problem, easy breezy. You're getting the tuna melt! You're getting the burger, Henry! Not if I make the tuna melt first! Good luck! (grunts) Hey, don't box me out. Hey, if you're having a hard time getting to the grill, it's not my problem. And... hug. No? Okay. Dad will never walk again. By choice. Nor will he love either of you again. By choice. Guys? Did you hear my trash talking? You can't hurt me, Tina. At this point, I'm more bean than Gene. Louise: Nobody talk! Nobody talk. I just need to get one more on here and... I win. I win. I win! Oh, you might have won if I was done, but I'm not. What could be better-y than a battery taped to the back of the chair? Game. Set. Match. (traps snapping, girls screaming) No! No! No! Uh-oh. Hope you're happy, Tina. Now Dad doesn't get a Christmas present. Looks like Dad just won a bean bath with a little pee in it! Oh, that's something. This'll make Dad's skin look 40 again... (screams) No! I spilled my beans! I guess the Mistle-Tonys were a bust. Tina, new game. You have ten seconds to find a gift for Dad. Go! Um... we could give him this snow globe? It says, "Oh, snow, you didn't." Attagirl. Wrap it up, make it look pretty. I'd give you this big, beautiful bow, but then what would I wear? (grunts) I threw away your garnish! Damn it! Order up! Order up! Lin, take this to Henry! No, Linda. Take this to Henry! I'm not taking anything anywhere until you two make peace! You know what you need? Come on, people! Sing! We can bring these guys back together!  Peace, peace, peace  Peace, peace...  Everybody!  Peace, peace...  Come on.  Peace, peace, pea...  Yeah!  Peace  Yeah, yeah... (Linda continues singing) Fine, I'll take it to Henry myself! Then I will, too! Get your foot out of my... (screams) Ow! Come on, it's Christmas! Here you go, Henry. The usual. Here you go, Henry. The "Baby You Can Chive My Car Burger."  Peace, peace...  All right, it's not working. Uh, they both look... good? You son of a b1tch. Take a bite. Eat the tuna melt, Henry. Could I just give the burger, um, a sniff? Henry... It's okay to smell. (sniffing) Oy gevalt. Henry... Smells good, right? Uh, maybe-maybe just a... a quick lick? No, not a lick. Don't do it. Don't lick. Come on. Get it all up in there, Henry. Don't do it, Henry. You know what? Maybe I won't. (sighs) I knew you wouldn't do it, Henry. Oh, my God, I have to! Henry! Oh... What? I'm not chewing. I'm just holding it in my mouth for a second. Ha! You see that, Pop? I'm sorry. Oh... Oh, no. I'm swallowing. Oh, it's so good. I'm having another bite. No! (laughs) I win! I win! Ha! How do you like my joke burgers now, Pop? Okay, Junior. You win. Thanks for coming to my party. Hey, everybody! I'm covered in bean juice! How about I run around and you all try to catch me like a pig at the state fair? Here I go. (panting) Try to catch me. No one's trying very hard! Good night, everyone. Merry Christmas. Well, he's out. More bean boy for the rest of you. (panting) Bob: What?! Why is everybody looking at me?! Bobby, easy, easy. Dad. Dad. Yes, Louise? Everyone looks like they're mad at you. Thank you. Maybe this will cheer you up, Dad. (sighs) Thanks, Tina. Open it. There's something inside. A snow globe. Yes. Great. Th... Wait, where'd you get this? Europe. No, the newspaper. Where-where did you find this? From Pop Pop's basement. It was in his desk. Look at him. He's like a baby, playing with the wrapping paper. Aw. Bobby, what is it? It's the first review of Bob's Burgers. My dad saved it. Oh, my God. That's beautiful. Read it. I don't think so. Read it. I don't want to read it. Read it! "Unique burgers. Good prices. "Service leaves something to be desired. But worth the trip." Hmm. Not great. I mean, it's okay. Oh, Bobby. He does love you, and you drove him out of his own restaurant. On Christmas. (sighs) Oh, my God. What did I do? I just told you. Oh. Right. Drive your father out on Christmas... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I heard. Oh, my God, that's so sad. So much for Christmas magic. (door opens) Pete: Put this on and come with me. (gasps) Wait, what? Your dad's in my bar. We're gonna go see him. Go, Bobby. Go. I-I... The kids and I will take care of the diner. Go. Yeah, Dad. When a mysterious cowboy/Santa says, "Come with me," you climb on that horse and ride. Also, free hat! (country music playing) Bob: I thought this was a disco. Pete: That's Wednesdays. Thursdays, we watch Scandal. Tonight's Country Western line dancing. And tomorrow's Christmas... or did you forget? I know. I know. Things got a little heated. There he is. Go talk to him. With the hat. Okay. Just leave me alone. Pop, come back to the diner. I'm busy. You're just sitting here. No, I'm not. I'm... I'm dancing. Da... dancing? You don't dance! (grunting) Whoa. Get out there, Bob Junior. Pop, will you please just come and talk to me? If you want to talk to your dad, you're gonna have to boot scoot to him. What does that mean? What's "boot scoot"? It looks like this. Hey-a! Bend... bend your knees. I'm-I'm... ow, okay. Now shake that pudding. What do you want? I just want to talk to you. You're doing it wrong. Those aren't the steps. Oh, my God. Really? This is why I didn't want to work with you. You have to control everything I do. My cooking, my dancing... Not everyone wants to dance exactly the same way. Okay, bad example. You guys are really good at this. I'm here every Friday night. And Thursdays. I love Scandal. Pop, are you...? I'm not gay, Bob. These guys are my friends. They eat at my diner; I come here and dance. Oh! Ah, damn, missed it again. Why'd you come over here, Bob? To miss steps? Look, Pops, you are who you are, and I realize now that I should just accept that. That's right. Be yourself, sister. I just wanted to say I'm sorry. Not for leaving. And not for starting my own restaurant. But just for how I handled things on the day we broke up. (dancers whoop) I know it was your way of showing love, it's just... I never felt like you were supportive of me. At least, that's what I thought until I found the review you saved. You found that, huh? The kids did. Not a good idea to let my kids into your basement, by the way. Gene took a bean bath. Well, at least somebody's having a good time tonight. Dad, I'm sorry. You didn't deserve to be embarrassed in front of your customers. I did it back then and I did it again tonight. Nope. Wrong time. Listen, I know why you had to go. I can be... not great to work with. It was tough without your mom around. You did great on your own. She'd be very proud. You really think... Okay, I'm the only guy facing this way now. So I'll turn around. Here we go. Gene, take this chicken noodle soup to table five. On it! Tina, clean up the spill by the bathroom. Bathroom spill is my middle name. Attagirl. Louise, grab some napkins for the kid at the counter. That kid's a mess! I know. Big Bob: Look at your family in there. They really can sling hash when they want to. They don't usually work this hard. You got happy kids. Weird, happy kids. That's nice. You're a good dad, Junior. Thanks, Pops. Let's go back inside, huh? Yeah, let's... (lock clicks) (laughing) Hey! Hey! Kids, let us in. Ha ha, no! Open it! This is our restaurant now! It's called Chez Restauranto, and we're Brazilian barbecue! Tina: Here. Aw, come on, Tina! Sorry. Linda: All right! Christmas magic! My Bobbies are back! Henry: Yay! (applause) Big Bob: Merry Christmas, everyone. Louise: Merry Christmas, Pop Pop!  Christmas magic  Christmas magic  Comes every time each year, whoo!  Christmas magic  And all the cold hungry people  Christmas magic  Fa-la-la-la-la  They're dying in the streets  That can't be good.  Christmas magic  Me and my family will be warm tonight  Aw, yeah, fa-la-la-la-la-la-la. 
55... Distinguished gray. 56... Undistinguished gray. Hey! Stop counting my gray hairs. We would count Dad's, but his hair is so fragile. No, it's not. Oh, my God, a clump. Mom, can I use this bag to store my Thundergirls uniform? Aw. I still can't believe you quit the Thundergirls. Are you gonna put away your thunder-wear? (chuckles) Congratulations on getting out of that cult, Tina. I was just getting too old for it, I guess. What do you mean "too old"? Dad, Tina's 13. In Thundergirl years, that's, like, 40. Hey. 40 is the new 38. Yeah, and 38 is the new... (meows) Yeah. Tina, what happened? There may have been a culture clash between me and the younger girls. I mean, I wouldn't say I was a stick in the mud... Look, a stick in the mud! In the old days, that's how a Thundergirl made a sun dial. Oh, that's nice, Tina. Did everyone see Tina's stick? Girls: Yes... Anyway, now that I have an opening in my schedule, I can spend more time with you guys. Okay, great. Gene, what do we got going on this week? Uh, you've got a bath night I can move around, but you've already moved it twice. Let's cancel it. Tina, you're in. Okay. Well, I know what I'm doing. I'm calling Gretchen at the salon. Say good-bye to the gray, kids. Fine. But I'm keeping this one. Ow! Oops, it's a black one. I'll put it back. Ugh, Gretchen, I'm so glad you got rid of those old-lady grays. No more salt with this pepper. You ready? Ready! Ta-da! (gasps) Oh! Oh, my God! Uh-oh. Yeah, uh-oh! L-Little mistake. You made me look like a zebra! Fix it! Please, fix it. Don't panic. Don't panic. Don't panic, Lin. Fix it! I know... I know what I can do. Dye it back! No. Dye it blonde. What? Trust me. Everything is better as a blonde. Everything looks better. Everything tastes better. Like what? Ketchup packets, cough drops... Ketchups? Come on. Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, Oh... do it, do it, do it. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! What the hell? (tinkling) Linda (sultrily): Can I get a menu, please? Whoa! Oh, my God. Gene: Ah! It's middle-aged Mom Barbie! I like your hair. It matches your teeth. Thank you, Tina. Sort of an extreme reaction to a few gray hairs, don't you think? No. I'm not having more fun yet. Wait! Yes, I am! You see? Gene gets it. Bobby, you try. No, I don't think so. Aw, come on! Tina? Um, can I do it later after the chemical smell wears off? Louise? Who said that? Where's Mom? Woman (quietly): Tina? Trash? No, it's Ginny. From Thundergirls. Ginny? What are you doing in our alley pretending to be the trash? I couldn't risk anyone seeing me. I'm here because Troop 119 has... a... mole. I thought Katie just had a beauty mark. No, a mole-mole. I think someone in our troop has been spying on us. For our archrivals, Troop 257. (gasps) Troop 257? They're the toughest troop in town. I heard they hold hot dogs in the fire with their bare hands. Yeah. I saw one of them at the mall, and I hid in the middle of a rack of clothes. But how could there be a mole in Troop 119? We pinky-swore we'd be friends forever. Except that one girl who didn't have a pinky and moved away. She had a lot going on. Tina, I know it sounds crazy, but it's the only explanation. You know how every year our cookie sales are pathetic? Yeah, that's our thing. It's because of the mole. She's been giving away our cookie leads to Troop 257. I wasn't 100% certain until last week... I was at my new job. Lot of cookie lovers there. I could smell it. I arranged for Troop 119 to come to my office and sell cookies. It was gonna be a huge score. But when we showed up, guess who beat us to the punch. Tina: Troop 257? GINNY: Yes. I had to eat Troop 257's cookies from my own break room. Tina: Well, you didn't have to. You... I had to, Tina. I had to! I'm so sorry. I've talked to all the girls in the troop, and I can't rule out any of them. The mole could be anybody. Except you, Tina. Oh, good. It can't be you because you left the troop before the humiliating office incident. That's why I need you to rejoin. Talk to the girls. Find the mole. Me? Rejoin? But my wounds are still fresh. I mean, I don't actually have wounds. And if I did, I would do first aid on them because I have that patch. Tina, every year at the cookie jamboree, I've had to explain why we have the lowest sales of anyone. I'm not doing it anymore. I'm not! Now, if I don't find the mole, I'm just... I'm gonna... I'm gonna dissolve the troop! Huh?! Dissolve Troop 119? No, you can't! Well, I'm gonna do it! Fine, I'll help you find your mole. Great. Okay. Thank you. And remember, don't tell anyone anything about this. Got it. This is between you, me, and my journal. No. No journal. I meant my secret journal. The one you don't know about. You just told me about it. Okay. I'll just write it in a letter and mail it to myself and not open it. No. Don't write it anywhere. Okay. Cool, cool, cool, cool. Cool. We're back in, original copy of the Thundergirls handbook that the other girls think is old and outdated, like me. High five. Gene: Hey, Tina. We're gonna go find shells and make me a shell bikini. Want to come? Whoa! What's with the Thundergirls uniform? I decided to rejoin the Thundergirls. What? No, Tina. You just got out. Now you're going back in? You're like the Brett Favre of Thundergirls. I couldn't stay away. I mean, it's not for any weird reason. It's not like there's a mole in our troop and I'm going undercover to catch her or anything. (chuckles nervously) Wait, wait, wait. Your troop has a mole? A thunder-mole? What? Where'd you get that idea? Is she giving away your cookie secrets or something? That's my stage name, Cookie Secrets. Actually, yes. To Troop 257. But you didn't hear it from me. Tina, you're the worst person to go undercover to catch a mole. You just spilled your whole story to us. You guys were all over me about it! All right, here's what you got to do. You got to go in there and rattle some cages. Grab those Thundergirls and shake 'em till you shake out a confession! It's me! It's me! I'm the mole! No, Louise. I have to go about this delicately. I have to make the mole feel safe so she comes to me. Ugh, Tina, you so need me on this. Do what I say and say what I say, and we'll have this case cracked by dinnertime. Louise, it's Thundergirls stuff. You wouldn't understand. I can handle this on my own. You don't need to get involved. (scoffs) Tina, please. I'm not gonna get involved. It's not like I'm gonna go out right now and buy a Thundergirls uniform and then show up at your meeting later. I mean, come on. Okay, good. Hey! I was thinking you guys could start calling me Blom. Because I'm blonde and I'm your mom. Get it? (chuckles) Mom, we're busy in here. Hey, don't talk to Blom like that. Thank you, Gene. Okay, Tina. You're back. I mean, you're not back. You're here to find the mole. I mean, maybe sing some songs and make some s'mores. But mostly to find the mole. Hey, good to see the braid trains are still running. Tina, come on in. Look who's back, everyone. Hey, guys. It's your cool, young, hip friend Tina. Can you dig it? You can take my place on the braid train. I have to get snack ready. I hope you all like chips with guaca-mole. Ginny, did you know that the last chip in the bowl is 93% skin cells? Ugh, yes, Jodi. This is nice. Oh, hey, should we play a game where we tell each other our deepest, darkest secrets? Just kidding. I mean, unless you want to. (door shuts) LOUISE: Room for one more on that Thundertrain? Huh? Oh. Hi. Are you... Nobody told me... I-I don't have any... Paperwork? Don't worry about it, honey. My lawyer's sending it over. Meet your newest, greenest, preteenest Thundergirl, me. No! I mean, welcome. Thank you. Louise, I can't believe you joined my Thundergirls troop. I told you I had everything under control. Also, your sash is a disaster. (grunts) (sighs) That was driving me crazy. Tina, forget about the stupid sash. We've got a mole to catch, girl! You and I are the mole patrol. (mimicking siren) Come on! Do it! Beep, beep. No, l... Look at my mouth. (mimicking siren) Let's just get down to business. All right, here's what we know: Troop 119 has a mole who is giving away secrets to Troop 257. Gene: Mm. So, which one of you is sabotaging our cookie sales? Katie. She's in honors math. Louise: Or... she's an evil genius. Ooh. Tina: Julie. She's kind of a motor mouth. Louise: Is she yapping about troop secrets? Hmm? Tina: Rena. She's a little on the short side. But maybe she's telling tall tales. Mm-hmm. Tina: Jodi. She wears rubber gloves because she's a major germophobe. Or so she won't leave any fingerprints behind. (gasps) And finally there's Molly. She's double-jointed. Or a double-crosser. Tina: Any one of them could be the mole. But who? Gene: Look at this suspicious character. Gene... Just let me into your world! (sighs) Fine. You... go through everyone's trash, okay? Dig around. Look for... Half-eaten sandwiches? No, clues! They're not mutually exclusive! So we all agree, a surgical mole removal and no one gets hurt. Right, Louise? Yeah, we all agree. But what if I just did this? Ah! Ah! And now we sh**t them. Just kidding. I kind of thought that'd be more fun. Let's go trip Dad.  So blonde, so delicate and blonde.  (sultrily): Here are your buns, Mr. Belcher. Why are you calling me Mr. Belcher? Don't say 'cause I'm your boss... 'Cause you're my boss... And you're my sexy assistant. And I'm your sexy assistant. Yes. I'm gonna take off all my clothes and wait for you in the walk-in. I don't think that's a good idea to... (whoops) Ow! That hit my eye. Yes, it did. It really hurts. (groans) Let me look at it, you big baby. Oh! I'm the blonde nurse! No. No, no. It's World War II. You got sh*t in the eye. No. The chemistry between us is smoldering. Oh, my God. Let me see it. This... The fantasy doesn't work. Why? I-I feel like if I got sh*t in the eye, I would want you to help my eye. And my brain. Well, I don't know. I'm not a freaking doctor. I'm a nurse, Bob. Well, can you get a doctor? 'Cause I need a doctor. Oh, wait. (deep male voice): Uh, I'm a doctor. No. Not... Uh, let me look at that over here. Oh, my God. How are your bracelets coming along, girls? Fine. Good. Fine. I'm giving my bracelet to my new baby sister. She's so cute and she has almost no jewelry. I'm giving mine to Katie. I'm giving mine to Julie. Jinx! (chuckles) Jinx! (chuckles) (groans) I mean... (laughs) (quietly): Okay, time to put the plan into action. Phase one: Get them to trust me. That's a pretty bracelet, Julie. Thanks! Okay, phase one complete. Phase two: Turn everyone against each other until the mole is flushed out. Wait, what? Katie told me she thinks your bracelet's ugly. Huh? (scoffs) Oh, no. Oh, yes.     (indistinct arguing) Okay, I found some pretty cool stuff, and I've organized everyone's trash into piles. Whose trash is that? Jodi's. Hmm. Interesting. It's all interesting. Each pile tells a story. For example, last night, Rena had chicken. The end. Louise! Everyone in Troop 119 hates each other. This is exactly what I was worried about. I believe what you're trying to say is, "Thank you. Thank you, Louise, for helping me smoke out the mole." Louise, you're going to destroy the troop! Why do you care so much about the troop, anyway? They rejected you, remember? Troop 119 shaped me into the woman I am. I thought your underwear did that. Tina, we tried things your way. No, we didn't. I did in my head, and it didn't work. You'll thank me later when we remove the mole. Changing subject. Be honest, do I look like a Jessica? This is nice. Wait. Where's Louise? And where's Jodi? Katie, will you watch my lanyard? I'll be right back. (whispers): Let's mess with her lanyard. I know you know something. Tell me, or the glasses get a swirly! I don't know what you're talking about! And I can't see what you're doing! I'm holding your glasses over the toilet! (screaming) Louise! Sorry, Jodi. Let me get your glasses back for you. (exhaling) Wait, now what are you doing? Just that thing where I breathe on the lenses and wipe them off with my shirt. (screaming) I was just about to break her! You're causing too much trouble! At least I'm doing something. While you're making lanyards, whatever those are, I'm the one doing the dirty work. No more dirty work, Louise. I think... (sighs) I think you should leave the troop. Wha... What about mole patrol?! I'm shutting it down. (slowing): Wee-ooh-wee-ooh. That was the sound of the siren shutting down. Okay, fine, I will leave. That's a great idea! Oh, it is? Oh, yeah! So no hard feelings? Nope! Ginny: All right, everyone, let's make milk carton bird feeders. One last milk carton bird feeder for the road? Good-bye! Bye. See you at home. Which one of you lucky mamajammas wears a size 14 boot and isn't all hung up about having one for each foot? Ugh. Gene, what are you wearing? Trash fashion. I call it trashion. We should probably get you a tetanus sh*t. Belcher residence. Tina, can you tell Mom and Dad I'll be late for dinner? My meeting's running long. I hope Mom doesn't get too upset. Oh, okay. Wait, what meeting? Oh, just a troop meeting. You know how it goes. Got it. Oh, yeah, yeah. What troop? Troop 257, Tina. You joined Troop 257? No, Louise, you can't do that. They're the enemy troop. Too late. Got to go. Bye-bye! Hello? Louise? Let's get to know our newest member. Troop 2-5-7! Whoo! You guys are the fun-dergirls over here, am I right? Good start, good start. Girl: New girl, I didn't catch your name. Alanis. Where'd you say you moved from again? New York, New York. Oh, my cousin... Not the one in New York. New York, New York, Michigan. Oh. Hey, so what are we doing, making bracelets? Bracelets? (laughter) Girls, why don't you do some wood carving today? (laughs): Okay! What are we whittling? Well, you could whittle a bear or a heart... We're whittling knives! (laughing): You girls and your knives! Hey, guys, sorry... I had to stay late at school. We had a bullying lesson. From me. (blowing three raspberries) Girls: 2-5-7! What the hell was that? Our handshake. Love it or lick it, snurb. Hey, I love it already, snurb. (blows raspberry) No, it's like this. (blowing three raspberries) Girls: 2-5-7! Aah! That's awesome! Do it again! All right. Rock and roll. (blowing three raspberries) (laughs): Oh, girls. Girls: 2-5-7! How's it going? Any leads yet? I did some research on good places to go on our retreat. I thought we could all spend some time together, talk, create a safe environment. We don't have time to create a safe environment! Ginny, I couldn't help but notice it smells kind of moldy in here. And so I have a couple names of really good mold people... Oh! Not now, Jodi! I'll just... I'll leave the list over here. I brought you back in here to do a job. My duct tape wallet got stuck in my hair. Well, then cut your hair, Rena! Okay. The cookie deadline is next week. If we don't catch the mole before then, this troop is done! Uh... what do I do, what do I do? I'm sorry, Thundergirls, I've let you down. Maybe Louise was right... I don't have what it takes. I'm just a washed-up old Thunderhag! (frustrated grunt) (gasps) Son of a b1tch. Linda:  La, la, la-la, la, la blonde  La-la, la, la, la, blonde...  Lin, you've messed up this order. Blonde? That's the third time today you've got an order wrong, and we've only had three customers. Blonde? Yeah, and I found a bunch of cheese slices in the cash register. Oh. Uh-oh. I think being blonde is making me dumb. Uh, no, it's that you haven't paid attention to anything else but your hair since you dyed it. No, really, I feel kind of dumb. Well, you are kind of dumb. Bob! I'm kidding. I am kidding. You're very smart. Oh, see? I don't get kidding anymore. Gretchen: Linda? Who's that brown-haired beauty spinning around in your restaurant? Who's that girl? It's m... Whoa! Oh. Gretchen: I really am dizzy, I really... Oh, boy. Help me up, please. Oh, my God. Gretchen, you're a brunette now? I'm like the Tina Fey of my salon now. Everyone thinks I'm so smart and funny. Really? Yeah. So, how's it going, James Blonde? Ha-ha-ha-ha! Uh, that's one of my jokes. You might not get it 'cause you're blonde. I do get it, Gretchen. I think. Well, I'm off to the library to pick up smart guys. Good-bye, Gretchen. Real quick, Bob, what do you think of the hair? I changed it. I know. Yep. Good-bye, Gretchen! You know what they say... once you go brown. Bye! Louise. Tina. Nice sash... except for the numbers on it. Nice detective work... except for not catching the mole. By the way, I'm heading to a meeting right now. A huge cookie lead just came in. So I guess I got to go solve this thing all by myself. Well, say hi to 257 for me. But don't, because I hate them. I mean, "hate" is a strong word, but... Okay, while you're finishing that thought, I'm gonna go catch the mole. Thundergirls forever! Thundergirls forever. We're 2-5-7! Girls: Tell 'em! What do we do with cookies? Girls: Sell 'em! And what do we do with seat belts? Girls: Shut up! Okay, I'll-I'll just drive slow. Fingers in! (blowing three raspberries) 2-5-7! How'd we find out about this cookie lead? Huh? I'm just curious. I mean, you guys seem to have a lot of leads. We're here! Oh, no. You know this place? This place? Blech! Yeah, I got food poisoning here. Gross! You know what? I can't even go in. I'm gonna, like, throw up. What are you talking about, Alanis? You've got to help carry cookies. (sighs) Fine. Be right there. Just got to adjust my sash. Aw, it's... does anybody's sash just choke you? No. Hi, Thundergirls. Are you the cookie buyer? No... yeah... no. What? You wanted to buy 500 boxes of cookies? Uh, no, we didn't. I'll take 'em. Gene, no. Fine, 70. No, not 70. Sign here. 450? Don't sign that. Just sign it. Louise? Why are you dressed like a Thundermummy? Louise? Huh, you must have me confused with someone else. I'm Alanis. What? Louise, what's going on? Why do they think we want cookies? Why do these people keep calling you Louise? These people happen to be her parents. Wait. Where's Tina? What troop is this? All: 2-5-7! These people are her parents? What are they saying?! Well, bye! Hey, look who it is. People that I just don't even know, because I'm not in that troop. Louise! Tina sent us a 911 text to meet her here. What's going on? That's what we'd like to know, Alanis. What are you guys doing here, 257? This is our turf. Are we rumbling, or what? Oh, my God! Hold on, Larissa. Alanis is gonna tell us what's going on. (chuckles) There's a good explanation for everything that I'm gonna tell you when I think of it outside. Oh! Geez! I can explain what's going on. I know who the mole is. (all gasping) You guys are making banana nut fudge cookies with macadamias now?! Tina, what is going on? Why did I dye my hair blonde? I don't understand anything anymore! I said, I know who the mole is. Allow me to explain. In the original edition of the Thundergirls handbook, it says: "If you want to trap a rabbit, you don't set one trap, you set five." I gave all of you a fake cookie lead, each one at a different location on Ocean Avenue. Then I staked out Ocean Avenue, knowing that 257 would show up to one of the fake leads. I brought enough food, supplies and toilet paper for days. Luckily, they showed up before I finished my first roll. Gotcha. That's when I texted everyone to come meet me here. Wow! That's impressive. Okay, I am still lost. So, who was it? Let's just say it rhymes with "Tina." It's you?! No, it's Rena. (others gasp) Rena! Is that true? (sputters) I'm not a mole! Tina, how do we know you didn't tell Troop 257 to come here? This is your family's restaurant. Uh... oh, yeah, good point. Yeah! Hold on a sec. I found these in Rena's trash! So? Those are my old soccer cleats. Well, they fit me perfectly, and I'm grateful to you! This is ridiculous. Tina's obviously trying to frame me. Tina?! No! No, I'm not. I'm not framing her. Wait, Rena. (blowing three raspberries) Girls: 2-5-7! Uh-oh. Rena is the mole! I was right! I knew it! I knew it was you! But you just accused me on the ride over here. Yeah, you accused me, too. I knew it was someone! The only thing I couldn't figure out was why... why'd you do it, Rena? (heavy sigh) My first year as a Thundergirl was in Troop 257... best year of my life. We were in a vicious cookie turf battle with Troop 119. Drastic measures had to be taken. I was selected for a very special assignment... to leave the troop I love and pretend to love the troop I hate. We thought you were our friend! All these friendship bracelets, did they mean nothing? You mean this arm garbage? Larissa. (deep, strained grunting) (deep yell) Geez. I thought Tina took this Thundergirl stuff seriously. You guys are intense. Yeah. You're like Linda Hamilton when she does all those angry pull-ups. Let's hear it for Tina! Girls: Yay! Ugh! Come on. Let's get out of here. Oh, wait! We want to buy your cookies! Girls: No! Oh, right, right. No. With these glasses, my garbage ensemble is complete. It's good. I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I love it. One man's trash is Gene's next outfit. Pick me out something next time you go. What do you like to smell like? Mm, surprise me. Well, another great Thundergirls meeting. Look... I got a "wise owl" patch for demonstrating the wisdom of an older Thundergirl. Got to hand it to you, T. You earned that patch... you caught the mole and saved the troop. I-I know... I just said that. So you're sticking with the Thundergirls, huh? I kind of hoped you were done with that extremely long chapter of your life. Linda: Aw... the mole patrol's gonna miss hanging out with each other. No. I mean, maybe. (gasps) You were a little jealous of the Thundergirls. Taking your big sister away... that's very insightful, Linda. I'm back! Aah! I feel like I could read a book! Louise, you could always come back to Troop 119. Nah. Thundergirls is your bag, and if I had to, I would probably join Troop 257. But if there's a m*rder or a drug sting, call me. Well, I made this friendship bracelet for you. Eh, you know, I'm not really a jewelry person. You don't have to wear it. No, I'm gonna wear it forever. Back off. Girls: 2-5-7!
Kids, before you go to school, you want to see some art? I've already looked in the mirror once today, so I am good. (clicks tongue) Is this a trick? We say "sure" and then you moon us? No. You know that customer who always doodles on his napkins? Look what he drew yesterday. Bob: Oh. It's a fisherman. And he used the grease stain as a lake. That's a good use of grease. You know what, maybe we should put it up over here. Start a wall of customer drawings, right? Huh. A wall of napkin art. That's a good idea, Lin. It is a good idea, Mom. But you know what isn't? Putting your coffee mug so close to the edge of the counter. That's a piping hot cup of ouch. Thank you, Tina. Ugh, we get it. You're a hall monitor. Leave your work at school. Sorry. But all my hall monitoring is gonna pay off. I think Mr. Frond is about to promote me to the highest hall monitor rank there is. (majestic music playing) It's called Hall Manatee. Hall Manatee? Why is it called that? There are two schools of thought about that. No, never mind. I don't want to hear. Okay. Hi, Ms. Selbo. Signing in for hall monitor duty? You know, there's a rumor going around that you're up for a big promotion. Oh, don't listen to rumors, Ms. Selbo. (laughing): Then what would I do? Just answer the phone when it rings? Tina, come on. Here's your vest. Good luck, Mana-Tina. What? You didn't hear it from me. Hi, Tina. I-I went ahead and signed you in. That was thoughtful, Rudy, but it's against the rules to forge a signature on the sign-in sheet. Oh, yeah. The rules. I guess I played it pretty fast and loose. Yeah, let's save fast and loose for when you shake your caboose. Rules were made to be followed. Right, sorry. See, that's why you're gonna be a Hall Manatee and I'm stuck at Hall Minnow. Well, I'm also a Hall Minnow 'cause I'm bad at networking. Third period. Lunch is 40 minutes away. Kids are hungry and cranky, which means out in the hallway anything can happen. Got it. (panting) Oh, slow you didn't. Huh? I'm saying you weren't going slow in the hall. Slow you didn't? I should have been more clear. Sorry. Full name and grade? Danny Duszynski, fifth. Duszynski. Thank you, Danny. (quietly): You stupid... Whoa. What's that? Bye. Thank you. You're welcome. Whoa, he used language. No, I think he just said "thank you." Tina, can I just say it? You inspire me. (squeaking) I know. Hold on. I recognize that sound. It's butts on brass. Huh? Follow me. Louise: I love gravity! I'm glad I wore my fast pants! Hey, guys. You just slid into detention. Nice. I'm gonna need a full name and grade from both of you. (chuckles) I get it. Good psych-out, Tina. You scared us straight. Uh, full name and grade. I can't tell you my full name! You know Mom won't tell me my middle name! Geez, Tina, what are you, Narcy Narc and the Narcy Bunch? Fine. Louise and Gene Belcher. All right, off to class. And I'll see you at home. What's Mom making tonight? Anyone know? Good talk. Wow, that was cold-blooded. I guess when you're a hall monitor you have to leave your feelings in your locker. And lose the combination. Yeah... MR. FROND (over speaker): Hall monitors on duty, report immediately to Coach Blevins' office. Uh-oh. Let's move. Let me go. Dang. Ugh, Zeke. You called us, Mr. Frond? Ah, Tina. My star hall monitor. And Regular Sized Rudy. My fixer-upper hall monitor. I'll get there. Anyway, I stepped away from class to retrieve my shatterproof sports goggles... Rudy: Suh-weet. Thanks. When I got to my office, I found Zeke in here digging around. Trespassing in a teacher's office. This is strike three for you, Zeke. I'm afraid that means automatic suspension. Uh, but I got a good reason. Save it. Tina, I need you to escort Zeke to the principal's office. I'd do it myself, but I dropped my cell phone in the toilet, and I need to put it in rice immediately. Has anyone tried that? Does it work? Ha! Mr. Frond's got a smell phone. (chuckles sarcastically) You're suspended. (groans) Tina, think you can handle this? I don't think you can handle how much I can handle this, Mr. Frond. Let's go, Zeke. (groans) I'll take it from here, Rudy. You finish your rounds. Are you sure? Zeke's trouble. It's a midday run. I could do it in my sleep. Yeah, but I want to help. I've never transported a perp. Yeah, we're good, Rudy. Oh. Oh, wow. Tina's giving Rudy some 'tude-y. (chuckles) Shut up, Zeke. I'm sorry I said "shut up." You shut up. Look what Teddy did! Funky pattern. I'm putting it up! Teddy: Spirals, right? Welcome to my brain. Look at mine, Linda. Aw, it's a sun wearing sunglasses. Someone's feeling silly. Guilty! Uh, here you go. Here's mine. Ah. Ooh. Yeah. What is it? It's a face. I don't recognize it. Well, it's no one in particular. It's just a face. Hmm. Could it be a foot? Oh, I see it now! It's a beautiful face. So are you gonna put it on the wall? What? Yeah. S-Sure. Yeah, of cour... I'm gonna put it up. Wall. Well, it doesn't seem like you want to. Oh, here's a spot for it. Right there. Uh. Wait. Y... Lin, you're putting it behind the coffee machine. (laughing): Am I? Forget it. If... I-I don't want you to put it up if you don't like it. Okay. That was close. We were gonna have to look at that thing every time they moved the coffee pot. Sorry, Teddy. Sorry it's not a spiral or a sun with sunglasses. Speaking of spirals... Whoa! Right? Oh, I'm dizzy! Another one's going up! Oh, my God. Put it... put it right there. Come on! The time doesn't fit the crime. You got to let me go! Enough, Zeke. You're the one who broke into the gym teacher's office. (groans) Okay, listen, I did it for my grandma. Sure you did. (groans) Well, can I at least use the bathroom before you turn me in? I don't think so. Please! Have a heart, Tina! Good gosh. Okay. But make it quick. All right! Thanks, T-Bird! (whoops) TINA: Okay. Zeke? Zeke, as your hall monitor, I'm ordering you: Come out with your hands washed. That's odd. Anybody in here? I'm coming in on 90% official hall monitor business. And 10% curiosity. Zeke? Answer me, Zeke. I know you're in there. I can see your shoes. Huh. Where'd your legs go? What the... Oh, no. I lost Zeke. Aah! Tina. (gasps) Mr. Frond. How'd it go? Did Zeke give you any trouble? Well, uh... Of course he did. But I'm sure you handled it, right? (groaning nervously) Tina? Tina? God, that sound makes me queasy, Tina. It went great. I dropped him off at the principal, and the principal said, "Thank you, Tina." Everything was fine. Terrific. That's why you're the best. (groaning nervously) Stop it! (gasps) Tina. (inhales) Liar. (coughs) (quietly): Zeke. Zeke. Come out. Everyone's... wrestling out here. I'm being wrestled. Oh, hey, Tina. Ah! Sorry to interrupt. Everything okay with Zeke? Everything's fine. What a weird thing to bring up. Come on. It's Regular Sized Rudy. You can talk regular to me. Everything is great, Rudy! It's really, really, really, really great! Okay, but... it just seem... Got to go. Everything's great. See you soon. (sighs) I can't believe it. My hero's gone dirty. Stand down, feelings. Stand down. Time for Rudy to clean up this mess. (snorts) (sighs) It's almost lunchtime. Once these halls fill up with people, I'll never find Zeke. I should call for backup. Why'd you pull us out of class? Yeah, I was learning stuff! You guys, I need your help. Oh, do you? You busted us today like we were just a couple of butt-sliding strangers! Yeah! We all slid out of the same place, sister! It was nothing personal. Well, then nothing personal, but if you want our help, it's gonna cost you big-time! Yeah! Ok-Okay, um, I-I can give you each a hall pass. Is that all? Then we will pass on that offer. Wait! What if I could give you... (whispers): A permanent hall pass? A perma-pass? Is that real? Could it be? One hall pass to rule them all. It exists, but only for kids with serious medical conditions. Lucky! So we help you get promoted... And these halls are yours. All right. You got our attention. What's the job? I lost Zeke. I was supposed to get him to the office, but he got away. I need you to help me get him back. Is that all? Think, Tina. How do you find someone who doesn't want to be found? You rough up that someone's friend. Jimmy Jr.? Oh, I don't think we need to ask him anything about this. Want to get Zeke? Then suck it up, T. J-Ju! Buddy! What's going on, man? (sighs) What do you want, Louise? What do I want? (chuckles) I want to chat. (quietly): Watch for lunch ladies and Feds. All right, where is he? Where is who? Your buddy Zeke. He's hiding somewhere in school. I-I don't know anything about it. Oh, no? Tell me something. You're a dancer. How important is it for a dancer to have toes?! Uh, that didn't hurt, Louise. Why not?! That was my whole body! I'm wearing thick socks? Okay. Take your socks off. No. Where's Zeke, Jimmy Jr.?! Whoa. Yikes. I told your sister, Tina, I don't know. That's not good enough. Ew, Tina, this tray is gross! Too bad you chose chowder day to lie to me. It's chowder day? Okay! I don't know for sure, but there's a place Zeke goes sometimes. He calls it his hidey-hole. Where is it? Stop it, Tina! (grunts) The storage room! Over by the science lab! Now take off your socks! Yeah, take off your socks! Okay! Oh, wait. Um, don't take off your socks. Put them back on. Sorry. Yeah, it wouldn't make much sense. Wait, so put 'em back on or... Put it back on! Okay! Faster! Faster! It's not going on! Put them on! Now! They're all sweaty! Okay. A little shading over here. Looks good. Uh, Lin, take a look. I did another one. Mmm. Hmm. I went back to the drawing board. Literally. (chuckles) And I... and I drew something I know I could never mess up... a burger. Yeah. It's good. Oh, my God. You are so bad at pretending you like it. What are you talking about? It's so good I want to eat it. (munching sounds) Look, I just ate it. Okay, let's put it up. We'll put it up. No, Lin, I-I don't want a sympathy hang. Do you like it or not? Mike the Mailman! Get in here! Talk to us! Please. You know what, don't use Mike as an excuse to change the subject, Lin. What was the subject? Your marriage? What? Oh, doodle wall, huh? Yeah! What do you think, huh? Artsy. May I? (humming) Boom. 3-D cube. Oh, my God, it's perfect! Mmm. That's good. Yeah. Oh, it's jumping out at me! Oh. Oh, it's going on the wall. You know what the trick is? Draw a square, draw another square, connect 'em. See, you never know. People could be a mailman but they're also an artist. Why is everybody good at this but me?! Okay, someone's jealous. I love it, Mike. Whoa. This is a good hidey-hole. What this room really needs is a desk. Zeke? You in here? You go low, we'll go high. (grunting) Zeke? Gene: Look! You see him? No, it's a box of chalk nubs! Nub party! (clanging)   (gasps) Zeke, I can hear you. There! There he is! Uh-oh. (grunting) (grunting) Get out, Tina! You have nowhere left to crawl. I told you, I'm innocent! I don't care. All right, only one thing left to do. Jump to freedom! I'm coming, Grandma! (grunts) You still have nowhere left to crawl. (grunts) What is this? Chinese finger trap. I got it as a party favor. But in America. All right. (grunting): Is there a trick to it? Don't tell me. (grunting) Okay, tell me. No. Got your man, Tina. And I'm eating this chalk. We all did good. (swallows) I'll take it from here, guys. Whoa, whoa. Whoa. What about our perma-passes? Those exist? Dang! I heard they tattoo 'em on your neck and it hurts, but it's worth it. No, but they're laminated. Here. If anyone asks, you have irritable bowel syndrome. All bowels are irritable. Hey, ticket to ride. I'm Louise. (whispers): Let's roll. Let's go everywhere in the world except class. (strained grunting) It's almost like the harder I pull, the tighter it gets. (grunting) RUDY: Aha! Found you! Rudy! You lied to Mr. Frond! You said you delivered Zeke. I am delivering him. Now. Back off, Rudy. You were my hero. Now look at you! Dang! Zeke's coming with me. Easy, squirt. Detach him, Tina. I'm bringing Zeke in, and I'm reporting you to Mr. Frond. You blew it, man. No! I worked too hard for this promotion. Hand over the Zeke! (bell rings) (grunting) Lunch is over. Hey, look, uh, a kid, uh, doing something dangerous and breaking a rule. Oh, rules are... Oh. Hey, come back! What are you doing! The principal's office is the other way. There's more than one way to the principal's office. There are two ways. Here we go. This guy. What?! Hi. Uh, so, um, I need a quick drawing lesson. Oh, you must mean the Emergency Drawing Package. Yes. D-Do you have that? No! 'Cause there's no such thing! Takes years of training to be an artist. Years! Look, you're the only real artists I know. You're very talented. Well, actually, Harold's not that good. I'm-I'm fair. You're not, honey. I am! You know you aren't. Okay. Look, I would really appreciate it if you'd help me... I'd be... honored. All right. Stop groveling! We'll give you a crash course. Really? Thank you. I'll set up the studio. Harold, sell him the supplies. All right. $30! For a pencil and a pad of paper? You want to learn to draw?! Pay the man! All right, all right, all right. Come on, we just need to get around to the front of the school. Zeke: Can I ask you something? Why do you want to be a hall monitor, anyway? It's just telling on kids. It's not telling on kids. It's helping on kids. Well, you aren't helping on me. It's your own fault. You've committed a series of Mr. Wieners. That's what I call misdemeanors. Cool. Funny words make the job fun. Yeah. Listen, this is the truth. I broke into Coach's office so I could take the mascot uniform. The Wagstaff Whaler? Why? I told you... for my grandma. She's having surgery today, and I just wanted to mascot around for her before she went under the knife. You expect me to believe that? Yeah. Grandma likes mascots. She met my grandpa when they were mascottin' in college. They looked into each other's big dumb foam eyes, and that was it. (gasps) Miss Labonz! If she sees us, we'll be in big trouble. What are you two kids doing outside? Uh... What are you doing, Miss L? Smoking. Cool. Smoking is not cool, Zeke. Yes, it is. N-No, it's not. Especially when teachers do it. That's cool! It's like you're teaching me to smoke. I love this stuff! Don't... Stop saying that, Zeke. We're like best friends, man. No, we're not. No. We're bonding over cigarettes. That's pretty cool. We are not bonding over cigarettes! Sure we are. Hey, hey, let me get one of those! I've been dying to try one of them. You two get to class! Come on, throw one in my mouth. I'll see if I can catch it. Stop. Stop talking to me. Took care of that. Adults get really nervous when you ask them for cigarettes. Quick thinking. Thanks. That's how you help a kid. Not by being a narc. Whoa. Okay, what's happening, exactly? Life drawing. If you can draw a nude figure, you can draw anything. Grab your charcoal, Charlie! Lady's a-waitin'. Okay, um, wha-what do I draw first? The gesture, and then the essence, and then the breasts. I don't see you drawing! Sorry, I can't look up. Harold, be my eyes... how's he doing? Bad. Listen, I'm trying. I just can't breathe right now. Oh, you don't like what you see, huh? Oh, it's good. No, it's fine. Get used to it... it's the human form. It's the most beautiful thing you're ever gonna see in your life. It's super yummy. Tell him! I just wasn't expecting the hair. (grunts) If you don't let me go, I'm gonna chew my finger off! Zeke! Come on! Grandma's gonna have to leave for the hospital soon! Even if what you were saying was true, you still should have asked for the mascot suit. I did. I asked Coach B if I could borrow the suit fair and square, but he wouldn't let me. Probably thought I was gonna poop in it. Just 'cause I used to poop in stuff. Give it up, Zeke. Almost there. Oh, Rudy. Tina, you leave me no choice. Mr. Frond...! No! Zeke? You should be in the principal's office. He was... um, 'cause I took him, obviously. She never took him. She never took him. (gasps) Tina, is this true? Yes. How's your cell phone doing? It's dead. Oh, I heard that rice thing, that that's supposed to... I'm very disappointed in you, Tina. Clearly you couldn't handle this responsibility. Now, un-trap your fingers. You say that like it's easy. Oh...! Let's do it again! Hi, Ms. Selbo. Hi, Tina. (whispers): I heard a rumor that you were disgraced. What? Wagstaff front desk. You're calling from where, ma'am? The Elegant Doily Retirement Home? Oh, that's right down the street. Sometimes your wanderers come here. Well, I don't know if your grandson is still coming to visit... who is he? Oh, Zeke. I'll see if I can find him for you. (gasps) Zeke was telling the truth. Perma-pass! We can do anything we want within limits! Hey, uh, guys, listen, I owe you both an apology. Yeah. My ambition got the best of me. Uh-huh. I've let it turn me into a bad hall monitor and an even worse sister. Yes, you did. I'm sorry. We forgive you. Gene! Leave her hanging for a second. Shove your apology! Yeah! That's fair. Okay, okay. We forgive you. Ah, thank you. And there's one more thing. We need to help Zeke. Tina, I hate to tell you this, but that's not Zeke. Okay, Zeke is in the principal's office being watched by Ms. Schnur and Mr. Frond. The principal naps in his car every day until 1:45. That gives us seven minutes to spring Zeke. How are we gonna get past Mr. Frond? Forget Frond... it's Ms. Schnur you've got to worry about. She's short, but she's got a seven-foot wingspan. It's okay. I have an idea. I told you, my grandma's about to go under... Oh, spare me the grandma stuff. Grandma excuses are older than grandmas themselves. Hey, Penny Marshall's outside! The Penny Marshall?! Yeah. And she said something about needing a new best friend. (gasps) That could be me! Ms. Schnur, Penny Marshall is not outside. Mr. Frond, if she is out there and I don't go out, I will never forgive myself! Out of my way! Ms. Schnur, no! Zeke, run! (grunts) Come here, get up. Uh, counsel me. No, counsel me. Not now. Counsel me! Counsel me! I'm messed up! I'm a big mess! Zeke. What's going on? Take it. What? And go. Damn, Tina. Now I got a story to tell on our wedding day. You think that's not gonna happen, but I'll get you, girl. I'm gonna get you. Okay, d-don't say anything, just go. Frond: Zeke, come back here! Let him go, Mr. Frond. He's going to see his grandma before she has surgery. His grandma? You naive little wide-eyed candy-dandy fool. This is Zeke we're talking about. Once, he faked lice. I think he used Sea-Monkeys. But I was in Ms. Selbo's office when his grandma called. Anyone can get a friend to pretend to be someone's grandma. There are services that do that. Mr. Frond, we're hall monitors. But people aren't halls. Tell that to Darryl Hall. And Anthony Michael Hall. Arsenio Hall. Okay, a lot of people are Halls. But what I'm saying is people are complicated. Life is complicated. And sometimes even liars tell the truth. I believe Zeke. You do, huh? Okay, I'll bet you he's lying. If I'm wrong, you're not in trouble. And, what the heck, I'll give you your promotion. Forget the promotion. If you're wrong, Zeke's not suspended. Sure, I'll even throw in some ice cream for Zeke's imaginary granny after her imaginary surgery. And you have to marry her for citizenship. What happens if Tina loses? One month's detention. And you turn in your vest. And your finger trap. But that's mine. If I win, I want it. Cool bet, Tina. But Zeke does this kind of thing a lot. And that's coming from a girl who does this kind of thing a lot. Yeah, think about it, T. You're on, Frond. Terrific. To the nursing home! We're coming, too. Yeah! Frond: Great! Come along. W-wait, where's everybody going? We're going on a "splash of cold hard truth in Tina's face" field trip! I didn't get a slip for that. Okay, here we are. Zeke's grandma? Is Zeke's grandma here? Yes. Yep, that is definitely Zeke's grandma. Huh? Oh, that's strange. There's Zeke's grandma, but I don't see Zeke anywhere. Maybe that's because... (chanting): Liars are liars, and people are bad. Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, I am right! Are you my surgeon? I can't believe Zeke's not here. Sorry, Tina. I was kind of hoping he would be here, too. Zeke: Y'all ready for this?! (gasps) No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. (singing upbeat rock melody) (laughs) You lose, Frond. You lose! (grunting to music) Whalers in the front! (grunts) Let me hear you grunt! (grunts) That's my boy. Ice cream time! There's an ice cream truck around here somewhere, Mr. Frond. Better go find it. Okay, okay, okay, I'm going. Walk, don't run. Nice! There you are. Where were you? Did you go to the store or something? I did, in a way. And what I bought was a new me. A me who can draw! Look at this, Lin. (gasps) It's naked Edith! It's good. Kids, look... it's naked Edith. Naked Edith! Naked Edith! Saggy and sophisticated. Just like it says on her bumper sticker. Mm-hmm. Oh, oh, look what I'm doing. Right now. Look, look where it's going. Really? Yep. I made the wall. You made the wall sexy. Look at all those nooks and crannies. Yeah, lotta-lotta folds. (peppy music playing with Zeke grunting and singing along) Zeke: Whalers in the front! Let me hear you grunt! (grunting rhythmically) Whalers in the front! Let me hear you grunt! (grunting rhythmically)
Mom and Dad might not recognize us when we get back from go-karting. 'Cause our hair will be like this. And our faces will be like this! And our penises will be like this. You can't see what I'm doing, but it's pretty great. Three youth tickets, please. Sorry, track's closed for the rest of the day. League racing. What?! What? But I pedaled all this way to put the pedal to the metal. You'll have to come back another time. Perhaps check the online calendar that I work so hard on that no one bothers to look at. If I'm online, I'm looking at sloths. Whoa, Mama like. Tina: They're fast, and I'm curious. Screw regular go-karting. I want to do that. Every kid wants to be in league racing. Get in line. Okay, where's the line? (chuckles) Funny, honey. The only way to join the circuit is to get a kart. No problem. Where do we get one? They're custom. They cost a grand, at least. (groaning): Ah! I know you from somewhere. You're Bryce from Kingshead lsland, aren't you? Yep. Oh, yeah. Remember us? Nope. Ouch. Too bad you won't be joining the league. It would've been fun chucking raisins at you as I blow by. Geesh-geesh, goosh-goosh. Tina: Ow. Ow. Oh, my God, I hate him. (laughs) Hard to hate a guy who gives you raisins. (chewing loudly) Three burgers of the day. Who are your pals, Teddy? These guys are from the home brew supply shop. I brought 'em over here to try your burgers with Teddy's Brewski. What's Teddy's Brewski? It's the name of my home-brewed beer. I used to call it Bucket Brew, since that's where it ferments. In a bucket. Is it safe to drink? You know, it's just that you brewed it in a bucket. Of course it's safe. It's alcohol. Mmm... Mmm... Right? Mm-hmm. Oh. Mmm. Aw, so cute. Your burgers and his beer are making little belly babies. Ew. What? Oh, Bob. Bob! Bob! What what? What? You should sell my beer! We could be partners! What? Teddy, I-I don't think restaurants are allowed to sell home-brewed beer. Aw, who's gonna care? The health inspector, the Bureau of Alcohol, the police... So we won't get caught. We'll run it like a speakeasy. I'll be like Al Capone with breasts. Come on, Bob, just taste your burger and then my beer. Well, it's pretty hard to pair my burgers with the right beer. Oh, my God. Right? Huh? Oh, my God. That's amazing. Let's do it! It's amazing! Let's do it! (chuckles) Yes! (shouts) Maybe Mom and Dad would sponsor a go-kart if it was advertising for the restaurant. (sighs) They can't even sponsor their electric bill. Or maybe a sponsorship would work. Hey, Mr. Fischoeder! I missed you. Damn. Where have you been? Oh, around. How would you like to have semi-exclusive advertising rights on a go-kart that you pay for? Me pay kids? That sounds weird. How 'bout you pay me... that sounds better... No. Um... Huh. Hold on. I haven't finished. For one of these! A broken-down bumper car? Perhaps you kids can turn one of these not go-karts into a very much go-kart. Someone's sleeping back here, Mr. Fish. (snoring) That's our employee lounge. Owen, wake up! Hmm. You look like you've got something to prove. Guys, I think this is the one. Ooh, that's the most expensive one. We'll give you three bucks for it. Deal. Unless you want to make it eight dollars for a second bumper car, plus Owen, whom I will throw in for free. What can he do? Lord knows. It all remains to be seen. He's a mass of potential. Now all we need is a lawn mower engine. Or a steam engine. Or a motorcycle engine. So how much is it gonna cost us, Critter? Aw, come on, I can't charge you guys. Our kid was born inside your restaurant. Plus, I think the parts will be donated, if you catch my drift. Come on, people, let's tear this old dog apart, teach it new tricks!   Half bumper car, half go-kart, all balls. Nice. You're gonna bump those rich kids right off the track. And how are we on snack storage? Chip clip right there on the side. Chip clip! Yeah. Now, she's gonna handle like a bumper car. The steering's real loose, so don't be afraid to whip that wheel around real good. Yeah, yeah. You push the pedal and the thing goes. Wait till Bryce gets a load of this sweet ride. What is that? Are you jealous? (laughs) It doesn't sound like you are, but you will be once we race against you. You're not gonna race against me. What are you talking about? I'm in A-league. New cars start out in B-league. You got to win your way up to A-league. Are you kidding me? Nope. I'm serious-ing you. I'll be winning the Kingshead lsland Grand Prix when you're still figuring out which pedal is the gas and which is the brake. And the big round thing in the middle that steers it? That's your mom. Burn. Oh, that fart with a mouth? That's your face! (chuckles) Yeah, right. Announcer: Drivers, ten minutes till the B-league race. I guess that's us. Let's go tear up the B-league so we can blow it out Bryce's tailpipe. (sighs) Here we go. All: Wish me luck out there. Hmm? Wait, what do you mean wish you luck? 'Cause I'm driving. I thought I was driving. I thought we all thought I was driving. Oh, my God. Did we not talk about who's gonna drive? It's obviously me. But remember how good I was at that motorcycle arcade game? (beeping, engine revs) The point is to not burst into flames. Strongly disagree. Tina, you're not much better. Remember what happened when you drove the car in the parking lot? That was different. That was dirty driving. This is legal. Go-karting is good clean fun. There's only one way to settle this. Gene's hairy mole? Gene's hairy mole. Oh, boy. Ow. Ow. Ow! Hold 'em up. Yes! Uh, I mean... (groans) Whatever. I'm the driver. But, hey, it's all about the team. Right, sibs? Fair is fair, I guess. Go team. Yeah, Tina! That's the spirit! And you know what, I want you to be my water girl out there. How does that sound? Water girl instead of race kart driver? (gritting teeth): Hmm, let me think about that. Hey, when I win this race, it'll be like we all won. Especially me. T, give me a squirt. You missed. Did you do that on purpose? No. What a crazy water bottle. Oh, whoops. Uh, it's doing it again. Oh, sorry. (grunting) Hey! This is... this is crazy. (groans) Announcer: Drivers, start your engines. That guy can make a flag do anything he wants. But mostly flap around. (groans) Come on, you hunk of junk! Go straight! Now turn! Turn! You call that turning? The other way! Pretty good, kid. But can you Gus? Whoa. It's beautiful! Why is it called Gus? It's named after me. My name is Gus. A lot of people think the Gus comes from the wrists. It doesn't. It comes from in here. Your flask? Yes. And the heart. Without heart, you're just waving a flag around at the end of a little stick. Hey, maybe you've got what it takes to be a junior-Gus-in-training. I've waited my entire life to hear those exact words! That bumper-kart is terrible. We'll never win a race in that thing. Well, we might if, you know, you drove it like Critter told us to. What's that supposed to mean? Maybe it's not the kart's fault you slammed into all those walls and got turned around and drove the wrong way for an embarrassing amount of time. You think you can drive that thing? (scoffs) Be my guest. Take a lap. We're gonna go nice and easy. You lead, I'll follow. I know you want to bump into stuff but you can't. You're a race car now. You're all grown-up. That's it, Mr. Speedy. (tires screech) See? See what? How I took that turn instead of crashing like you did? Maybe I should be the one behind the wheel for Team Belcher? Tina, hello, it was my first race, okay? Back off. Besides, I won Gene's hairy mole fair and square. So let's speak of this no more. It's just, I could maybe win... Gene's hairy mole! I know. Gene's hairy mole. How's it coming? Teddy: Great. Once I'm done here, I'm gonna bring up another batch from the basement. Home brew in used bottles; I think we're getting good at this speakeasy thing. And all these sipsies are getting me tipsy. Eh, I had to hammer some of the caps back on and I used tape for a couple of 'em, but... I don't think anyone will notice. Uh, another "beer," please? Wink. Another one of the beers we normally sell here? Sure. Here you go. Whoa! Live one! Is he supposed to say "wink"? Or is he just supposed to wink? Well, we've been doing both. Oh... Oh, God. Oh, God! Bobby, the G-men are here! Turn the whole room around like they do in the movies! Quick, go! Ugh, no, no. Not now. Teddy, get out of here! Hurry. Hurry. Hugo! Bob. Ron. Bob. Ron! Oh. What's wrong with this picture, Ron? Uh... There are actually customers in here! Right. (sniffing) Smells... yeasty. (sniffing) I've never smelled this tangy... (sniffing) sour... yeast here before. Oh, uh, well, we have started baking bread, so maybe you're smelling the yeast from that. Yeah. And where is this yeasty bread, Bob? Uh, we, uh... we threw it away. It wasn't any good. No. Yeah. Terrible, terrible. It didn't come out, so... I mean, it was our first batch. You know? W-We're not... Who are we? You know? We're not bread experts. (chuckles) (chuckles) (chuckles) (chuckles) (chuckling) (sighs) Bread. Bob (loudly): Hugo, you really don't have to go down there! Hugo: So yeasty. Okay, you need to stop saying that word. It's making me uncomfortable. Oh, really? Yeasty, yeasty, yeasty. You know what I think, Bob? I think the bread story is a cover for what you're really doing. And what would that be? You're brewing your own beer! What?! That's crazy. What? (chuckles) It's crazy. Where would you get that? Beer. Who's brewing beer? What are... What is... what is this? What? Who is this guy? Beer. Pfft. You know, the only thing worse than an idiot who makes bacteria-infested home brew is a restaurant that serves it. Well, Hugo, there's no home brew here, so are we done with the inspection? (sniffs) I suppose. But know this, Bob, if I find out you are selling bacteria beer, you're going to get the triple smack-down. Smack one: I shut you down. Smack two: beer and wine license? Gone. Smack three? Tell 'em, Ron. Uh... You rot in hell, Bob! Hmm. Let's go, Ron. And I'll be back to try that bread, Bob. Great. 'Cause it's gonna be here, Hugo. Hugo: Oh, great! I'll bring my bread mouth! So I guess this means the speakeasy's over? Nothing's over, Teddy. Hugo can't stop us. All right, who knows how to bake bread? (engines rumbling) Flutter, flutter, flutter. Shimmy, shimmy, shimmy. And snap it off! Hell of a snap-off, Gene. Yeah, but my shimmy was shabby. I saw you drive that monstrosity the other day. It was impressive. Want to take a little walk and talk? I have a proposition for you. I'm taken. Well, it's complicated. Honey, if I was hitting on you, you'd know, because you'd be terrified. Trust me, you're hitting on me. Just come with us, please. My name is Sasha, and this is my racing team. Hi. Hi. So how'd you like to be a driver? Oh, I can't. My sister is our team's driver. She won the right to drive fair and square. Gene's hairy mole. It's this thing we do with... Oh, it's okay. I don't need to know. Listen, I'm not talking about you driving that thing. I'm talking about this. Tina: Whoa. Eddy, our usual driver, is in detention again. You'd be doing us a big favor if you drove the K.I.S. kart today. "Kiss"? No, K.I.S. It stands for Kingshead Island Speeders. Can I call it "kiss"? No. Listen to me. This is your chance to drive a real race kart, in the A-league. But I thought you had to win your way into the A-league. It's about the kart. This kart is already in the A-league. But why don't you want to drive the car yourself? Any kid can drive. I want to win. You think I can win? In A-league? If you can get that bumper-fart around the track in 70 seconds, imagine how fast you can go in this. (engine purring) Wow. You and this thing might actually have what it takes to knock Bryce off the top spot. He deserves to be beaten, by the way. He's a dirty driver. We call him Not Nice Bryce. I don't know. The bumper-kart is kind of a family project. Oh, sure, of course, yeah. You can just keep squirting water into your sister's mouth if you want. (grunting) Here, I made you this last-place medal. It's gum. Good one, Bryce. Joke's on you. I love old gum! Mmm. (gags) It's okay. He walked away. Tina, what are you wearing? A driver's jumpsuit. We've been through this, okay? Belcher Racing only has one driver, and that's me. I know. I'm driving for the Kingshead lsland Speeders. What?! I call it "kiss." How can you do that to us?! You're like a Belcherdict-Arnold! I was Team Belcher's best driver, but you didn't care if we won as long as you got to be the driver. That's crazy. You're crazy. Get out of that jumpsuit, get your water bottle and get back in the pit. I'm never going back to the pit unless the pit is a cool diner where teens hang out. Look, the A-league race is about to start. I got to go. You're in A-league?! Yeah, it's pretty cool. They give your go-kart a little wreath if you win. Oh, wow! Isn't that great? It is pretty great. Bye! Sasha: Hi, Tina. How are you doing? Good. 'Cause you're looking a little stiff out there, kiddo. Who's saying this? Sasha. I'm on the radio inside your helmet. Oh, 'cause I thought for a second you were... Oh, never mind. I'm not gonna tell you what I thought. Tina, you're driving like a water girl. Come on, cut it loose. All right, all right, I just need to get to know the car a little, I guess. Hello. You feel different than the bumper-kart. But I must feel different than your old driver, 'cause I have a girl butt, or so I'm told. I'm Tina, by the way. Tina, I'm gonna put you on mute. Okay. (engine revving) Whoa. You did that really well. Nice turning, wheels. And good job, steering wheel, too. And, uh, engine, you did your part. Second place! I knew it! I knew you were a racer! I got a little worried when you were talking to yourself and being really weird, but then you came through! It's okay! (laughs) This time second, next time beat Bryce. Louise: Tina, can you pass me a napkin? And try not to betray it. Louise, please pass the pepper. And try not to crash it into the salt. Why don't you try to remember where that pepper came from? From here, from this apartment, from this family. So that's where pepper comes from. Girls, you two need to stop all this. You're both go-kart drivers now. And you're not even racing against each other, right? That's right. I'm in the A-league. Well, I'm coming for you, T. If I finish the season in first place in the B-league, then I get a spot in the Kingshead lsland Grand Prix. You do? Yup. And that's when I get to beat you. But you have to actually win races to finish in first place. Maybe you didn't totally understand that. (chuckles): Oh, keep it up. Way ahead of you. Literally. (growls) Look, I know there's this rumor that Tina's a better driver, and I think you started it, but you and me are gonna work real hard, and we're gonna win some races.     (Louise whoops loudly) Ha, ha! Looks like I'll be seeing you at the Grand Prix, sis. And I'll be seeing you from the first place podium. Also, I'll see you at home, and also in the car, 'cause we should probably carpool to the race. Yup, yup, got it! I hit the gas, and I drive away! It's weird how you freshly baked the staleness right into them. It's-it's an old family secret. Another cold one, Bob. Hey, Bob, that bun doesn't look like this bun, Bob. You trying to screw me? I want the fresh-baked buns. I want the fresh-baked buns. So, you're not using these buns on your burgers? Suspicious. Gretchen? Move on. We're-we're making buns for, uh, um, uh... For what? Uh, the buns are for... For breakfast! Yes. We're gonna start breakfast now. Hmm. Breakfast at Bob's. I can't wait to come by and try it. 6:00 a.m. sound good? I mean, well, we haven't really talked about when we're opening yet, so... Okay, see you at 6:00 then. And you better have sausages, Bob! We'll have it! Bob: So, this is what the kids have been up to? I had no idea it was, like, you know, actual racing. It is a beautiful day for racing. Hey, want a hit? Sure. Thanks, Crit. Mmm, this homebrew of yours is oh so refreshing. Your bread is, uh... Whoop, hey, there it goes! Got away from me there. Sorry about that. Uh, you-you kind of threw it. Oh, yeah. Right. So it didn't get away from you. You threw it. No, it's bad. I was trying to spare your feelings, but if you want to address it, it's not very good bread. No, I get it. No. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess I got it right away. I just thought... forget it. Yeah. Unnecessary little confrontation here. Gene, you've been oddly enthusiastic about flag waving these last couple weeks. I thought you were just messing with me, but you were serious. Very serious. Then, well, there's something I want to ask you. Oh, my God, you're dying! I'll take over for you! What? No, I'm not dying. For now. I'm not dying. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Okay. I was gonna ask you if you wanted to flap your first grand prix. (gasps) I would be honored! I'll wave your flag, Gus, but I'll never replace you. Right, I-I know. Just to clarify, it's only one race. We'll see. Guys, huddle up. Cookie toast. Tina, bring it home for us. Uh, hey, Rico, these cookies are ten dollars each. You're eating them like they're five dollars each. Sorry. Can I have a cookie? I'll put a cookie on the finish line. But what if someone drives over it? That someone will be you. Then I can't eat it. Ugh. Great. Bryce. You here, me no like. Pasta salad on your kart. Ugh! (laughs) Don't you put pasta salad on my kart! Announcer: Drivers, two minutes to the start of the Grand Prix! I'm gonna beat you! I'm gonna beat Tina! I'm gonna beat all you Richie Riches! Not likely, especially because of that. Aw, crap. Flick, flick. It's a blown pump. I don't have my tools, but maybe I can rig something. Announcer: Drivers, to the starting line! I don't know if we're gonna make it! We'll make it! We'll make it! What's going on? It looks like you have one less competitor to beat. But I don't want to beat her this way. Today, you beat her this way. Tomorrow, you beat her that way. All that matters is today you beat her this way. Drivers, start your engines! (grunts) There! Now you're gonna leak some oil, but you just might make it around! Thanks, Critter. Oh, and a wheel mighfall off. What? What?! Nothing! Get out of your head! Did you fix it or not, Critter?! Let's say I did. Go, go, go! (tires screeching) Come on, bumper-kart! Hold it together! You got this! How you doing out there? Well, I'm torn between the desire to win and my love for my sister. Forget it. Bye. Bye. Atta girl. Let's beat these snobs! Yeah! Uh-huh!  Every day...  (engine revving) All right! (whooping) Gene, it's white flag time. Last lap coming up! It's now or never, Tina. Make your move! Pass him! Aah! Oh, come on! Hey! That's not nice, Bryce! Oh, I get it now. Aah! That's it! (tires screeching) What?! So long, Bryce. I kartly knew you. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Go! Come on, Bryce, get it together. That's Tina and Louise out in front. Come on, girls! Win this thing! Oh, my God. I assumed they'd both lose. What if one of them wins and beats the other? Dibs on not handling it! Checkered flag time! They're coming in! Gene, do the double! I'm not ready! Easy, easy. Deep breath. Let it flow from within you. Here they come! (tires screeching) Son of a b1tch! Sasha: Yes! The Grand Prix is ours! Go Team K.I.S. No, go Team Belcher. Excuse me? What are you talking about? (thud) Are you crazy? You're helping another team win?! Sorry, Sasha. It's a family thing. (grunting) He's Gussin'! What are you doing?! Helping you win! You should win! You're the better driver. You should win. You worked really hard to get here. I guess, but... Oh, I just won. Nice flag-waving, Gene! I did it! I did it! I waved that flag! (whoops) Yay, kids! Yes! Yes, kids! (whoops) Yeah, that's the way to do it! Belchers! Belchers! Belchers... No one? No one. Are you done yet, Hugo? Look, Bob, we both know you're slinging homebrew. And if my supervisor wasn't saying, "I'm going to fire you if you waste any more time on that case," I'd nail you for it. That said... the sausages are good. Let's go, Ron! Hey, can I get a box for my pancake half? Just stuff it into your mouth! It's half a bite! (doorbells jingle) BOB: We got to stop. We can't keep this up. Oh, thank God. I'm so bloated and tired. Somebody's gonna have to tell Teddy. Dibs on not telling him! Dibs on not... Damn it! How do you talk so fast? Tina: Vroom. Oh, good turn. Vroom. Tina? Tina? You're-you're driving in your sleep again. Oh, sorry. Yeah. I know it's like we both won, but maybe we both don't need to sleep with the trophy, huh? (sighs) Okay, one more night. Okay, one more week. Sweet dreams. (making engine noises)  Racing with the road  Racing with the road  Racing with the road  Racing with the road  Race  Fast  Race  Fast  Race  Fast  Race  Fast  Race... 
Niagara ketchup! I don't get it. Oh, like Niagara Falls, but with ketchup? No! Oh, yes. Kids, stop. You love Niagara ketchup! Admit it! You want to get in a barrel and be part of it! Bob: No. Dad, are you still mad about the zester? Yes, of course I'm mad. You zested gum off Gene's shoe. Yeah. It's called being a good sister. But now it's ruined. You can never un-zest this. Can't we get another zester? Not like this one. It was perfect. I had more zest for this zester than I do for life. It was simply the zest. Ha, ha! Too soon. Yeah. Hey, Mike. You got some bills, and this one feels really weird if you squeeze it. Oh, my God! A letter from the community garden! Please let it say I'm accepted. Open it. Open it. Open it. Open it! “Dear Mr. Belcher, we regret to inform you...” Damn it! Aw! Oh, they sent a packet of seeds. Consolation seeds. I've been there. Why would they send those? I don't know, Tina. I guess to remind me of the beautiful place that exists that I'll never get to be a part of! Like the boys locker room. Or New York in the '90s! Cheer up, Bobby. We could get you a little planter box to hang from the window. It's not the same, Lin. It's not just about growing a few things. It's about working the land, growing produce for the restaurant. If we had a yard, I'd do it there, but we don't. Get off your high horse. Why don't you grow some alley pumpkins? I want land! I'm a gardener trapped in the body of an urban restaurateur. I have ground beef under my fingernails, but it should be... ground beef and dirt! Ugh. Mike, I know you're just the mailman, but I can't help thinking you did this. Sure, blame me for this, but you never thank me for the letters I don't deliver. Thank you. Bye-bye. There must be something I can do to get in. You know what? I'm gonna walk down there and talk to the garden master. Oh, Cynthia? Good luck with that piece of work. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Cynthia as in Logan's mom? As in Logan, my archenemy?! Yeah. Tell her to tell Logan he's a... (blows raspberry). And his head looks like... (blows raspberry). And his face sounds like... (blows raspberry). He'll know what it means. I, uh... I probably won't do that, Louise. Do you want me to write it down then? Um, yeah, go ahead. You know, do what you got to do, Bobby. If you have to sleep with her to get in, it's okay. I don't like her, but whatever it takes. Way ahead of you, Lin. (birds chirping) It's so... perfect. Can I help you? Oh. Hi, Cynthia. (sighs): Oh. So, um, uh, it's been a while since we were all in my restaurant with all those bikers. With all of those dirty bikers your daughter hired to cut off my son's ears. And that baby was born. Weird day! Right! But we don't... we don't have to reminisce about that. Wait. Does that have anything to do with me not getting accepted to the garden? (chuckles): Oh, of course not! Bygones. Well, my application was rejected again, and I was wondering if maybe I filled it out wrong. I did make a few jokes. Like where it asked, “What are your hobbies?” I wrote, “Beets me!” Get it? Spelled B-E-E-T. Ugh! Logan! It was an accident! Gah! It's hot! He probably likes it! Ugh, sorry, Bob. He's not... We're working on it. No, no, he's a... he's a great kid. (scoffs) No, he's not, but he will be. I'm trying to get him into this college prep summer program, but he doesn't have enough extracurricular activities. Like, uh, volunteering? (scoffs) Volunteering. Everyone's doing that. You can't throw a rock without hitting a kid volunteering at a hospice. Oh, I hate those kids who volunteer at hospices. The newest thing is crappy jobs that build character. You want to stand out, you write an essay about that. Oh. What qualifies as a crappy job? I don't know. Like sweeping stuff or mopping something. You know, just some dead-end job in a horrible place. I know a dead-end job in a horrible place! (doorbells jingle) Bob: Say hello to the newest member of the community garden! Hello. All right! Congrats, Dad. You did it, you old son of a b1tch! And say hello to our newest employee! Logan? No! Dad! Uh-huh. Uh-uh. Uh-huh! Uh-uh! Uh-huh! Uh-uh! Uh-huh! Uh-uh! Uh-uh! Uh, uh, uh! Uh, uh, uh! See? You two are already enjoying working together. (laughs): Okay, you got me. It's a joke. You'd never really hire Logan. It's just temporary, Louise. Logan's mom was nice enough to find me a plot at the community garden, because... Because he gave me this crappy job. It's not crappy. Don't-don't say that. But if your mom asks, it's-it's crappy. Wait. You're paying this butt brain? My butt does have brains. They're called turds, and they're smarter than you. No, it's an unpaid internship. Finally, we're getting a little more sausage at this party. Yes, Gene. This is a terrible idea, Dad. You've taken the only good thing about this restaurant... its lack of Logan- and you added Logan! That is not appropriate for the workplace. You are not appropriate for the workplace! You're not appropriate for your face! (groaning) (both groaning, blowing raspberries) I bet when you reconnect in your 30s, you guys will get married. Bob, if they're gonna just fight the whole time, he's not gonna be much help. Bob: Just let them get it out of their system. It's almost like they're playing. I'm okay with him. I can pick his brain about mid-teen boys. Find out what tickles their pits. That's a great attitude, Tina. Louise, can I see you in the kitchen real fast? Louise, I really, really want this garden. Plus, it will be good for all of us. We're gonna grow fresh produce for the restaurant. Doesn't that sound great? Dad, I'm nine. I spit out vegetables and hide them around the house. Louise, please, can you at least try and get along with Logan? Just for a little while? Do it for me? Fine. Great! Thanks. But the first time he even... (sighs) Okay, I'm off to the garden! Is that my sun hat? Uh, yeah. Can I borrow it? I guess, but you look like a British lady. I know. Thanks. Bye. Oh, my dirt. My sweet, sweet, sweet dirt. Hello, trowel. You're gonna be digging. Hello, shears. You're gonna be trimming. I was so smart to buy you guys five years ago. Everyone said, "You don't have a garden. Why are you buying gardening equipment?" And I said, “I'll grow into it.” (chuckles) Trowel? Right? Uh, sorry. I-I didn't see... I thought I was alone. Okay, Logan, fellow employee, this is the spot I've chosen for you to stand in for the rest of the day. It's out of the way, we won't have to smell or hear you, and when it's time to punch out, there's the door. Oh, you're gonna smell me. Smell it. Take in the aroma. (chuckles) High five. Wow, that was hard! I never knew high-fiving was so violent and satisfying! My hand is a man now! Your hand is a bro. It is? Let's bro again. (grunts) Ow! Oh, yeah. Gene! What? Everyone getting along out there? You know it, Linda. I'm in the mile- high-five club. Sounds great. Maybe I wasn't clear, Logan. You stand in your spot, face the wall, silently, till it's time to go home, and everything will be fine. The way I see it, as long as your dad wants his garden, I can do whatever I feel like. What? Yeah. Maybe I'll go back to this. Oh, somebody order a cup of cheese? 'Cause that's what it smells like. (yells) Come on, Logan. Let's-let's go in the back, and I'll show you how to wash the dishes. Uh, we-we can dish about the washing. (chuckles) So, uh, what do high school boys talk about? Follow-up question. Do you talk about it in the shower after you do sports? Additional follow-up question. How hot is the water? Does it produce steam? I'm asking for a friend. Yeah, that's classified, top-secret guy stuff, so... Right, right, right, right. And towels- how small are they? Like washcloth size? Uh... Smaller? (sighs) I'll start folding this. You say when. Huh? Huh? Mm. Uh. Huh? Ah... Like, what... I can't even fold it more. Hey, Mom, how you doing? Good. So, are we really sure this Logan thing is worth it? I mean, Dad's a family member, but he's ranked, like, fourth or fifth. Louise, it's not that bad. Plus, your father needs this. And you owe him one. You de-zested his zester. Let him have the garden. (groans) Sometimes you just got to be around people you don't like. Oh, look at this place. Oh, God, it's her. Oh, it's even more depressing than I remembered. How dare she. Oh, hi, Linda. I'm just here to help Logan with his essay. Don't mind me. Oh, I won't, Cynthia. What were you saying, Mother? (whispers): Something about people you don't like? Just pretend like I'm not here. Oh, but could I just get a chamomile tea? I'm sorry, we don't have that. Oh. Okay. Well, then just bring me some hot water. And a lemon and some chamomile tea. Oh, right, you don't have that. That's just... so weird. Anyway, hot water and lemon would be great. Fine. Ew. Sticky. Logan? Logan! What?! I'm starting your essay we're gonna say you wrote! Come out here and sweep something so I can write about it! (grumbling) (grumbling) Well, good night. Good night. Okay, Bob, I'm just gonna say it. I know you love that garden, but now Cynthia's hanging out at the restaurant, ordering tea. (screams) Hi. If I could just jump in here, I don't know if I can take Logan much longer before I slap that mess. Yeah, how long is this gonna last, Bob? Uh, probably just until Logan gets into that summer program thing, and then we're home free. Rolling in arugula. So just try and ignore Cynthia and Logan. Start slapping faces, got it. No! No slapping. Just ignoring. Fine. But just so you know, I got this guy and this guy, and they're ready to go to work. Look at you. It's only been a few days, and you're so big! (high-pitched): We know. And soon, you'll be ready to get eaten. (high-pitched): What? Nothing. I didn't say anything. I for... I forgot you could understand me, spoke English. I'm gonna tickle you now. Huh? Huh? (high-pitched laughing) (high-pitched): Oh, stop! Stop!  Tomatoes and sweet peas and green beans  It's a dream come true  I wanna take her stupid neck  And wring it  That's what I want to do, too, but with him  The only thing greener than these plants is my thumb  How did we ever get stuck with these bums?  The restaurans now a crappy place  I think I found my happy place  I'm like a British Lady in my garden  And my plants agree    Mm-hmm!  He's the most annoying person that was ever born  Oh, God, she brought her own tea  I'm the world's greatest farmer  Things are growing so well  We're living in our own personal hell  The restaurant's now a crappy place  I think I found my happy  The restaurant's now a crappy, crappy, crappy, crappy  Happy, happy, happy, happy  Place.  (burps, blows air) Ooh, windy in here, huh? Stop it! (burps, blows air) Ew! Something should close the door, huh? Stop it! High school age boys- they're a handful. Handful of this. (grunts) Gene! Sorry. "These simple people were doing the best they could "with what little they had in their sad, underperforming restaurant"? Hey, don't read that! “Simple people”? It's just an expression. It's for the essay. You know what, Cynthia? Nope. Do it for Bobby, do it for Bobby. Uh-oh, we got a low-pressure system moving in from the north and a warm front moving in from the south. (burps, blows air) Stink-a-cane! Son of a b1tch! Take shelter! Is “slop shop” one word or two? You know what you should write about? A very violent event involving your computer and a simple lady who snapped! Kids, get a mop! You're about to clean Cynthia's laptop off the floor! Oh, yeah. Let's do this! Hands, time to get slappy. (exclaiming) Wha...? Hi everyone. How are things... going? Interesting but scary. Everything's going great! I was just about to proofread Cynthia's essay with my foot. And I was just gonna use my hands to make a Logan face sandwich. (both grunting) Okay, uh, good. Cynthia, hello. Logan, hey. So, uh, you know, a few bumps in the road are to be expected. This is more than a few bumps, Bob. This was a bad idea. Kiss your garden good-bye. Logan, we're leaving! Good! Great! Bye. Whoa, whoa, w-wait, wait. Where are you going? Yeah, Dad. Don't. Let them go. I'll, uh... I'll handle this. Look, I-I'm sure we can figure this out. Is-is there anything I can do to fix this? I-I will do anything to make this work. I love your son. Look at Dad. He's really laying into them. Gene: Maybe I should go out there and hold him back. Nah, I don't think so. Linda: Aw, big papa bear Bobby looking out for his cubs. You get 'em. Louise: I'm just glad this nightmare on Logan Street is over. There's got to be something we can do that will make you happy, make me happy, make your essay happy. All right, Bob. You told them off. Good job. Yeah, well, uh... Did you hear someone yelling, “Please Hammer, don't hurt 'em”? That was me. Uh, yeah, yeah. Good. I thought you were gonna keep taking that doofus's side, then I saw you out there, and damn it if you didn't make me proud. Uh, okay. Um, a little news to share, everyone. Uh, a-after a lot of consideration, I've decided to make Logan... employee of the month. What?! Bob! Wow. He hasn't even been here a week. Good for him. N-Now, hear me out. Louise... Ow, ow. You're hurting me. Ow, ow! Aw, Bob. (coughs) Oh, my kidneys. You're so small, but you're so strong. Him or me, Dad! It's for the greater good, Louise. Okay. I see. All right. (coughing) Oh, thank God. I quit! Damn it, I thought the glass would break. Anyway, I quit! The glass didn't break. High five! Great, Bobby. Great job! So Louise can quit? Quitting is an option? I want to quit. It would be fun to quit if I didn't love this job so gosh darn much. Nobody's quitting. Louise didn't quit. She's just going on a sabbatical. Great. I'll do that. No, only one sabbatical a year, Gene. And I'm taking mine next. Mm. This is not a big deal. I'm gonna go talk to Louise. Louise? Sweetheart? Sweet Pea? I know I don't call you that, but maybe we should start calling you that. I'll do that. Sweet Pea, how you doing in there? Louise: Perfect! Louise, making Logan employee of the month doesn't mean anything. I know it doesn't, because we've never done it before. Hey, I have a great idea. What if we make you employee of the month next month? I mean, Tina, technically should really be next; She works so much harder than you. Never mind. We'll make an exception for you. But Tina will be crushed. Sounds super, super great! Can't wait, Dad! Okay, good. So, good talk, right? Aw, the best. Good first step. (groans) Uh, thanks for participating. Love you... Cutie Pie? Ugh. Sorry. I'll think of a better one than Cutie Pie. You're my Angel Dust. Sorry, that's a drug. I'm gonna go. Bye. Louise. When are you coming down? Mom has a stain on her apron. You're missing so much. How'd you get this number? Mom writes it on my leg every morning in case I get lost. Oops. I better sweep this up. Keep talking about whatever you're talking about. It doesn't have to be about your changing bodies, but it could be. Go. So are you coming down or what? I miss you! Oh I'll see you soon, Gene. (chuckles) But you won't see me. If Dad won't fire Logan, oh, I'm gonna make Logan wish Dad would've never hired him. Okay, bye. Oh, my God. Today was supposed to be overcast. No, it's a beautiful day. Shorts weather. Oh, no. No, no, no. What, Bob? I-I didn't cover my beans. You didn't cover your beans? It was supposed to be overcast! They're gonna die! Aah! I got to save the beans! Go! Damn it, Bob, you're frickin' nuts. Go! I'll be back in five minutes! Hey Scotty. Jacob. What's up? You liking those fries, brah? On me, my friends. I do whatever I want around here. 'Cause I'm employee of the month, so... Ow! What the... Who did that? Hey. Damn it. (quietly): Just spitballin' here. (laughs) Linda, I just need one photo of him with this employee of the month plaque in the restaurant. And maybe a few of him taking out the trash. Eh, why don't I take out the trash instead? Uh, bup, bup, bup, bup. I-I'm taking the photo. Dup, dup, dup, dup. No, you don't. Bob and I have a deal. Deal with this, honey. Oh, my face! Ow, my face! Okay, we're good. You guys are good, right? (high-pitched): Thanks, Bob. We were hot and scared. Oh, I'm sorry, guys. (high-pitched): Tell us a joke. No, I-I... I got to get back. (high-pitched): Please? Just one? All right, just one. A kid's playing in a sandbox and he finds a welding mask. (high-pitched laugh) No, wait, there... that's not the end. It's more. (high-pitched): Oh. Okay, a kid's playing in a sandbox. (high-pitched laugh) Who's hitting me with spitballs?! (gasps) Invisible spitball ninja. Logan, you got something on your face right there. (grunts) Stop it! Oh, and also right there. Logan: Louise, I know it's you. Where are you? Louise: I'm in your mind, Logan. There's a lot of room in here. (chuckles) Oh, I'm gonna find you. And I'm gonna get you. And I'm gonna... (gags, coughs) My uvula! Employee of the mouth! (grunts) Linda, control your daughter! Ow! Hey! Ha, ha. Good news. The green beans are doing all right. Oh, you and that garden. You smell like dirt and fresh air. And it makes me sick! Ow! Your daughter's gone nuts, by the way. She's in the crawlspace sh**ting spitballs at everybody. Louise, get out of there. Louise: No! Not until you fire Logan. Ow! Hey. Louise, you come out of there right now. I don't want to do this, but you're not gonna be the next employee of the month; You're gonna be the last employee of the month, even after Gene! Sorry, Gene. Sorry for what? I wasn't listening. And I'm not gonna fire Logan; I'm keeping the garden, and you're gonna deal with it, Louise, because it's good for all of us. And not to bring up the zester again, but the zester. You owe me. And let me tell you something. Spending time in the garden has helped me realize a few things. We need to go outside more, okay? Why don't we go on walks? As a whole society? People should go out on walks! And people should garden! Bob? I hate to interrupt your flow. Great speech though, great speech. Yeah, it really got going after a while. Uh, Dad? Yes? We're not going on walks, are we? I don't know. Maybe. Anyway, while you were talking to the wall, Louise snuck in and took off with your gardening shears. What? Yeah. She looked ready to use them, too. I wonder on what. What could it beans? Oh, my God, my garden! Louise, just stop, okay? I get it, you're mad. Also, I'm getting a cramp. Oh, no! Better stop and stretch it out! Louise, you're literally running with scissors. Really big scissors. I know, it feels great! (panting) (fence rattles) Oh, good, it's closed. Louise, it's over! Come on, let's go home. (grunts) Oh, crap. (grunts) Ow. God, how small are you? Say good-bye to your crappy crops. Ha! Don't have to. You don't know which plot is mine, Louise. Is it the one with the paper plate sign that says Bob's Beauties? No. No, no, no, no. You... Louise, you don't have to do this! You didn't have to hire Logan either. Louise, please. Those are my babies. What? These. These are your babies? Yes. Those are... Oh. Yeah. Why did I... say that in front of my actual baby? Yeah! Right. Yeah, so maybe this whole garden thing was a little selfish. Yeah, I noticed how the greater good meant doing the thing you like to do. You're right. You know what? Do it. Cut them. Cut them down. What? Really? Yeah, do it. I deserve it. I can't watch. I can't. It's not their fault. That's right. It's my fault. So I'm gonna cut you. What? Just kidding. (chuckles) I know. Look, I'm sorry I hired Logan. I-I know how much you don't like him. Yeah, I'm pretty open about that, Dad. Plus, I mean, the restaurant is our place. And I like it that way. I know you do. I mean, sort of. I had a suspicion. But you do hide it pretty well. Thank you. I'm sorry I put my sweet peas before my Sweet Pea. Is that nickname thing working at all now? No. Can you forgive me anyway? Under one condition. You're fired! What? She can't fire me. Right? Of course she can't. Yeah, I think she just did. Louise is actually our human resources person now. And I'm executive vice president of new business! Oh, man, I've just been bussing tables. Logan, if you need a recommendation, here's one: Put a bag on your face. I'll put a bag on your face. Okay, hon, I'm gonna have security walk you out now. No. Well, I hope you enjoyed your last trip to the garden, Bob. Because it was your last trip. I know. That's why I dug up all my plants and brought them home. And I used your wheelbarrow. My... You're not allowed to use that. It already happened. There's nothing you can do about it. And I broke the lock on your gate. (gasps) Which I will replace. Which is what you should do with your eggplant. It looks leggy. Logan, let's go. You're all nuts. Uh-huh, so if you want to sh**t me your e-mail, I can just send you the rest of my boy questions. Absolutely not. "Absolutely not" at what .com? Bye, Cynthia. I spilled water on your laptop. Aw, she didn't hear me. She'll figure it out. Looking a little cramped. Yeah, we probably should've just planted one. Oh, no! Oh, God! Bob:  Tomatoes and sweet peas and green beans  It's a dream come true  Linda:  I want to take her stupid neck and ring it  Louise:  That's what I want to do, too, but with him  Bob:  The only thing greener than these plants is my thumb  Linda and Louise:  How did we ever get  Stuck with these bums?  The restaurant's now a crappy place  Bob:  I think I found my happy place  I'm like a British lady in my garden, and my... 
Tina: (sighs) Another D on a math test. And if I don't get at least a B on the next one, I've got to go to remedial math. (groans) Remedial math, huh? On your first day in there, steal the biggest kid's pencil. Yeah, and then sharpen it and give it back. What'll I tell my grandchildren? I used to be bad at math. Oh, Grandma. I'm not going to remedial math, because I'm going to get a tutor who will teach me what my teacher could not. I don't know why we're getting yelled at. You know what's this weekend, Bobby? Valentine's Day. Oh, crap. I-I mean, I-I don't mean crap, Lin. I-I know you love Valentine's Day, I just feel like I never get it quite right. No, you do not. No, you're horrible at it. Well, I mean, a couple times, I got you something nice. Remember I got the oil change? Right. For the car? Right, yeah. That was for you. You did that, that was nice. Yeah. This year, you don't have to worry, 'cause I got it all figured out.  Ta-da!  Wow. What is it? It's a Valentine's Advent calendar. This year we're doing Valentine's Days. Valentine's Days? Say good-bye to the pressure of being super-romantic on one day, and say hello to being somewhat-romantic for a bunch of days leading up to the big V. Yeah! Behind each little door is a romantic activity that I've already thought of. Oh, you planned stuff. That's right! Huh, all right, uh, that sounds better. Right? Open up day one, Bobby. Come on, (stammers) l-let me open it. No. Teddy, get off it! Come on, let me open it. Teddy, Teddy, give it... Just let me open it, you can open up the other days. Teddy, let it go. Okay, uh... "Sexy cooking." Sexy cooking... I knew it. Yeah. I don't exactly know what that means, but if it means I'm not gonna screw up Valentine's Day, then I am in. I love it. We're in. Darryl: Rosa. Rosa, Rosa. Darryl! Huh?! What? I need your help... could you tutor me at math? Not taking on new clients. All my post-tutoring, pre-video-game free time is going to robotics. I'm building a companion robot for my grandpa. It gives him pills and plays jazz. But if I don't get help, I've got to go to remedial math. Ooh, that's tough. Good luck. Wait, what about tutoring me on Saturday? I'm not going to the Valentine's Day dance, so maybe... And you assume because I'm a nerd, I'm not going, either? What? Oh, I'm sorry, I assumed you weren't going for a totally different reason. Yeah, I'm not going. (gasps) That's it... double nerd. Huh? Come with me, we got to talk in private. I'll tutor you if you'll be my date to the Valentine's dance. Oh, Darryl, I'm flattered, but I'm semi-involved with someone... Jimmy Jr. He's semi-not-involved with me right now, but we're working through it. No, I don't really want to go to the dance with you. I want to go with Rosa Batista. Then why don't you ask Rosa? I can't... she's out of my league. I'm in seventh grade, she's in eighth. I think she still sees me as the little boy that peed down the slide in second grade. Oh, that was you? I heard it was off a swing. (sighs) Some of it may have gotten on the swing. But listen, do you remember who won Cupid's Couple at last year's seventh-eighth grade Valentine's dance? Um, Michael Carlish and Tracy Schwartz, right? And after they broke up, seventh-grade Michael Carlish started dating eighth-grade... Both: Jenny Testa. Whoever wins Cupid's Couple can date anyone they want when they break up. If we fake-date, we could win. And then if we fake break-up, I could date Rosa, and you could date Jimmy Jr. Hmm, but why would students vote you and me to be Cupid's Couple? Because of the double-nerd angle. I'm not a nerd. You kind of are. I'm not. We'll be too adorable to lose. A negative times a negative is a positive. That can't be right. We'll cover that in tutoring. So, do we have a deal? Uh... Feels kind of wrong to mess with love. We'd have to be careful. I've seen enough romantic comedies to know you're probably gonna fall for me. I won't fall for you. Okay, it's just that you're probably gonna fall for me. Don't. I won't. Good, fight that feeling. I won't need to. Okay, fake boyfriend, let's fake do this. (anxious sigh) Your hand is sweaty like a forehead. I know. It's an issue. Oh, my God, are you two a couple now? You do the math. No. Um, yeah, we are. Well, nibble my dibble. How long have y'all been going out? A month. Since today. Uh, since today, but earlier. (chuckles) I never really thought about either of you that much, but you guys make a cute couple. Yeah, it's like neither of you are cute, but together you're cute. We're both humans who wear glasses! Whoa, volume, Darryl. Yeah, man, we're right here. You all right, buddy? Darryl, sweetie, will you come with me for a sec and check my hair for lice? Mmm-okay. We'll be right back. Ah, I'm losing so much water out of my palms! I'll be dead by morning! Pull it together, Darryl! Maybe I was wrong about this. I don't know how to be a boyfriend. You haven't dated anyone. And I've only dated two-and-a-half boys, but I've thought about boys and relationships a lot. Mm-hmm. Like, a lot. Uh-huh. I mean, a lot. Okay. So, how about this? You'll be my math tutor, and I'll be your boyfriend tutor. Okay. Like, if you don't know what to say, just give me a tiny side-hug. Uh...? Um, oh, God. Okay, um, not like that. Ah...? Decent hug, but do it silently next time. Good news, neither of us have lice. So, hello again, everyone. Aw, you guys look so cute together. Thanks, Rosa. You're welcome. (chuckles) B-Bye. B-Bye. Oh, bye. Bye. Are Darryl and Tina holding hands? Tina hasn't pined after Darryl for one second. And that girl can pine. Hey, Lin, can you take this to table four? Aah! What the hell was that? Sexy cooking. Oh, okay, right. She got ya! Whipped cream. Sexy, right? Very. Teddy. Uh, now's not really the best time, Lin. Come here. It's the lunch rush. Come on, come on. Also, can you take that burger to table four? I could, or you can try and find the strawberry I've hidden somewhere on my body. Wh-What are you talking about?  Find the strawberry  Strawberry trail  Mmm, no.  Yeah.  I don't know. Not right now. Wait, is that it, right there? In your apron pocket? Mm-hmm. So it's in there. Yeah, come and get it. Well, it's all dirty now, 'cause it's in your apron with a dirty dishrag. So dirty. Hurry up, it's getting all mushy. Well, I don't really want to now, it has a dishrag on it. Sure you do. I really don't. I don't want that one. You know you want to. No. Open up... Mm-mm, mm-mm. Open up. No. Fine, I'll take a nibble. Mmm. (gags) Lin, you're gagging. (groans) Tina, hey, back from tutoring, I see. Have a seat, my sister. Sure. So, Darryl, boyfriend, you, girlfriend? Mm-hmm. Really? Really. Okay, you broke me! Darryl and I are pretending we're dating so we can win Cupid's Couple at the dance, and then we can go out with whoever we want, and I stay in normal math. I knew math was responsible! Please don't tell. If anyone knows we're faking, then we won't win. Right. Bribe, please. (sighs) Okay. Well, the winners of Cupid's Couple get a $50 frozen yogurt gift card. I guess you guys can have that if we win. Shh... You had me at "gets a $50 frozen yogurt gift card." Now, a boyfriend should always give his girlfriend compliments. Like, you could tell me I did a great job of opening my locker on the first try. I should compliment you on that? Especially that. My locker has a mind of its own, which I respect, but also sometimes I just need to get my books. Uh, okay. Hey, great job opening your locker on the first try, Tina. Oh, thanks. Whoa, that is some sweet talk. I know, right? It's so cute how their glasses reflect off each other. Yeah, like two mirrors that go on forever. Infinite stuff trips me out! Oh, no, there's a spider on your back. Ew! Get it off! Get it off! No, it's not real, it's my hand. It's a cute game we play, it's our thing. But I hate spiders, could it be a beetle? Sure. Oh, no. There's a beetle on your back. (chuckles) Aw! Bugs are, like, the new hugs. Cupid sure hit that couple right in the rump, huh? It's the romance of the century! And it has nothing to do with yogurt. I'm having a really good time with you tonight. I don't think everyone heard you. You got to yell over the music. Oh, right. (louder): I'm having a really good time with you tonight. Oh, man, look at Chloe and Zack slow dance. They are so slow! Wow, they're barely moving. How do we compete with that? We cannot let them win Cupid's Couple. Hold on, I got a good idea. Hey, who's having a great Valentine's Day? (shouting in affirmation) Well, I'm having a greater time, because I'm here with the number one girlfriend in the world. Ti-na Bel-cher! Hi. Aw, I want someone to stretch out my name like that. Joce-lynn...! Deejay, slow-jam me.  Girl  I wish you were  In all my classes  And when we kiss  We hit our glasses  Now let's  Slow dance  Like mol... asses...    Thank you, good night! Aw... Wow, Darryl, where did that come from? Girlfriends like surprises. You taught me that. Hey, you know what might push us over the top right now? A kiss. Great idea. Let's make this look real. (whooping, applause) Wow, who knew Darryl was total boyfriend material? I know. I didn't know, but now I know, you know? We're gonna win this thing. We should probably kiss one more time. Just in case someone was tying their shoes and missed it. Right, good thinking. (Darryl moans) So are you ready to see what we got for actual Valentine's Day? I don't know if I am ready. It's, uh, it's been a rough week. Yeah. We've had some misfires. And an actual fire, yeah. Yeah. Ooh, "Bubble Bath"! Well, it's hard to mess up a bubble bath. And Gene and Louise are asleep, so that sounds good. Oh, Bobby. Oh, hello, there. Get in here, you. It's nice and bubbly. Yeah, there's a lot of bubbles. Yeah, I used the whole bottle. You used the whole bottle? You're supposed to use, like, a teaspoon. It's, like, toxic. No. All right, fine, fine, it's fine. It's just a lot of bubbles. Come on, it's fun. It's like a paste in here. Yeah, right?! Feels like no water. Look at that. Oh. Let's just go with it. Yeah. But it stings. Just ignore it. Yeah, when it gets in your eyes, it stings. Ignore it. Come on, look at me. I'm just gonna get out for a sec, Lin. No... I got to wash my face off. Gene! Ooh! I thought you were asleep. I thought I was, too. But then my bladder was, like, "Get up!" (yawns) What's going on in here? Oh, God, no, Louise, you got to get out. I'm peeing, but after, I'm gonna make a sandwich and join Mom and Dad in the tub. Ooh, what kind of sandwich? N-No, Lin, no. Well, now I got to pee. Use the second toilet. Mom, Dad, can you get out for a second? Do you pee in here? Yeah. You're kidding me. Well, no. I'm in it. Well, I... that's why I'm asking you to please get out for just a minute. Couple three. (light applause) And couple four. (applause) All right, looks like the winner of Cupid's Couple is... Darryl and Tina! Don't fly away, because you get a $50 gift card to Fro-Yo-Momma. We did it. I know. Girls are smiling at me. The theorem's working. Let's kiss one more time to seal the deal. We already won. Where's Rosa? I can't see Rosa. And one more time, for old time's sake. All right, well, I... Okay one more. I guess... Wait, that... let's redo that one. So, now what? You and Darryl break up? And then Jimmy Jr. comes running? And Rosa and my math scores, according to Darryl's theory, which is probably right, since he's the smartest boy I've ever dated. Fake dated. Right, right. Fake dated. So, the breakup, is it gonna be classy or nasty? Definitely nasty. Want to know how many holds will be barred? Three? None. Wow, that is... so few. You ready to do this? Maybe we should practice more. What if we break up tomorrow or next month? Nah, we got this. Showtime. For you, my sweets. A gardenia? My favorite flower? Aah, that's it! I can't take it anymore! What do you mean? You're just too kind and generous. It's making me sick. Oh, yeah? Well, you're too damn interesting, and it's driving me nuts. What's going on here? Cupid's Couple is having a quarrel and a half. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Your charisma is overwhelming me! Why can't you be un-charming for one damn second? I can't change how incredible I am. Just like you can't change how phenomenal you are. Then maybe we shouldn't date each other anymore. (crowd gasping) You mean break up, effective immediately? And date other people at this and/or other schools? It's our only choice! I wish I knew how to tame you, you wild stallion! Have a great life. You too, soulful wonder lady. Hey, Rosa, sorry you had to see that. Man, that was rough. Are you okay, Darryl? I'll be all right. (voice breaking): Thanks for asking. You're welcome. That was so intense. I thought they were going to last forever and ever. But instead they just imploded right before our eyes. So, Tina's single again? Why do you want to know? I-I don't care. Jimmy Jr. likes Tina! No, I don't. Look at Rosa and Darryl. That happened fast. The kid's a genius. Yeah, they're really hitting it off, those two. Good for them. Hey, Tina. Hello, Jimmy Jr. A bunch of us are going bowling tonight, and since you and Darryl aren't a couple anymore, I was wondering if you want to come. Bowling? Did someone say nachos? Um, I was kind of talking to Tina. This is just for older kids. Tina is insisting that we go with her and that she pay for us, because we know so much about bowling. Some might say too much. Wait, I don't get it. How could you know About... too much about bowling? We know too much about... Bowling. No. It's something else. Bowling. Uh-huh. So, I'm gonna take off. Uh, well see you tonight. Jimmy Jr.: Yeah. We know too much about the Cupid's Couple thing. Oh! Okay. Yeah, you can come. Linda: Look what's back. No, no, no. Yes, yes, yes. Since the kids are out, and the bubble bath was a little too bubbly for some, we're gonna finish strong with... No. Striptease. Oh. Yeah. Ooh! Yeah. That could be fun. I'd like that. I'd like that, too. See you strut your stuff. Wait, me? Yeah. Magic Mike me, baby. (chuckles) Lin, you don't want that. Oh, but I do. Really? Okay. Then I'll do it. Yeah! Do it. But if I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna really do it, Lin. I'm gonna go all in. Bobby! If Bob Belcher strips, he's gonna strip serious. Like what? Like how? Like crazy. Like you've never seen, like you wa... you won't even want it. Yeah! After 20 seconds of my striptease, you're gonna... you'll want to leave. (whoops) I'm gonna go shave my chest and pick out some music. Let's do it! Oh, maybe brush your teeth, too. Oh, right. Maybe floss. Okay. Yes. Louise: On your marks, get set, go. Yeah! Man: Lane five, don't do that. What, don't bowl? Hm, feels like there's a strike in here. Huh. Those cheeks aren't leaving me weak like they usually do. (groans) Hell, yeah! Boom shaka-laka! That's my boy! Get over here! Come on. Get over here. Ow. Ow, ow, ow! Zeke, ow. (laughter) Oh, Darryl. (growling) Come on! Come on! Ow, Zeke, ow! That's too rough. Come on! Rosa, don't move. There's a huge beetle on your back. Oh, no. Aah! (laughter) I love it when you do that. That's-that's my favorite joke thing that we do. That's it! Oh, I can't take it anymore! Are you okay, Tina? Yeah, your face does not look exactly normal for a human. No, I'm not okay! Yeah, 'cause seriously, your expression is like... (growls) None of this is okay, okay? I'm tired of lying. You need to know the truth. Tina, what are you doing? Oh, boy. Everyone... Darryl and I only pretended to be a couple, so he could trick Rosa into dating him. And he would tutor me in math, but we didn't get around to much of that. We lied to you, and you all fell for it. That's weird. I'm outta here. Darryl, is this true? Uh... Kind of? Well, then I kind of never want to see you again. Rosa, come back! Tina, what the hell are you doing? Um, I-I guess... I guess... You guess what? I guess I fell for you. (crowd gasping) What?! But we were pretending! Well, I wasn't. (groans) What a tangle-assed web we weave. (pins crashing) You fell for me? How? Why? Because you did nice things and said nice things, and we had our special side hug thing. You told me to do those things. Well, can't you just be that guy? No, that guy doesn't even exist. But you fell for the Tina I was when we were together. No, I didn't. Let's assume you did and work backwards from there. No, Tina, we don't even like the same stuff. Sure we do. Do you like math? No. And video games? No... And comic books? No. And going to the science museum? No... You know who likes all those things? Who? Rosa! Rosa likes all that stuff! Oh, God, you and Rosa should be together. Yes, we should. I broke up a perfectly good relationship. Yes, you did. I need to get you two back together. Yes, you do. Oh, boy. I hope I'm as good at getting you guys back together as I was at breaking you up. Go, go, go, go, go! Linda: You're taking forever in there. You better not be using all my baby oil. Bob: Okay, I'm coming out. I started to shave, but I stopped. So don't look at my back. Okay. Should I hit play, or...? Not yet. (groans): Oh, G... Oh, my God. That's really tight. Okay now. Now, go. (whoops) (music playing) Party time. Well, well, (panting) well. Ha ha! Did someone... Just give me a second. You all right? All right, let me just come right back. Okay. All right, go, go... Just stop the music for a second. I'll be right back. All right. I'm gonna look away. All right put it on. I'm ready, I'm ready. Here we go and play. Hey, there, lady. Did someone order take out, or should I say take off? Oh, yeah. How do you like that? Mm. (whoops) Oh, you like it? Yeah! Well, it's just getting started. Let's get it down and dirty. Take it off, baby! (whoops) Yeah! (whooping) Ha, ha! How's this working for you? 'Cause this is my one move. Give it to mama. Let's orbit the Earth. Let's orbit the Earth. I like it. It's circular. Round. I'm getting dizzy. Yeah, yeah. No, this is what I practiced. Oh. Oh, yeah. Let's go the other way. Going counter-clockwise. Man (outside): You're terrible! Did you just hear something? Nah, nah, keep going. I think it's in the song. Keep going. Dennis: Put on some clothes, big boy! Oh, my God. The curtain's open. Oh, God. What happened to your back? Nobody wants to see that. (laughing) Hey! I do! Sorry. I was doing a striptease for my wife for Valentine's Day, all right? Valentine's Day was days ago. Give it up. All right, fine. I'm closing the curtains. Oh, no. Crap. They're not closing. I'm sorry, Bobby. This Valentine's Days thing was a bad idea. We just stink at it. We stink. No, no, Lin, you know what? I said I was gonna do it, so I'm gonna do it. All right? I'm gonna do it. Yeah? Take a seat, Lin. I'm going back on the table. Do it! (laughs) (whooping) Ow! (music resumes) Orbit the Earth. Orbit the Earth. Oh, Bobby, spin me right round. It's all coming off, baby! Ass! Rosa? Rosa? There you are. It's okay you didn't say anything back when I called your name all those times. Look, Darryl lied about liking me, but he didn't lie about liking you. You gotta give him another chance. Why should I? Because Darryl and I were a great fake couple, but you and Darryl can be a great real couple. And why would we be a great real couple? 'Cause you're looking at me and you're still blasting lizard guys like crazy. They're not lizards. They're snakes. And technically, they're actually demons from the black castle. Demons from the black castle. Ugh! I came here to get away from you. An arcade might not be the best place to get away from Darryl. Rosa, will you press two-players with Darryl for one game and see how it goes? No. No way. He tricked me into liking him. No. I realize now the only people that got tricked were me and Darryl. You and Darryl? I tricked myself into falling for a version of Darryl that I created. Then Darryl tricked himself into being confident enough to talk to you. Ugh! Leave me alone, all right? Forget it, Tina; Rosa's back to being out of my league. Damn it, there are no leagues! Voice (over P.A.): League bowling will now begin on lanes nine through 12. Okay, except bowling leagues. But there shouldn't be people leagues. But there are, Tina; That's just how it is. You're the one who thought you were out of Rosa's league. Not Rosa. Why, because you peed on the slide in second grade? You're the only one still holding onto that. No, I totally remember. Okay, so you and Jocelyn, and I remember, too. The point is, Darryl, if you liked Rosa, then you should have just gone and talked to her. Even if she remembered the pee thing. Could you just, um, stop bringing that up? Right. The pee thing? Yes. (sighs) Rosa, I'm sorry. I should have just told you I liked you. Yes, you should have. So will you guys press two player already? Are you crazy? I'm on the black castle level! She's on the black castle level! Oh. We said the same thing at the same time. You know there's a hidden power-up on that level. Nuh-uh. Really? Want me to show you? Yes. Girls: Aw. They're like Mario and Luigi. They're so in love. Dang it, Tina's inspired me. Jocelyn? What? Could you scooch out of the way? I want to ask out that shoe rental woman. She's like 35, Zeke. And she's wearing a wedding ring. So? No leagues. I'm the only one holding me back, because I think I'm too bow-legged. But I'm not. Just the right amount. So let me waddle over here and just ask her out right now. Hey, baby! Well, mission accomplished. Absolutely. Except that Jimmy Jr. ran out on you. And you're probably gonna fail that math test. No. I may have failed Jimmy Jr., but I'm not going to fail the math test. I'm gonna ace it. Or at least get a B. In which case I'll "bace" it. Aw, nuts. I "daced" it. Remedial at love, remedial at math. Jimmy Jr., I didn't know you were bad at math. Yeah, real bad. You want to be bad at math together? Yeah, okay. Sure. Yes.  Girl...  I wish you were in all my classes  Classes  And when we kiss  We hit our glasses  Glasses  Now let's slow dance  Like molasses  Molasses  Like mo-oh-oh-la-a-a-a-a-a-asses.  Thank you, good night!
Louise: Uh, lower. L-lower. L-little lower. Just a tiny bit more. Uh... Yeah, in the trash. Now, stomp it down with your foot. Louise, I'm beginning to think you might not care about Jimmy Jr. winning this election. You're so wrong, Tina. I definitely don't care. Well, he's going to win. Henry Haber is the only other candidate, and his campaign slogan is "chess we can." Which game is chess again? The one with the checkers? Hi, Jimmy Jr., Zeke. Why is my campaign poster in the trash? Because it won't fit in the toilet. Doesn't matter... the math club did a poll, and I'm up by 95 points. We're talking landslide, baby. (Laughing): Here come the mud! (Laughing): Okay, don't landslide me, Zeke. I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you. Come on, come on. Ow. Ow. Why do you even want to be president, Jimmy Jr.? To pick songs at dances. I hate it when it goes fast song, slow song, medium song. I want ten fasts, then ten slows. Guys, shh, Haber-danger. Oh, hey, Habes... you about ready to say Uncle? The election is still four days away. Ever hear of the tortoise and the hare? Uh, no. What're you sayin' about Jimmy Jr.'s hair? It's nice! I mean, "hare", like, rabbit. Well, your hair looks like a weasel. What? That's... (Laughing) Fast song, fast song, fast song... Go, go... fast song, fast song, fast song... Go, go. fast song, fast... All right, Jimmy Jr. for president. They got a lotta ladles. Ooh, I liked saying that. Lotta ladles, lotta ladles. Lotta ladles, lotta ladles. Bob: Lin. Lotta ladles, lotta ladles, Lin. Lotta ladles. Lin, look at this. What? A kitchen knife for $300. $300?! You think if I pick it up, a giant rock will come rolling at us? Wha...? I'm talking about lndiana Jo... Who the hell's lndiana Joe? Whoa. Bob? (Singing nonsense) Hi, Louise! (Screams) Crap! Millie! What are you sneaking up on me for? I have a new secret handshake for us. I bend your finger really far back. Ow! And you bend my finger really far back. And then into a hug-shake! (Groans) Stop hug-shaking me. Tina, get her off of me! Okay, um, can you let her go? (Sighs) So what's new, Millie? Oh, I'm just doing the fourth grade thing. You know, taking some classes, squeezing in some recess. All that running around doesn't leave enough time for my best friend over here, though. We're not best friends, Millie. Right, I'm your Nemesis... we love each other, but we've got some history. You're not my Nemesis. We are, we're nemesises... ses. We're rivals who are also totally obsessed with each other... "fremesises." Oh, like Batman and Catwoman. And like socks and sandals. Millie, this is all in your head. We are nothing. Nothing! So we're on for lunch? No, we're not on for anything. I want a Millie-free zone around me, at least three lunch tables wide. Okay, three inches wide. Not three inches! Three tables!  Little bunny Lou-Lou  Hopping through the forest...  I don't even know why we're talking, because I am not getting a $300 knife. No, of course. The Fukinawa is really only for professional chefs... Well, I'm a professional chef, actually. Eh. Of course. I am. Absolutely you are. It doesn't mean I buy $300 knives. That are "hand-forged by a master blacksmith in his mountaintop workshop." Oh, boy, that's really good. Why is that good? Are we doing this? Okay, I'm recommending a 24-hour cooling-off period. I think we're doing this. Here, hold on. Spread it around. Chess we can. Mm-hmm, thanks. Another Jimmy Jr. Voter, huh? I get it, he's everybody's friend. Yeah, I'm not really political. I'd rather be everybody's president. You're their friend, but you're their boss. Oh? You-you have power over 'em, to help them. Power... To help. Power. Y-you're focusing on the power. Power. I should... I'm gonna pass these out... Power. Over here. No. I'm running for president, Louise. (Laughs) Ooh, I love your poster font, Millie. They use it for horror movies. Uh, Mr. frond? A fourth grader can't be president, right? Don't be a grade-ist, Louise. It's a young person's job. There's a lot of burnout. Button? (Screams) Get that thing away from me. And good luck convincing anybody to vote for you. Thanks for your support! (Laughs) Louise: Good-bye, Millie. With all the ballots counted, Wagstaff's new president is Millie Frock. Ugh, I don't believe it! Louise, can you come up here, please? I want to make an announcement. No, thank you. Wrestling team, bring her to me. Ugh, let me go! Home ec class, sew her to my side. (Louise gasps) Metal shop, make a metal sculpture of us. Choir, sing my new school anthem. (Choir repeats):  Millie and Louise  Marching band, play the "Millie and Louise overture." Dance club, dance. Cheerleaders, cheer! No, no, no. Millie! Tina, wake up, wake up. Oh, what a coincidence. You watch me when I sleep, too? No, I want to join the Jimmy Jr. campaign. (Yawning): Welcome aboard. I'll show you how to use the puffy paints tomorrow. No, I know how to use them. I want to manage his campaign. But, um, that's what I do. Shh, shush, just go back to sleep. When you wake up, you'll be assistant campaign manager. But I'm the... Shh! Sleepy, sleepy. Millie is already up to one percent support. Our lead was this, now it's this. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, what do you mean "our" lead? Did Tina die and make you campaign manager? No, I didn't die, I just fell asleep. Well, I'm really popular. I'm not worried about Millie. You should be. Last month we had to name the class chinchilla, and Millie had the worst idea of all. How about princess little piddles? I said what everyone was thinking. How about princess Fluffy vomit? Right, Millie? Is that what you're going for? You're gonna ruin this chinchilla's life. Then we all voted. And somehow "princess little piddles" was the name the class picked! Millie gets her way. I kind of want her to name me now. On to campaign strategy... we've got to up our game. I can make another poster... maybe I dot the "I" in "Jimmy" with a check mark? It's a little wild, but it just might work. (Chuckles) That's a good... That's actually a really good... Yeah. No, no posters... print is dead. We've got TVs in the classroom. We need a commercial. The only thing standing between us and a Millie-ocracy is Jimmy Jr.'s dumb pretty face. Ow. That's the new knife, huh? Yeah, it's so responsive. It's, like, connected to my brain. I think "chop", and it chops. Yeah, I got a hammer like that. Us guys and our tools. Chop. (Falsetto): Right away, Bob. Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop. I think we got enough onions, Bob. Do I tell you or that car payment you're holding? You can tell us both. (Sighs) It's a McLecklin, my hammer. You know that brand, Bob? McLecklin? I don't know hammer brands, Teddy. They're the best... they're like the Meryl Streep of hammers. Ah, look at that slice. Uh, I'm not crying because of the onions, I'm crying because it's beautiful. And it's so thin, I could actually use it as a tissue. Ow, ow, that's a bad idea. I made a video of my hammer pounding nails. I put a Natalie merchant song under it. Dedicated it to my dad. Yeah, but your hammer and my knife... (chuckling): It's not really the same thing. Want to read some of the comments, Bobby? Uh, I don't... no. This guy... he says, "nailed it!" (Laughs) Oh, the lnternet. Before we begin, we have a message from one of the candidates for student body president. (Students groan) Settle down, it's not Henry Haber.  I'm Jimmy Jr. Pesto  You know I am the best-o  I'm cooler than the rest-o  He wrote the hot-guy manifesto?  We wish we were Jimmy Jr. Pesto  Key change!  I'm Jimmy Jr. Pesto  You know me from the vest-o  And I'm on a quest-o  To be the president-o?  You wish you were Jimmy Jr. Pesto.    Let's do this! (Screams) Oh, barf. I want to slap that kid. I know, right? Oh... I'm Tammy with Wagstaff school news. Our top story... did a super lame ad take Jimmy Jr. From front runner to dumb bummer? (Buzzing) We got reactions. I felt like I was covered in something gross, and I wanted to burn my eyeballs. Basically. I wouldn't braid his hair with your hands. What a (Bleep). Sorry. We pooped the bed! This station is biased. I'm sure most people liked it. This just in... Millie's gained 30 points on Jimmy Jr. Oh, man. Okay, a little setback. Manageable. Now we know what not to do, so we go hard the other way. Hang on, kids, we're going negative. Gene: it's 3:00 p.m. at Wagstaff, (Phone rings) And a telephone is ringing. The bake sale is out of snicker-doodles. Maybe that doesn't sound like a big deal, but it is because some people really like them. Who do you want answering the call? A fourth grader with multiple tardies and multiple screws loose? Millie... too dangerous for the bake sale, too dangerous for Wagstaff. Vote for Jimmy Jr. maybe. That was mean. Now I know who I'm voting for, for sure. Our big brother is mean? Is that what we're gonna turn into? I won't let you. I'm turning! Leave before I hurt you! Oh, boy. Tammy: I'm here in the studio with Millie, the victim of a vicious Jimmy Jr. attack ad. Girl, how you holding up? (Sighs) I'm okay. I'm strong. I-I have to be strong. For Wagstaff. You know what, negativity always backfires. Jocelyn does it all the time, and it's lame, and she's lame. Not to be negative. This is a great interview. You know, you're really good at this. I know, I know I am. I want to endorse you... can I do that? Mr. grant is shaking his head "no," but I'm doing it. And I'm getting a new poll. Oh, my God, you're winning! Louise, what's going on? I'm supposed to be ahead. It's under control. Tammy just handed us the answer. Negativity backfires. Which means it also, uh, "front fires." Change of strategy. Posters, on it. Everybody like bubble letters? I don't know, they're pretty flashy. No, we go hard negative against Jimmy Jr. Huh? What? Try to keep up, pretty boy. Wait, what? Millie gets blamed. See, it's foolproof. I'm figuring this crap out, people. I'm feeling pretty confident now! (Groans nervously) Lin, I just cut a grain of rice into six pieces. Come look. No! Teddy, look at what my Fukinawa and I did. Can't, Bob. I brought my McLecklin in so I can finish off this birdhouse. Wait, what? You can't do that here. We're two guys with tools we love, making it happen. Teddy, stop... you don't compare a stupid hammer to a Fukinawa knife. Stupid hammer? And your birdhouse. Oh, here we go. Oh, I understand. I understand that your weeny grapefruit knife isn't half the tool my McLecklin is. Not half! Take that back, Teddy. I'm not going to. You know what, we'll settle it. Okay, you're on. How do we do that? I don't know, it's probably impossible. Ugh, you men competing over your little toys. The only way I'm gonna care about this is if I get involved. Oh, I got it! Knife-hammer olympics I got to plan the opening ceremonies. Gene: Wagstaff has questions for Jimmy Jr. Why does he dance all the time? What's he hiding? Does he have to go? Why doesn't he stop dancing and just go? Tell Jimmy Jr. to go to the bathroom already. By the way, here's his fifth grade picture. It's terrible! Paid for by students of Wagstaff of America for change. I'm down by 70 points? No one blamed Millie. Why won't people just think what we want them to think?! You turned Jimmy Jr. From hero to zero! It's not supposed to go that way! You took something beautiful, and tore it to pieces. I don't even want to hang out with him anymore! No, Zeke! No! No! I'm sorry, Jay-ju! She wrecked you! (Crying): Oh, God. Okay, we double down! We go after Jimmy Jr. harder. Nothing's off limits... the lisp, the weird brothers, dating Tina. I quit, Louise. Right, right. Take a break. Okay. Break's over. Back to work! Millie said if I dropped out, she'd let me pick songs at dances. It's all I wanted anyway. After all I've done! Good-bye, Louise! Ha-ha! (Gasps) Ready to wear my button, Louise? Never! Uh, Henry, hi, uh, hey! Meet your new campaign manager. First off, let's ditch those glasses. Uh, no, thanks. I've seen what your help can do. But we've got to stop Millie from becoming president, Henry! Then maybe you should run yourself. You can manage your own campaign. The combination of you and you should be unstoppable. Pretty sure you're being sarcastic, but you know what? That's a great idea! Louise for president, everybody! Two more ears! Two more ears! I don't know Louis. Do you really think You can beat Millie? Yes. I'm way behind, but I've got core grassroots support from friends and family. And are you wearing a freaking Millie button?! Well, you've been the one acting crazy lately, not Millie! Because she's making me act crazy! That's how good she is! At least gene is loyal. And it has nothing to do with Millie being out of buttons! Nothing! Millie: Oh, Louise. You're so obsessed with me. I mean, I run for president, you run for president. Millie, I know you only want to be president so you can control people. Control me! This election is about Wagstaff. Let's take the U and the I out of it. Oh, look, now it spells "lose". That was in Louise's name all along and we never saw it! This is fun. Do "Tina". Just wait for the debate, Millie. I'm gonna pin you to the mat. Oh, yeah? Yeah! (Whispering): And speaking of pins, Millie, get any more in or not yet? Here is how it works. The knife and the hammer will perform a series of parallel tasks designed to determine the biggest tool. Better tool. Bob, you will slice ten tomatoes while Teddy pounds ten nails into a board. Go! Going pretty fast over here, Teddy. Listen to that tone, Bob! That's McLecklin, baby! Fukinawa's in charge! Don't hit your thumb! Don't cut off your pinky! Done! Done! Tie! Round two. Switch stations. Bob, pry up Teddy's nails. Teddy, nail Bob's tomatoes back together and go! Nail tomatoes? All right, I took a sh*t. It took you a day to think of this? Frond: The next question is to Louise. What makes you best qualified to be president? It's pretty simple. I'm not Millie. People, Millie doesn't even want to be president. She just wants to be in my business. Live in my head and attach herself like a conjoined twin. Growing out of my side one leg, one arm, and a head on my head. Good answer. Thank you. Uh, okay. Millie, you have the floor. You've heard my platform. I would like to add that I would increase the budget for student counseling so that Louise can get the help she clearly needs. The help that I need?! That's like... I'm also for longer recesses, a besties system, and bigger desserts! Yeah! Wait. Back up. "A besties system"? I'm moderating, Louise! "A besties system"? "Besties"... it stands for "buddying-up everyone with someone to improve the experience of school." That's elegant. She's really good at that stuff. School's hard. No one should have to go through it alone. With an assigned bestie, you'll have someone to do homework with, someone to sit with at lunch. Someone who knows all your thoughts, who can finish your sentences! (Laughs) Here we go! What do you want to bet Millie assigns herself as my bestie, huh? Besties will be assigned alphabetically by first name. Hey, Zane! You and me, bro! Huh. Well, who does that put together? Oh, Louise and Millie. What a surprise! See, people? Millie's obsessed! It's me now. But tomorrow it might be you! Or you! Probably not you, boy sucking on watch. Oh, Louise, you need a bestie so bad! Aw, someone give Louise a bestie! She's so sad. And that concludes our debate. I think we know who won. No questions for me? Seriously? Oh, didn't see you up there, Henry. After-debate hug-shake! (Groaning) (Shushing) You'll like being my bestie. (Whispering): You'll have no choice! So, after five rounds, we're dead even. And we accidentally nailed the board to the counter. That was bad. Who knew nails were so long? Hmm. Sorry. But it gives me an idea for the next event. Who can make a hole in the counter first? Go! Oh, we're really gonna regret this! I'll fix it later... With my hammer! No, you won't! You'll never fix anything with that! Yes, I will! I'll come back later. Linda: Bye, Mort! Hey, kid! Yeah, kid! You, yeah! Hey, come on, vote for me! Come on, help a candidate out. Oh, gross, she's still running. Don't make eye contact, just keep walking. I saw you, Jocelyn! Keep walking, keep walking. I'm a human being! Look at me! I'll vote for you, Louise. Thanks, Andy. I'm Ollie! Forget it! Which one am I? (Groans) I'm gonna lose. Oh! "Follow the braid, check the files, what you find will make you smile." Maybe someone who wears braids. Snoop dogg? Follow Snoop Dogg. I already do. Mostly retweets and recipes. (Louise gasps) Braids! Abby! But how does she figure into this? Frond (Over intercom): Attention... all students to the gymnasium. Voting for Mill... president will begin in 15 minutes. We've got to sneak into frond's office, and see what he's got on Abby. Okay, good luck. I have to go vote for Millie, bye. No, Tina! I need your help. I need an extra pair of hands. You messed up the campaign. You wouldn't listen to me. Yes, but party loyalty? We're both registered belchers. (Sighs) I am a belcher. Yay, us! The farty party! Quick, we'll dig through his files until we find something! And we'll dig through his zen garden until we find enlightenment. Or a clam. Look at the size of this file. That's Abby's? No, it's yours. Here's Abby's. Oh, my God! This changes everything! We've got to get down there before the vote. What are you doing in my office? What are you doing in your office? I came up to get a little rubber thing for my finger to count votes with so... I don't have to explain myself! It's my office! Oh, we were just leaving. Get comfortable. You're not going anywhere. Who-who touched my zen garden?! It's gonna take me all afternoon to re-zen that thing. Please let us go, Mr. Frond! No. Frankly, Louise, your behavior lately has been extra erratic. You need some counseling. Gosh, Mr. Frond, you're right. I think I might be on the verge of a breakthrough. Oh, good. Breakthrough! (All yelling) Damn you for making me run! We got to wrap this up, Lin. I mean, it's not great for business. We totally screwed up the counter. And nothing's settled. If anything, we've raised more questions. I'm gonna say we're still even. And there's only one thing left. Knife against hammer! Hammer against knife! Metal against metal! No way. We're-we're done. A tie is good. Yeah, Bob loves his knife. I'd hate to destroy it. My knife was made with hammers, Teddy. Hammering would actually make it stronger, so... Whatever you want to tell yourself. I get to go first! Five second rounds. Go! Fukinawa, go! Chop! Chop! Chop! Chop! Chop! Ding! Hammer time! Mcleckli die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Aah! It's not getting stronger! Fukinawa! Teddy, you can stop! It's dead. We got a winner! Let me see that thing. God, I really want a McLecklin. Ah, good, we're not too late. Everyone, before you vote, I have something to say to Millie! And I want you all to hear it! Just give up, Louise! I have. I just want to say to Millie early congratulations, and you know what? I think being a bestie will be fun. Wha-what have you done with Louise? Oh, by the way, I won't be your bestie. I'll be Abby's. Sorry? Oh, you didn't know? Abby's real name is Mabel. "Mabel" comes between "Louise" and "Millie." Your alphabetical rule. Wait a minute... Abby is Mabel? Abby's actually a nickname for Mabel, but no one knows that, so I guess... I'm not talking to you, Abby! Oh, okay. Mabel, you still into braiding? Want to take a whack at this mop? Do you like French braids or a fishtail? Hey, you're my bestie, you decide! Yeah, well, whatever, we still might end up being besties. Except we won't. I'll be Abby's. I mean Mabel's. Whatever. Whatever. But hey, we can talk later. Let's vote. Yeah, let's vote. But let's talk now for a minute. Because we will be besties, Louise! Yeah. But no. Look, it's your rule. Well, when I'm president, I'll change the stupid rule, okay? The new rule will make us besties! And if it doesn't, I'll change it again! And I'll change it again! Because you will be my bestie! And if I have to get rid of Abby or Mabel or whoever, I will! Careful, that's a five-strand braid. Took me all morning! Millie! And... scene! Um... If elected, I'll-I'll start an improv club. Let's do one more. Okay. Someone throw out a-an, uh, occupation... And an animal? I heard fireman? And pig? Did somebody say pig? I think Millie just lost. Impossible... the only losers in improv are the audience. Wait, do we still like her? We don't, right? She's gross, right? Millie is disqualified for attacking Abby. Louise, you were second in the poll. You're going to be president! Whew, head rush! I'm already a little drunk with power! Louise is disqualified for breaking into my office. Oh. So we're out of candidates. No president this year. Uh... (Clears his throat) Oh, wait, Henry Haber. Congratulations, Henry Haber. Hi. Uh, today my vote really counted. In my country, before the coup, I was president. You are so freaking lucky, Henry Haber! (Laughs) Luck. Is that what you want to call it? Uh, yeah. I guess I was just lucky when I figured out that to get rid of Jimmy Jr., I had to lure Millie into the race. And I guess I was just lucky when I knew that she would pull you in on the Jimmy Jr. side, and that you would tank his campaign. How could you know that? A chinchilla named princess little piddles told me. What? My younger brother Hogarth saw the whole thing. That name didn't have a chance till you went overboard dumping on it because it was Millie's idea. And all the kids felt bad for her. Millie makes you completely irrational. I'm not irrational. She just drives me totally insane! Then I had to take care of Millie. So I got you to run. Then I helped you take her down in a way that also took you down. We were pawns? I believe you mean "prawns". You can't be that smart. Chess I can. Wow. Brains and brawn... Is what I would say if you had the brawn part. How can you play with people's lives like that? Who the hell do you think you are, Henry Haber? You're gonna be an amazing president. I was an amazing president. What happened? Mmm... coup.  doctors have come  From distant cities  Just to see me  Stand over my bed  Is believing  What they're seeing  They say I must be one of the wonders  Of God's own creation  And as far as they can see they can offer  No explanation. 
Hey, this stool is making a new sound when I spin on it. It's somewhere right between seal the animal and Seal the amazing singer. (squeaking, singing) I'd buy that stool's album. Hey, hey. No having fun. You kids are grounded. Here's something fun. I need someone to run the old grease out to the Dumpster. Don't talk about Mom that way. Mom, are you still mad? You grounded us four hours ago. We've grown so much since then. Yes. I'm still mad. And I'm gonna be mad about it forever. But it's the weekend. Everybody's supposed to go to Bernie's! Come on, Lin. I-I know you... No! Can I just... L-Lin. Not talking about it. Ever. Oh. Here comes Aunt Gayle. And I know this sounds crazy, but she looks like she's crying. Oh, God. She can't just stop by, can she? Why don't we have a panic room? Well, my life is ruined. (crying) Oh, God. What's wrong? Oh, Linda, you remember that guy I met on Cat Chat? Stacy? Yeah... Wait, men can be named Stacy? I love America! Well, we were supposed to go see Yarnival... it's like Cirque du Soleil but with cats... and then he canceled. So I guess I'll take Bob. Oh. Uh, no. No, no, no. No. J... No. I'll go with you, Aunt Gayle. We've been meaning to hang out for ages but couldn't make our calendars work, remember? No, take me! I yearn for yarn. Please, Gayle! I need to breathe outside air! I need to touch the wind! Wow, you guys really want to hang out with me. Ah, they only want to go 'cause they're grounded. Why are they grounded? Well... No reason! I just felt like it. They're not allowed to go. Okay, fine. I'll go by myself. That's okay. I can use the empty seat next to me to slump into when I die alone! (crying) All right, fine. One of them can go. I don't care which one. They're all equally terrible. Eeny, meeny... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold up there. You have to let us compete for it. To the d*ath. No. No d*ath, Louise. Or we could, I don't know, maybe go by, uh, who has the biggest ding dong. Gene. Mmm? No. I'll tell you what you're gonna do. You're gonna do something you hate. Let me see. What do you hate? Nachos? Homework. That's what you're gonna do. You're gonna do math. Or we could write essays. (gasps) (grunts) How dare you. Never! What a great idea, Tina. I love it. Since I'm the one with the tickets, I want the essays to be about me! I want action, adventure, love, drama. And Scott Bakula. Oh, God. All right, you heard the lady. Your time starts... now! Linda: And time. Pencils down. Okay, who's up? Who's gonna read? I'll go first because I have the biggest ding dong! Gene. Mmm. My story is called "The Ballad of Gayle and Jo Gene." And I hope you brought your hankies and some toilet paper, 'cause there's not gonna be a dry eye or butt in the house. The place: Nashville, Tennessee. It was a hot, sweaty night, and the patrons at the Fiddle of the Road Saloon couldn't wait to hear their favorite act, Lindette and Jo Gene. They had the glitz and glam to make you say, "Hot damn!"  La, la, la, la, la, la, la  Lana loves a llama, but the llama loves pajamas. Y'all sound great, Lindette. I better. Lou Belchera is here, the big fancy Hollywood singing agent. So don't screw it up for me. (coughing) (cheering and applause) A-one, a-two, a-one, two, three, four.  Oh, the sheriff had a piggy  And he was mighty mad  He saw me a-coming and my wiener he did grab  (cheering)  Now I can't quit cryin' and life just ain't no fun  'Cause a fat dog ate my hot dog  And I got nothin' but the bun.  Yeehaw!  (cheering and applause) Wow. Wowee, wow, wow, wow. (clapping) Hi, kids. I'm Lou Belchera, Hollywood singing agent, and I'm gonna cut to the chase. I like what you did out there. I liked it a lot. And I'd like you to be my client and compete in the Big Ole Opry sing-off next Friday. What do you say? We say yes! No, not you, fumble weed. The tall one with the big yams. I'm sorry, but we're a duo. No! I'm going solo! Wait, what? No. Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes!  Yes...  But what about me?! What about you? You heard her. I'm a star. (chuckles) No, not yet, you aren't, lady. But if you win the big sing-off tomorrow night, I'll take you to Hollywood and give you a mansion and introduce you to, uh, I don't know, Mr. Scott Bakula? Yay! Get out of here, Jo Gene. I'm like a rhinestone rainbow and you're like a trunk full of wet boots. Fine! But I'm taking the rest of the cold cuts! And my sequin tube top! And my dreams! And the pepperoncinis! Take whatever you want, you little pig. And the crudités. Don't you touch that crudités! It's mine! (indistinct chatter) sh*t of hot fudge with a root beer back. Leave the bottle. (hiccups) Tough night, huh? My singin' partner up and left me. Oh, man. (hiccups) My singin' partner up and left me 15 years ago. But look at me now. I'm doing great! Here it comes. (retching) Ah! Oh, God. Gayle! Come clean up this throw-up. Gayle:  There's lipstick on his pickup  There's mascara on the wheels  I looked inside the glove box  And I found a red high heel.  Well, pinch my loaf. That girl can sing. Those pipes you got sound like they came straight from heaven. Ugh, the bathroom pipes? Sorry they're clogged. People keep putting tampons down 'em. Even the sinks. No, no. I meant your pipes. Your singing ones. My name's Jo Gene, and I'm looking for a new singing partner. (sighs) I'm not really a singer. I'm just a beautiful waitress who cleans up throw-ups in a bar. Not anymore you're not. Let's get you to the all-night Rhinestone Warehouse quick. Linda: The preposterous ostrich's legs were monstrous. Sally Struthers' other brother's her mother. Well, howdy, former pardner. Wha? What are you doing here, Jo Gene? I came here to win with my new partner! We've got this in the bag. But not this bag I'm holding, because that has my sandwich in it! Get out of here! Ah! Not my eyes! I need them for eye exams! (quietly): Psst. Hey. Stage girl. Yes? I need you to put a rattlesnake into someone's guitar for me. Yes, ma'am.  I'll...  Trade you these tears for a couple of beers  And this snot for a sh*t of whiskey...  Oh, she's good. Yeah. She's real good.  ...too frisky.  (cheering and applause) Let's hear it for Lindette! Now a brand-new duo. He used to be Lindette's partner, and she used to be a waitress who cleaned up throw-ups. Let's give a big Nashville welcome to Gayle and Jo Gene! (cheering and applause) We call this one "I Won't Go Solo on You."  Well, I got to use the restroom  But there ain't a stall for two  So squeeze on in and don't breathe in  'Cause I won't go solo on you  (rattles) Um, I think there's a snake in my guitar. Use it.  Well, I'd like to eat spaghetti  But you want vindaloo  So I'll leave in a hurry and order some curry  'Cause I won't go solo on you  Oh, you and me  You and me  Both:  We're together through and through  (rattle)  So if you move to China  (rattle)  I'll be right behind ya  'Cause I won't go solo on you.  (cheering and applause) BOTH: Yeehaw! (snake rattles) (rattles) And the winner is... Gayle and Jo Gene! And that wacky snake! What? That's my snake! I should win! Oh, my face! Gene: So Lou Belchera signed them and took them to Hollywood, where they saw the Hollywood Sign and met Scott Bakula! I come to the second "O" in the Hollywood sign when I'm feeling sad, but, oh, boy, am I glad I met you. And Lindette ended up married to the old drunk from the bar because she was a mean person who liked grounding people and going solo. (retching) Aw, nuts. The end. (gasps) Oh, I just loved it, Gene! Well, I hated it. Boo. You win, Gene!  I won't go solo on you  (humming) Come on! Let's go! Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait! What about my story? And more importantly, my story. Oh, right, right. My story is called "Lady Chatterteeth's Lover." The sisters Chatterteeth were the most beautiful sisters in all of Withering Wharf, especially Gayle. She was what you'd call a ten. She had an almost equally beautiful sister, Tina. She was like a nine. Nine and a half, maybe. Also there was Eugenia and Louisa, but they were less important and not that much fun in general. Though Gayle was extremely beautiful, she was also extremely shy. Gayle, could you please pass me the bread? (quietly): Sorry. I can't. I'm too shy. And the sisters were poor. Very, very poor. My petticoats are unspeakable! The sisters got by as seamstresses, sewing the butts back on to soldiers' pants when they were sh*t off in battle. Mmm... Tina longed to marry Lord Jimmy Jr., whose butt had been spared in battle, but according to the law of the land, she couldn't do so until her eldest sister Gayle was married first. So many fallen butts. Why for not can there be an end to this war? At least we have the Rich Man's Ball to look forward to. Pass. Oh, dear sister. I cannot go to the ball. I'm far too shy. But, sister, until you marry, none of us can marry, either. I want a wedding! But instead of a wedding cake, I want to get a bunch of cupcakes because it's a long time ago, so that idea is still good! I am afraid I'm far too shy. We're all going to die alone because of me. Don't be mad, though, 'kay? That was the night that Tina decided she had to find a match for Gayle. It was mere days before the Rich Man's Ball, and so Tina had to find Gayle a suitor and with haste. Tina tried every eligible bachelor she could think of, but unfortunately she could only think of one. Theodore the blacksmith. Thank you. Whoa, what do you call this thing? It's a cup. Say it again. It's amazing. A cup. You've never seen a cup before? Nope. I drink by sticking my head in the river. Oh. And what's this? What's what? Uh, this thing all around us. A house? How are you saying that? House? No, house. House. How-use. How-use. How-use. House. House. House. Oh, God. How-use. How-use. House. So quick. House. And what about... what about... what about... what about... what about... But alas, Gayle's heart remained empty. Until he showed up. My horse broke down in front of your cottage. May I use your old-fashioned ink pens and paper to alert my family and friends to my delay? Then I will send the letters with my servant, and my family will receive the letters right before I get there. It's a pretty good system. Of course, sir... Sir Bob. Belcher. Lord and heir to the Belcher Burger fortune. Oh, my God, that's Bob. (all whispering) Why, you're the lord throwing the Rich Man's Ball, are you not? And who is this? Ah! Your ankles are... great. Ah! Her name is Gayle, and she's not married. And if you like her ankles, you should see her shins. Her shins go on for inches. You better not be marrying my Bob off to Gayle, little missy. Ugh, just let me finish, okay? Well, Gayle, I hope I shall see you at mine ball. Oh! Ah! Ah. Should I, uh, pick her up? Nah, we usually just let her sleep there when that happens. Oh. Wait. No, she's on fire. Let's move her. (horse neighing) Tina: The date of the ball had arrived. Everyone from town was there. Wow. Everyone from town is here. Even Lord Ken the albino! Ken! Oh, I can't wait to see Sir Bob! Yeah. Have fun with that. I'm gonna go put a bunch of crumpets down my corset. Gonna leave this place with a month's worth of food. Hello, Gayle. What is that lovely sash about your waist? I call it a fanny pack. It's very fetching. Oh! Hi, Lady Tina. Hi. I hope you like the band Boys Fore the Present Tyme. They are very popular in the city. Come, let's dance. They're playing the Heinie Liney. Oh!     Tina, seriously? Dad, please! I'm almost done. Sir Bob and Gayle danced together all evening. They couldn't take their eyes, or butts, off of each other. Where's my sexy fiancé?! (guests gasping) Where is he?! Bob! Uh, here I am. Uh, hi... honey. I can't believe you'd have a ball without me, your loud, rude, American wife-to-be that you're marrying for money! (gasps) Come here! Give me a kiss! (making silly noises) Whoa. Uh-uh. (Linda makes silly noises, Bob mutters) Aah. Tina: Gayle was so heartbroken over Sir Bob that she fell deathly ill with pooping cough. Her sisters tried everything to bring her back to health. Leeches. Yum! Beaches. Screeches. Wake up! Stop being sick! But nothing worked. They called the vicar to come give her last rites. I'm the vicar, Scott Bakula. Well, hello! I'm feeling much better all of a sudden. Oh, good. Well, let me whisper a prayer into your mouth. (gasps) Oh! (moaning) Then they Quantum Leapt into the future to the day of their double wedding with Tina and Jimmy Jr., and they all lived happily ever after. Mmm. And Sir Bob and Linda were also married, and then they had a baby with a tail because they were cousins. The end. (gasps) That was so good! Oh, I could feel Scott Bakula's kiss whispers in my mouth! Kisspers! Ah, I've heard better. And your father and I are not cousins. That we know of. You win, Tina. Oh! Or should Gene win? Oh, gosh, this is tough. (clears throat) I think you're forgetting something. Oh, right. Okay, go ahead. I call it "Gayle of Thrones." (all gasp) Pace yourselves, guys. You're gonna want to save your gasps. Behold the tale of Queen Gayle of Catsteros. She was the most powerful woman in all of the nine Cat-life kingdoms, and mistress of the world's only cat dragons. People of Catsteros, please eat, drink and be meowy! Your Royal Highness... meow... visitors from the kingdom of Litter Boxia! Lady Gayle, we come on behalf of your sister, Lindaryen of Litter Boxia, to present you with a gift in her absence. A gift? I'm surprised. She's always been jealous of me because I have cat dragons, and I'm not a cranky old hag. Oh, well, she didn't mention that. And now, may I present, this guy! I'm Gene from the House of the Unfarting. My Queen, I am a warlock. If I disappear, just check your rear. Blee. But don't worry. I always turn up. Blee. Just never where you left me! Oh, impressive. He was over there... meow... and now he's over here. Meow. I'm befuddled. I love your cat dragons! I'll take them in my wagon. Blee. (gasps) Wha? I'm checking my rear! He's not there! And he took my cat dragons! Blee. Here I am. Oh, phew. Blee. Just kidding. No! My cat dragons are gone. I must go get them. They are my children. They've suckled at my teats! Ew. (crowd murmuring) At least let our bravest knight go with you to assist Your Grace. Meow. My Lady Gayle. Knight Louise, this is my fight. I cannot risk your life. But I can. Plus, I really dislike Lindaryen. She's a tyrant who punishes children unjustly for doing hilarious pranks. I swear my service and my steel to you. (gasps) The Burgarean Slapper! Let us be off. My cat dragons are probably very confused without me and my breast milk. People of Catsteros, remain here, remain strong. I will return with our dragons! (applause and cheering) And then I shall breast-feed all of you! Oh. Louise: And so they set off for Litter Boxia, fighting their many enemies along the way. They were held prisoner by Theus of Grimward, Thannis of Grinjammed, and Thambis of Gramjimnt. But each time, they escaped. There are the gates of Litter Boxia, My Queen. Wow, it really stinks here. Yes, Litter Boxia has not been cleaned in many moons. And outside of Litter Boxia, the most dreaded monsters in all of the Nine Cat-Life Kingdoms. (man speaking) Hark, my lady. A sound ahead. What is it? It sounds really boring. It's a White Talker! Cover your ears, or they will literally bore you into a deathlike slumber. (gasps) I tried everything to get that barbecue stain out of my underpants. The best place to park at the hardware store is probably the parking lot. Oh. Oh, I have an itch. Oh. Oh, God. Oh, it... Oh, it's so itchy. Oh, I got to itch it. Don't itch it! Oh, I can't wait any longer! Do not take your hands off your ears! My lady, no! Oh, I got to itch it. Oh, God! Oh, oh! Ugh. (yells) Oh, no. He got me. So boring. I'm... so bored. Louise...! Who goes there? It is I, Gayle, Queen of Catsteros. I seek my sister Lindaryen. She has stolen my dragons. Oh. Okay. So you're Gayle. Okay. Just go in or whatever. Hi. Everyone, listen to me sing!  La, la, la, la-la-la-la-la.  Bobdor. Gayle! Sister. Surprised to see me? Not at all! I knew you'd come, and I knew when you did I'd get rid of you once and for all! I challenge you... to a duel. (gasps) To the d*ath? Yes! But let's do that thing where we pick someone to represent us and fight in our honor, and then die in our place, right? Oh, good idea. I choose The Mort-tain! Mm, uh. Huh? Oh, okay. Um, hang on. Sorry to do this, Louise, but I need you. Aah. What-What's going on? I need you to fight for me in a duel to the d*ath. Oh! Good. Linda: Enough talk! Let the duel commence! But let's make this fight a little more interesting. Be careful not to fall into my pit of ravenous porcelain babies. (babies crying) They haven't been fed in days. (maniacal chuckle) So hungry. (grunts) (yells) Thanks for playing, big guy. Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! (babies whining) Oh, crap. Shouldn't have done that. Well, you beat me fair and square, but I'm gonna k*ll you anyway. Bobdor, throw 'em into the pit. Bobdor. Does that mean yes or no? 'Cause it's the only thing you ever say. Bobdor. Yeah, that doesn't help. I got to get a new fool. Maybe somebody thinner. I want somebody hot. What-what are you doing? Aah! Ow! Oh! My babies are eating me! Oh, bad babies! Down! Thank you, Bobdor. I'll breast-feed you first when we get back to Catsteros. All right, everybody, let's go home. (gasps) Scott Bakula?! Where did you come from? Does it really matter? Bobdor third wheel. Bye-bye. Bobdor! The end. Louise, you haven't watched Game of Thrones, right? No. Game of what? I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, Louise, that was so good. Yup. You're just all such wonderful nieces and nephews. I don't need Stacy. You've shown me that I'm talented and lovable and strong... (door opens, bells tinkle) Hey, Gayle. Still up for that date? My emergency canceled. Stacy! How'd you find me? All those messages you left me at work and at home and at my mother's telling me where you were going. Oh. Oh, yeah. Okay, let's get out of here! Bye, kids. No! No! Son of a b1tch! Mom, come on. Are we really still grounded? We were just trying to be funny. Yeah. We tried to make you laugh, but instead, you made the world laugh. Uh-huh. It did sound kind of funny. Hey, uh, Mom, uh, can we get some ice cream? Yeah. From that case right there. Yeah! Ice cream. Yummy. Good idea, girls. Freezer Frankenstein! (yelling) Oh. Uh. Whoo. Oh. Whoa. (passing wind, laughter) Lin, you fell into a pile of maxi pads, and you farted. It's pretty funny. It wasn't funny! Everyone laughed at me. Yeah. Yup. Yup. And then I had to buy all those maxi pads. Oh, it's gonna take me weeks to get through those! And then I farted again when they handed me my bags. Mom, it was perfect. Don't you see? I'm proud of you! You farted your way into our hearts, Mom. Okay. It was... it was funny. It was funny. (laughs) So, we aren't grounded anymore? Tell you what. You're grounded for tonight, and you all have to watch TV with me. All right, it's something. And we're gonna watch whatever I want, and we're gonna be a big snuggle sandwich. I'm the cheese, right in the middle, and everyone likes me! Wait, where are you going? We're not closed. We-we don't close for hours. Bye, Dad! Wai-wai-wai-wait. Don't close the d... They closed the door. I should have gone with Gayle.
Got to read, got to read, got to read, got to read, got to read, got to read, got to read, got to read. Wow, I feel the exact opposite way. Why are you saying that? Book report. I wrote the due date on my arm so I would remember, then every day since then, I've taken a shower like an idiot. When's it due? Tomorrow. Ah! What page are you on? The cover. (screaming) Call of the Wild? Is it about an insane telemarketer? Or Gene in the bathroom? I don't know yet. Hey, kids. Oh, Bob, this package came for you earlier when you were putting out that grease fire. See, that's why I hate school. We miss all the grease fires. Huh, I wasn't expecting anything. Oh. Oh, yeah. (chuckles) I-I remember ordering this. What the hell is that? I bought a remote control version of the helicopter from the movie True Lies, complete with a clutching Arnold Schwarzenegger and dangling Jamie Lee Curtis. Hmm. Oh. Hmm. Huh. What a beaut. Were you drunk shopping? No. I call it "nighttime shopping, with wine." I bid on an auction and, uh, yeah, helicopter. Mm-hmm. Fly, you b*st*rd, fly! Hold on, Jamie Lee, I gotcha. I'll save you from Tia Carrera, I think. I forget the scene. Hey, when does Mama get a turn? I want to save Jamie Lee. Lin, I just started. And I think I'm really good at this. This could be, like, my new thing. Dad, you don't want to be, like, too cool. Hello, boots. Hanging like you do every day. Give it. Geez, Lin. All right, let me just bring it in for a landing. You can't pull off that look, buddy. It's not you. Gentle, gentle, and... kiss the ground. (all groan) What the hell? How did that happen? I landed it perfectly. (squeaking) (humming) T-T-Ti... Well, it had a good run. Of one. That thing is a piece of crap. I'm getting my money back. T-Ti-Tina... Well, maybe it's okay. See? Oh, no, it's dead. Squi-Squi-Squirrel.  I'm reading  I'm reading  Bob: Oh, Tina. Tina! Tina! (grunts) Ah. Thanks, Dad. I hate getting hit on the head by boots. Uh, you're welcome, Tina. Should we throw them back up? I kind of feel bad. They've been there for so long. (grunts) Look out, Tina! I just... froze. "And following a skillful landing, "it broke into a million pieces. Please issue me a full refund of $45 plus shipping." And send. That thing was 45 bucks? Plus shipping. Which was... also 45 bucks. The hell? Ugh! What's wrong with me? I just watched everything happen! The squirrel, the boots! And I did nothing! (altering voice): Hey, let's all be quiet so Tina can read. (normally): Who said that? Face it. I'm not heroic like Arnold Schwarzenegger in True Lies! I'm not even Tom Arnold in True Lies! Or even in Roseanne! Come on, Gene. Don't worry about it. That was just part of being a dad. You'll have those instincts someday. But what if I never get those instincts? Maybe I'll just grow up to be a very handsome coward! Dad, you saved Tina! You're a heroic man of action. I can learn from you. Gene, I-I think you're blowing this out of proportion. Though I did react with a certain amount of grace under pressure. What the hell?! (computer chimes) "Sorry, I don't give refunds for crash landings"?! "Heliflopter"?! All right, new plan. His number's on the Web site. I'm calling this guy. He's doing it! He's man-of-actioning. Which I call "mactioning." Hello? Is this Sheldon Felds? This is Bob. Gene: That's it, Dad. Give it to him. No, not Bob the crash-lander. It kissed the ground, Sheldon. Kissed it. Maybe I should've just bought it from The Hobby Hole. A real store. Hobby Hole! Well, how about I just come on down and demand my money back? Yeah, your address is right on the package. So see you soon, Sheldon! Oh, and, also, your handwriting is... not very good! Nice one, Dad. Bob, don't you think maybe you should just let this go? You know how you get. You start saying "It's the principle" over and over. It's the principle of it, Lin, the principle. Yep, there it is. Wait, how did you know I was gonna say that? I've never said that. Right. Yeah. Right. It's the principle of the thing, sir. It's the principle! Prin... ci... ple! Oh, well, it is the principle. And someone's got to stand up for what's right! Things are pretty loud, so I'm just gonna put my fingers in my ears. Whoa, that's waxy! Am I shouting?! I'm going over there. (sighs) I'm going, too! No, you're not, Gene. It's a school night. This is my school now, Mom, the School of Hard Dads! So just call me Li'l Hard Dad! Yeah! But, no, not that. But, yes, he should come! If Gene wants to learn to be a man of action, this is taking action! Okay. Bye. Come on, Gene. Let's go get our refund! Refund road trip! I forgot my keys! Yeah, he did! Deal with it! Deal with it! Yeah! Look at us, just a boy and his dad, driving to get a refund. Ooh, I got chills just saying it. Well, Gene, it's... Wait, wait, wait, wait! Don't talk yet. I want to sample what you say and play it over and over until I've got heroic instincts coming out of every orifice of my body. Okay. Uh, it's not about being a hero, Gene. It's about doing what's right. Papa, do preach! And it is our duty, to mankind, really, to fight for justice. Some people say you have to learn to let things go. Well, you know what happens when you let things go? What?! What happens?! You drop the thing you're holding, Gene. And the thing I'm holding in this situation is this bag of crap. Nice! Listen to this. It's about doing what's right. (fart sound effect) Wow, I sound important. Powerful. Maybe take out the fart noise? No. It kind of makes you go, like, "Huh, good point" and also, "Good fart." Mom, Mom, look what I drew. It's me when I'm grown up, eating tacos with my monkey Sheila. Great, honey. Yeah. How's the reading coming, Tina? Oh, good. Really, really, really good. Good. Okay, fine! It's going terrible! I'm a slow reader! And then I get to a comma and I'm like, "Oh, I guess "they want me to pause, but for how long? How do I know when to stop pausing?!" I'm never gonna finish this book! Ah! And I'm gonna have to stand up there with the whole class staring at me and my armpits are gonna sweat and my boobs are gonna sweat and all the sweat's gonna meet in the middle and everyone's gonna know I didn't read the book! (grunts) Thank you. Tina, Tina, honey, listen. I'm gonna let you in on a little secret, mm-kay? I didn't read any of the books I did reports on in school. What? Oh, yeah, I've never read the book. Louise! What? You never read the book. Well, I mean, you should read the book. It's-it's better to read the book. We never read the book. How can you do a book report if you haven't read the book? You just got to give 'em a little show. Pizzazz 'em so they don't even notice that you didn't you-know-what. Pizzazz, that's up my alley. I once did a presentation on Catcher in the Rye with only a catcher's mask and a loaf of rye bread. Now, that one I failed, 'cause I didn't back-cover it. Back-cover it? Oh, my God, Mom, Let me slap her again. No, it's okay. Don't slap her again. Tina's learning. See, Tina, you can't judge a book by its cover, but you can judge it by its back cover. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh... Wait, I don't get it. All right, let me see. Let me see here. Dog named Buck, stolen from his home, forced to live as a sled dog in the cold, unforgiving Klondike region. Oh, my gosh, I'm getting so many ideas already! Musical numbers, choreography... Musical numbers? Louise, you're on props and costumes! I'm on lyrics and dance steps! Tina, go wash your face! We got a show to do! S. Felds. This is it. Let's give him hell! (over intercom): Hello? Sheldon? It's Bob. Go away. Okay, bye. No, Gene, come back. Right, right. Li'l Hard Dad. We're not leaving, Sheldon. Not until we get our money back for this defective helicopter! So do the right thing and give us a refund. Well put. Yep. You don't get it, do you, Bob? Sheldon Felds doesn't give refunds to heliflopters who crash on their first flight. Stop calling me a heliflopter! We don't care how fun it is to say! You see, I only sell those novelty toys to make ends meet. My real passion is customizing serious RC choppers. Well, what is that? This is my quad. I've made a few modifications for... poking purposes. (scoffs) That's dumb. Poke! Hey! Ah! Tickle, tickle. Tap, tap. Missed me! Stop-stop that. Ah! Ah! Hey, there's something on your shirt. What? Oop, got your nose! Quit it! Ah! So, shall I continue to masterfully poke you, or do you want to run along home? The latter! Good day, sir! No, we're not going anywhere. Okay then! Suit yourself, Bob! Wet Willy! Ah! How is that wet?! Linda: Oh, she looks great. You look great, hon. Maybe the best she's ever looked. Give us a twirl. See that tail? Real construction paper. Stunning. Thank you. Wag it a little honey, will you? (grunting) Wag it, wag it. Shake it, shake it. That a girl. All right, so let the Call of the Wild book report rehearsal begin! Tina, here's the lyrics for the opening number. Go ahead and sing it! Go on, girl. Okay. Ring, ring. (weakly):  Who's this calling on the phone?  It's the Wild, is anybody home?  Great lyrics, Mom. I know. But you got to belt it, honey. Let your voice do the reading that your eyes didn't do. That makes total sense. Uh-huh. So can you do it with vibrato? Like this?  Wild, wild!  (flat):  Wild...    No, that's n... Okay. You know what, try grabbing the skin on your throat and moving it around while you sing like this.  Na...  Like this?  Uh...  No. Let me try, let me try. (vibrating sounds) (coughing) Gentle! Gentle! Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. (groans) Maybe I should just transfer to St. Mathews. What? You think those nuns won't make you do book reports? People never stop making you read books, Tina. It's a sick world! You got to learn how to faux-dazzle it. Trust me. After tonight, you won't ever have to read a book again. I love you, Mom. Bob: So, Gene, I know it seems like we're hiding from Sheldon's helicopter in a Dumpster... Gene: Very much so. ...but we're actually just r-regrouping. And now I will calmly check outside... Oh, thank God. It's gone. I mean, regroup over. Uh, we can get out now. We don't have to get out on my account. I'm in my element. No, we are going to show Sheldon that we're still here and we'll never give up! Whoa. Whoa. What's that? Fish in the sky! This was in Revelations! Kirk Cameron was right! You done hiding, Bob?! We're not hiding, Sheldon! We were regrouping! And we still want our refund! Uh-huh. Swim, my pets. Swim! (chuckles) Your gently floating fish don't scare me, Sheldon! They're actually kind of pretty! It's a lot like snorkeling, which I've never done, but I imagine I would love it! Ow. Ow. Dad! You're sh**ting BBs at me! Ow! That one hit me in the nipple! That's his good nipple! My good nipple is bleeding! Are we done here, Bob?! You lose, I win! Also, I have a couple frozen pizzas in the oven, so I'm ready to wrap this up. No! We're not done! We're not? No! Two can play the game of having a helicopter that shoots stuff, Gene! Two can play! Wow, you sound really tough, even though you're holding your nipples. This is war, Sheldon! Man: Welcome to The Hobby Hole. I'm Terry, how can I help you? Hi, uh, weird question. Do you by any chance have any RC helicopters capable of actual warfare? Uh, we don't have anything like that, sir. (whispering): Follow me. Welcome to the world of RC helicopter warfare. Both: Whoa. I was hoping that would get a "whoa." We have to be pretty discreet about our warfare showroom, as you can imagine, but neat-o, huh? "Sky-sassin"? That sounds brutal. War is brutal. Of course, we advise you absolutely... do not aim these at people. Unless you hate them. Oh. Now, I need to know what kind of element we're dealing with here. Well, it's this guy who sold me a helicopter online, Sheldon Felds... Oh. What? Oh, man. What is it, Terry? Just stay away from Sheldon Felds. Wait, you know him? He used to work here. He was fired. Why? Let's just say Sheldon ate a lot of food out of the fridge in the break room that didn't belong to him and was clearly labeled. And when me and the rest of the Hobby Hole guys decided to gently approach him about it, he attacked us with helicopters. Hmm. You see this? One of Sheldon's BBs got lodged in there. And now I no longer feel comfortable wearing shorts. No! Trust me. You don't want to go up against Sheldon. Well, I am going up against Sheldon. He's on a whole other level. But I've got rightness on my side. Oh, you've got rightness on your side. Okay, then you're good. Really? You think so? No, but I just realized... why am I trying to stop you? I make commission on these. So let's get you all set up. Behold the Vanquisher. Whoa. Yeah, she's expensive. How expensive? $300. That's not much. But with that missile range, (chuckles) she's worth it. $300?! Of money? It's not about the money, Gene, it's about the principle. Yeah, it's about the principle. Terry, please. Teach me how to fly it. Huh, it's actually pretty, uh, intuitive. Yep, I probably don't need to be holding you like this. No, it helped. You know, before I let you go... good luck out there, buddy. Thanks. Okay, well, thanks for coming in. Linda: There you go. Mama's old tap shoes. How do they feel? A little loose, but, um, why am I wearing these? Because nothing's more distracting than tap dancing. When your toes are tapping, they think the reading must have happened. Now, follow me! And... a tap and a tap and a tap-tap-tap. And a tap and a tap and a... And we're tapping and we're spinning and we're spinning and we're tapping. Hold on. So when... And a shimmy tap, a shimmy tap. Wait, hold on. We're still spinning... A scooby tap, a scooby tap. Scoo-Scooby tap. A wiggle tap, a jiggle tap. Wait. What? And a shibba-dabba, shibba-dabba. (panting) Scooba-dooba-doo, and no one's even looking at you, what you didn't do, and a-scabba-dooba-scabba-dooba, scabba-dooba-day. Huh? And the book report's over, and you got yourself an "A"! Ah, maybe B-minus, probably, in my experience, you know. Hey. How's the tappin'? Great! She's like a jazzy jackhammer! Watch out, floor! Oh, yeah. So, I borrowed Teddy's wheelbarrow, and I made it look like a dogsled, and the only thing is, he said he wants to be in your book report, so I told him I'd pull some strings, get him a small part, and anyway, he's gonna meet you at school tomorrow, you can work it out then, okay? Cool? Is that cool? Very cool! You could tap with a wheelbarrow tied around you, right, hon? Uh... Got to get up higher somehow, so I can see onto his stupid balcony. Oh! I'll just climb up on that roof! (laughs) Uh... sure, that seems like a good idea... of something dangerous to do. Gene, you stay down there. Yup, no problem. Ugh! You're back. Yeah, I'm back, and I'm armed with righteousness and this! The Vanquisher. I see. Yeah, go inside, Sheldon... to get your checkbook! Like her? I call her the Vanquisherer. I got it from The Hobby Hole. And then I added the extra "er" when I customized the crap out of it. Vanquisherer? That's hard to say. No, it's not. You just slow down on the second "er." Vanquisher-rer? Look, the point is, it vanquishes Vanquishers! Well, not if I vanquish it first! Are you suggesting an air battle? Perfect! Air battle! I'm gonna make your precious helicopter look like the piece of crap True Lies one you sold me! But first, can I sh**t you with a missile in your nipple? I was really excited about it. Let me think. No. Air battle. All right, fine! On three. One... Not to interrupt, but is this the best way to solve this? Just asking. Yes! Yes. Two. (whirring) Aah, aah, aah. Three! I'm taking you down, Sheldon! You're gonna regret the day you... Oh, my God, you just hit me. That was quick. Time for the d*ath blow! Not the d*ath blow! Huh? What? Terry?! Me and the Hobby Hole boys thought you could use a little help. We did inventory and then we came right over! Join the battle, brothers! My favorite things were eating lunch and wearing shorts, Sheldon, and you took it all away! Now it's time to pay the price! I didn't eat your delicious roast beef and cheddar sandwich, Terry! But your chopper's gonna eat this! ("Ride of the Valkyries" plays) Aah. Aah! Aah! RC net attack! Aah! This one's for Jamie Lee! (yelling) (laughs, whoops) Whoa! Whoa! Oh! Oh, my. Whoa! No! Dad, you're on a ledge! Yeah, but we won the air battle! Yeah! How's Sheldon's expression, Gene? Is he sad? Is he crying? No, he's eating something, and he's got a new helicopter, and it's pointing at you. Ow! And there's a dart in your butt. Father! Everything's fine, Gene. I've got everything under control. Ow! Gotcha! Are you sure?! Yup. Ow! My butt! Hoo! Uh, Bob, should we get you a ladder or something? No, Terry! Take down Sheldon! Hobby Hole Boys, give him everything you got! (war cry) What? Wait, Dad! What about the ladder?! That seems like a pretty good idea. I mean, you're on a ledge, and you've got a butt full of darts! Yes, but I also have a butt full of... principles! Oh! So, yeah, you guys defeat Sheldon, and I'll just work on my upper-body strength, do some pull-ups, and I'll be out of here in no time. I can't... do even one! You're incredible, Bob. Time for the... Sky-sassin. Luckily, I have my Sky-sassin-assin! I'll go get it. Well, I'll wait for you. What is wrong with you hobbyists?!  Up here in the Klondike, it can get pretty cold  The other dogs are looking fierce  So it's time to get bold  But when life gets tough, well, you just got to smile  And better answer that phone  'Cause it's the call of the wild!  (whoops) Yes! (whoops) That moved me. So, yeah, you just do that. And no one will even know you didn't read it. Or I could just do it. Yeah, no, no, you should do it. You should do it. It's your thing. You do it. Right, right, right. Uh... Aah, aah! I can't! I can't do it! Aah! Aah! Aah! No, no, no, you'll be fine. Oh, yeah. You just remember all the steps. You got those. Memorize all the lyrics. Done. And don't mess it up. Boom. Uh! Okay! I'm-I'm gonna go to bed. Uh. Everything's gonna be fine. Okay. Uh. Good night! Yeah, get your beauty sleep. Oh, your wheelbarrow, hon. You might want to... Aah! Ah, she's fine. She's got this. We did good today, Mom. We did good. We did. Yeah. Hey, you want me to teach you how to get out of a speeding ticket? Yes! Sky-sassin! Destroy him, Terry, and I didn't catch all of your names, but you guys destroy him, too! Oh, that's Vance, and that's Will. Hi. Hey. Hey, Dad, remember this? Bob: Some people say you have to learn to let things go. I know you don't agree with them, but I'm starting to think maybe some people are right. Listen, here it is high-pitched like a little girl. (in high-pitched voice): Some people say you have to learn to let things go. Here it is super, super deep, like a monster. (in deep, distorted voice): You have to learn to let things go. Here it is with a beat under it. (upbeat tune plays) You have to learn to let things go. No matter how I play it back, Keyboard Dad sounds a lot smarter than Hanging from the Building Dad! I like the one with the beat. I came here today 'cause I thought I needed to learn to be a heroic man of action. But look at you. You're all nuts! Is anything worth all of this? I mean, Terry, I'm sorry you can't wear shorts. I would be devastated myself, but still! Also, just go to a doctor! Maybe sometimes the more heroic thing is to just let it the freak go! Now, who's gonna be the bigger man here, and just let it go?! I-I don't need a refund. I'll give you your refund. No, I said it first. I said it first! I'm the bigger man. No, I am! Sheldon, I'm sorry we ganged up on you about the food thing! I'm sorry I ganged up on all your food! Well, I forgive you! Thank you. Can I have my job back? No, you can't. It's not up to me. Remember Roger? He's in charge of it now. Can you believe it? Can someone just get a ladder already?! Bob: You know, Gene, in your own way, you kind of ended up saving the day today. Oh, thank God you finally said it. The whole car ride, I was, like, "Do I say it? No, he should be the one to say it. I'm not gonna say it." Well, I'm saying it, so, thanks. Huh. Today started with me wanting to learn from you, but then you learned from me. Does that make me your dad now? No. Do you want to switch for a while? I could take Mondays. Let's keep it like this for now. Well, you're still my hero, Dad. You're mine, too, Gene. Now how about we go inside and ice my butt? I wonder how many other dads are saying that to their sons right now. I bet a lot. Jocelyn: And that's why it truly was like a tale of two cities. But I feel like maybe next time, focus on the tale of just one city. And maybe that city is like a yogurt shop where cool teens work. I want to work there. Thank you. Okay, Jocelyn. Tina, you're up. Hi. Hi. Hi, everyone. Uh. Good job, Jocelyn. Thank you. (clears her throat) (sighs) (weakly): Ring, ring, ring. What did she just say? It's the... call of the... wild? Aah! I can't take it! I can't take it! (yelling) (kids gasp, Tina continues yelling) (grunting) Wow. Tina. That was, uh... Did you all see that? That was... Um, I... I'm-I'm sorry. ...amazing. Oh. You just embodied all the themes of the book. Huh. The primitivism, Buck's return to his savage nature. Yeah. The sweating. Great job. She was really good. That was really good. Well, I definitely read the book, so, thank you. Linda: Huh. She changed some things, but, uh, she still nailed it. She totally nailed it. So... say it, Bob. No. Say it. (sighs) You win best parent of the week. Yes! Yes! Me! I thought I won best parent of the week! Wait. How did you kids get out of class? Hey, don't worry about it. (panting): Did I miss it? Tina! Did I miss it? Linda: And a shimmy tap, a shimmy tap. A scooby tap, a scooby tap. A shibba-dabba, shibba-dabba, scooba-dooba-do, and no one's even looking at you, what you didn't do. And a-scabba-dooba-scabba-doo. Wiggle tap and jiggle tap. A shibba-dabba, shibba-dabba, scooba-dooba-do, and no one's even looking at you, what you didn't do. And a-scabba-dooba, scabba-dooba, scabba-dooba-day. The book report's over, and you got yourself an "A"! Ah, maybe B-minus, probably, in my experience. Shibba-dabba, shibba-dabba, shibba-dabba, shibba-dabba...
Teddy: Friday! So, any big weekend plans?  Date night tonight  Gonna go out, get some food  Have a few drinks  Forget we have kids for a little bit  La, yeah.  What's the plan?  I couldn't tell you if I wanted to. Only Bobby knows. He planned the whole thing. Yup. There will be dinner, drinks and entertainment. Ooh! The big three! Ha-cha-cha-cha! (door opens) And... we're home. Whoa, what's that? The class pet. I'm taking care of it this weekend. You're fine with it. I'm... not. The permission slip I signed for you says you're fine with it. You're into it. (sneezes) Ugh, what's wrong with it? Weird fur, seizures, runny nose, runny eyes, runny everything. Everybody's got their something. There wasn't anyone else who wanted to take it? Just Wayne. Who's Wayne? Kid in my class. We had a tiny disagreement about who should take the chinchilla home this weekend. No! No! No! No! No! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Well, congratulations, I guess. Just, um, keep it out of our room. Yeah, yeah, okay, Dad. Aw, was your little friend Wayne upset? Ah, no. He was easy breezy. Ah! Remember, bedtime is 7:00, not too much TV, no sugary snacks, and pet with the grain. Pet with the grain! Okay, don't forget. Your father and I are going out tonight, so you're gonna babysit, Tina, right? About that. Um... I was talking to some other girls, and did you know some people get paid to babysit? Oh, boy, she's onto us. Okay, let's start the negotiation. A thousand dollars and a parking space. How about three dollars an hour? Okay, deal. Three dollars every hour? Whoa, whoa, whoa. We get a cut of this, right, Tina? Okay. But you all got to be in bed by the time we get home, or nobody sees a dime. No problem... we can go to bed in our sleep. (singsongy): Ooh, Bobby! I'm excited to see where you're taking me. Lin, you don't have to cover your eyes. I never asked you to do that. I just want a big surprise. And surprises are better when you're blind. Well, take a look. We're here! Huh? "Stoolz." It gets better. Bing-a-ding, bing-a-ding- ding-ding-ding, brainiacs! This is your trivia master Dave letting you know that we are less than one minute away from trivia night! Trivia night? Ugh. When does it get better, Bob? Well, that was supposed to be the part where it got better. Y-You love trivia. I do? We played bar trivia that one time years ago. Remember? Yeah? We had fun. We did? I thought we did. We had a funny team name. We were Albert Beerstein. That's funny? Yes, it's funny! It works on many levels, Lin! But, look, we can go somewhere else if you want to. No, let's just get through date night. Right. Okay. Mm-hmm, great. Fine. Yup, get a drink. Yeah. Okay, trivia-meisters. Round one, question one. When I was 14, I had a crush especial on Puerto Rican actress Rosie Perez. Oh, we got this. It's gonna be White Men Can't Jump. In what year did the United States annex Puerto Rico? Oh. Um, it's, um... um... 19... something, something. You know what? The first question's always the hardest. All right, now that we got the easy one out of the way... Oh, crap. I mean, this will be fun. Yeah, it's fun, it's fun. It's like homework, but-but fun homework. How many rounds are there? Not-not many, but many. Tina: I just want you guys to know that even though I'm your paid babysitter tonight, I'm still your sister. But I'm getting paid. No feet on the couch. But I'm still your sister. For now. Until I get married off. All right, so, when you're with me, you're not called Princess Little Piddles. You are Shinobu. You like it? I know, it's great. This is Kuchi Kopi. You're both little troublemakers. You're both huge in Japan. You probably have a lot to talk about... go! Keep things light. Don't bring up your divorce. Or Nixon. Or Radiohead. (phone ringing) Belcher residence. Both my parents are home tonight and they're black belts. Uh, it's for you, Louise. Really? Hello? Hey, Louise. Wayne here. Uh, so how's Princess Little Piddles? Fine. Great talk. Bye-bye. Wait! Put Princess on the phone. What? Put Princess Little Piddles on the phone! Why? Princess Little Piddles! Can you hear my voice?! Are you okay?! (groans) Bye. (doorbell rings) I'll get it since I'm in charge. While I'm gone, Gene's in charge. Louise, if Gene can't handle his duties, it's all you, sister. I can handle my doodies, thank you! (panting) I couldn't stop him! He barreled right past me like a really fast barrel! Oh, my God, Wayne, you were calling from outside my house? (shrieks, gasps) Out of cage! Out of cage! Okay, you're acting nuts, Wayne. Oh, you mean nuts for responsibility?! Like nut, crazy, bad, rotten nut! Responsible handsome head nuts maybe?! No, no way! Just nuts! No, handsome nuts! I know nuts! No, like cashews! Um, excuse me! I hate to interrupt a productive dialog, but where'd the chinchilla go? (shrieks) Uh, he's around here somewhere. (screams) Stop screaming and help me look, Wayne! Why is the front door open? Maybe God closed a window? Edith: Chinchilla! Disgusting! Oh, no, no, no, no! Hey, mama! There he is! (squeaking) Oh. Hey, little, guy. It's Jonas. Gene: Oh, good, he's bringing him back. Jonas! Hey! You found our chinchilla! Thank you! What? I can't hear you! Bye! No! No! No! No! Wait! Wait! Wait! No! Oh, my God! What just happened?! It ran away and joined the worst biker gang in the world. Oh, Princess Little Piddles has been abducted! This is all your fault, Louise! What?! This is your fault, Wayne! You barged in to my house and left the door open! I was barging! Bargers are not responsible for closing the door! It's not a disaster. Jonas is the delivery boy at Reggie's Deli. We'll just go to Reggie's. We shouldn't be out! We should be back home! I'm not certified for outdoor child care! Tina, we're under your care, but this chinchilla is under my care, which technically falls under your jurisdiction. Right? I guess that's true. Or it might not make any sense at all... Well, we'll be back home in 20 minutes. All right, let's go to Reggie's. Aw, crap! Reggie's is closed. Oh, now what?! We smash Reggie's window and make some sandwiches and go from there. No, we go to where Reggie lives, and we ask him where Jonas lives. You want to know where Jonas lives? Well, take a number. Just kidding. Deli humor. Quit pussyfooting around! The address, Reggie! Uh, Jonas is at his friend Clay's house doing homework. Clay is at Jonas's house doing homework. What the...? Isn't he? How can they both be at each other's houses? Maybe they broke the space-time continuum. Must've been some homework. Unless it's an excuse teenagers tell their parents when they don't want them to know where they're going. But where would that be? A secret teen event of secrecy? You mean a party? Yes! Tina, thank you! Is that Teddy?  I...  Wish my radio worked.  Oh, no! If Teddy sees us out of the house, he'll tell Mom and Dad. Everyone hide! (gasps) Huh? Oh, geez. Thought I saw Harvey. Ah, that was close. Listen. Why don't we go home, make a decoy chinchilla out of pipe cleaners and socks to buy ourselves some time? No, Tina, we're looking for a party. What do you know about high school parties? Nothing, but I might know someone who might know something. (doorbell rings) (groans) What do you maxi-sads want? Dave: Okay, after round one, in first place are the DILFs. In second place, Old Kevin. And in last place, with no correct answers, are the Date Nights of the Round Table. (whoops) Hey! First couple ever here on a date! I guess the romance doesn't revolve around knowing things, because they don't. (laughs) Hey, hey! Easy, Mr. Questions! Just kidding, just kidding. (whispering): I'm not kidding. They can't hear me. They don't know anything. Oh, my God, we're losing. And now we're getting heckled. I guess we can just go home. All right, let's get out of here. Let me just go to the bathroom. Round two, question one. Hiking is stupid. How many miles long is the Appalachian Trail? I was hoping there'd be more questions about '80s TV shows. (quietly): Bob, I did something bad. In the bathroom? No! Look! I stole an answer sheet from Dave's folder! We got all the answers! What?! Lin, are you crazy? We can't cheat. Oh, yeah, we don't want to cheat against Dave. He's such a good guy. Uh... Write down the answer, Bob. Write it down! Okay, okay. Not like that, like you just thought of it. You look at the ceiling, you say, "Hmm," and then you look down. Hmm. Yeah, yeah. That's it, that's it. I might be able to find out which high school party this Jonas kid is at, but why would I want to help a bunch of babies get their cat back? It's not a cat, it's a chinchilla! Anything that's not a dog is a cat to me. We'll owe you. You name it. Anything, anytime. What if I want Tina to kiss a dirty flip-flop at 3:00 a.m. on a Tuesday? Let's not go crazy... Of course. Yes. That. No, no, no. I'm gonna think of something good to make Tina do later when I'm feeling really bad about myself. But we've got a deal. Whoa, that's a lot of technology. We get it. You have e-mail. (groans) I'm using social media to triangulate Jonas's whereabouts. Look. Jonas is friends with David Schnabel, who just tweeted at Vanessa Jackson "See you at Casey's party." And according to Leilani LeFelt's secret blog she thinks no one knows about, Jonas has a huge crush on Vanessa. So that means Jonas is at Casey's party. Voila. All right, troops, wheels up, we're flying! I-I don't think we can go to a high school party, Louise. Mom and Dad will k*ll me. There'll be high school boys there. Right. Maybe we can just do a quick pop-in. Oh, wait, you think you're gonna get into that party? Oh, you are never gonna get in. I wouldn't even get in, and I'm the hottest girl in eighth grade. You're in eighth grade? I thought you were someone's mom. Trust me, Tammy. Getting in is gonna be the easy part. I've gotten into the teacher's lounge so many times I have my own coffee mug there. It says "I Hate Mondays." Classic. Mm... I'm cashing in my favor. If you can get me into that party, we're even. Let's go! Every minute of our life is five minutes of a chinchilla's life! Aha! Here's our ticket into this poop show. How is trash gonna help us? Oh, Wayne. Watch and learn. (doorbell rings) Well, someone did. What? Did you say, "We didn't order any pizza"? No. Well, someone did. And old man pizza boss is gonna have my ass if I don't deliver it. Where's the bathroom? Uh, down that way. Thanks. I'll be out of there in 30 minutes or less. Hang on, Atlas. We're coming, buddy. Who's Atlas? (sighs) It's my secret name for Princess Little Piddles. Really? Huh. I call him Shinobu. Princess Little Piddles... it just isn't right. I know. Fourth graders shouldn't be in charge of names. Or s*x determination. He has testicles for God's sake! I know! I told them, "Guys, those are testicles!" No one believed me! Everyone thought they were butt boobs! (grunts) I can't believe that worked. Whew! Well done, Gene. Aw... are you going to the bathroom? Um... no? Oh, my God! Oh, a high school party is no place for a small animal! They're probably playing Spin the Chinchilla with him right now! Uh, let's just focus here. If you were a teenager with a chinchilla, where would you be? Chinchilla-con. So this is our first high school party. Let's savor this moment. High school boys' butts are higher up, I'm noticing. Okay, incoming teen dream, two o'clock... if I'm using that term correctly, which I don't know, because I actually can't tell time on those round clocks. Ring the flirt alarm, here I go. Yeah, it's just like ding-dong, ring-a-ding, let this rip. Hey, what grade are you guys in? (moans) (babbles) Forget it. Bye. I can't feel my arms! I can't move! Oh, God, he was taller than my dad! Oh, God, another one's coming! (panting) (babbling) On the lnternet, you can be whoever you want, and no one will ever know. Where does the word "modem" come from? (whispering): Should we get this one wrong? Just to not look suspicious? No. We know this one. We don't know it... we're cheating. Well, now we know it, and we're not getting it wrong. Okay. (loudly): You know the answer, DILFs? Old Kevin? Because we do. (imitates modem) Lin. What? What is that? It's a modem. I'm making modem noises at them. It-it's more like this. (imitates modem)   (both imitating modems) Okay, good modem noises, Date Nights of the Round Table. Now back to the questions. (both imitating modems) Dave: Okay, okay! Tina. What? I have to fart. It's a fear fart. I... (grunts) I can't hold it. Tammy, no! You can't fart at a high school party. I know that! Don't you think I know that?! Okay, I'm gonna fix this, honey. Can you hold it real tight until I get you to a window? I'm gonna pick you up now. (both grunt) Gentle. Don't squeeze. (both grunt) Excuse us. Coming through. Just a couple of normal teenagers partying. Hi. How are you? How are you doing? Go, go. (farts) (sighs) Tina, you literally just saved my life. I am not gonna forget this until the day I die. That's so... Oh, my God, this girl farted! Right here, over here! What? I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Nobody's listening to us. Jonas... bingo. Whoa. Knock-knock. Who's there? Uh, you guys. You guys who? That's right, you're not supposed to be here. Give us the chinchilla, Jonas. It's ours. It's the fourth-grade class pet, for crying out loud. What? Oh, well, sorry, I didn't know that. I thought he was a gremlin, and I was like, "What? Gremlins are real?" Anyway, I gave him to Vanessa. What?! What?! Where's Vanessa? She took it, went off with some of her friends, and they were like, "Girls only, except these three guys." (chuckles) Where did they go? I don't know. They were talking about going roller-skating. Wherever you do that. The roller rink, maybe? Oh, yeah. Oh, I'm gonna slap you. What? Ow, my moneymaker! Here, let me see that for a second. Ow! Oh, you found Jonas. Hi, Jonas. Hey... you, girl. Whew, I was afraid you wouldn't remember me. Does this mean we got the chinchilla back? Because Mom and Dad could be home any minute. No. Jonas gave him away, and now he's at a roller rink. (groans) Jonas, what does Vanessa look like? I don't know. She has hair and pants. Great description... you should work for the FBI. Listen, you're coming with us to point out who she is. Why would I do that? You guys belong together. You have the thing, she has her thing. Yeah, it's the opposite of "opposites attract." This is Jonas time. This is what you've been training for. You got to go with us. Oh, my God. Let's go! I'm coming, Shinobu. I'm coming, Atlas. I'm coming, roller rink snack bar hot dogs! All right, there's the rink. Let's go get our chinchilla. Oh, God, you don't think they have strobe lights in there, do you? Probably. Why? Strobe lights give him seizures. Oh, right, the strobe light incident. Why did Alfonz bring a strobe light to show and tell? Wayne: Ugh, 'cause his grandfather invented it. Oh, my God, is that Teddy again? Ugh, pad thai is not good driving food. Uh, everyone freeze! Huh? Why are we freezing? If we don't move, he can't see us. Is that true? Maybe. Hold your breath! Oh, sh**t, I just remembered I'm allergic to peanuts. (hacks) I'll be all right. I'll be all right. (hacks) Oh, my God, it worked. Tina's a wizard. Do something else. Make a jean jacket appear on me. Jean jacket! (Dave imitates air horn) It's time for the final round. And incredibly, the seemingly dimwitted Date Nighters have rocketed into first place. Yeah, Date Nighters! We're smart, and cute! Cuter than the DILFs! (booing) Yeah. All right, okay, settle down. Question one: I've never been a carpenter or on a boat, but Kurt Russell did both in what 1987 movie? (whispering): Lin, where's the answer sheet? Uh... (gasps) Oh, no, it fell. Oh, God, get it, Lin. You're closer. Shh, I got it, I got it. (loudly): Oops, I dropped some hummus. Hello, just getting that hummus there. Okay. We love hummus. Hey, what's that? What? That's an answer sheet. Nah. Uh, yeah, definitely. No. No, no. You were cheating, you're cheating. Cheaters! No one's cheating. No. Total cheaters! Full-on cheaters! Okay, you know what? We were cheating. I took my wife here on date. We have about three of these a year. In a good year. And I brought her to bar trivia. I screwed up. And you didn't help, Dave. You made us feel stupid, just because we didn't know the answers to any of the questions. I know that was fun for Kevin. (laughs) I know, I know. But my wife found a way to make this date night fun, and, damn it, I'm not sorry about that. So sweet. You're out of here! Deborah! No, it... Hands off, Deborah. Hey! Ow! (grunts) Wow, I'm sorry, Lin. That was, uh... worth it. (whoops) Hot one. Next date night, let's cheat at karaoke. Louise: All right, Jonas, where's Vanessa? Where's my chinchilla? Our chinchilla. Okay, Vanessa, love of my life. Let's see. There she is! Let's go, let's go! Time to roll my way into Vanessa's heart. Vanessa, where's the chinchilla? What? Princess Little Piddles! What's "Piddles"? He's our class pet. Oh, I'm sorry, little kids, but that security guard offered me 40 bucks for it. Oh, my God! How could you? It was easy. He was like, "Here's $40." And I was like, "Here you go." (groans) Come on! Oh, Vanessa, that kid Jonas likes you, and you should give him a chance. Or not. Your call. What? I can't hear you. The music's too loud. I got to skate. Hey, Vanessa! Wait for me! Hey, sir? Yeah. Can you push me towards that girl over there? All right. (grunts) He touched my butt. Excuse me, hi. That thing you paid $40 for, it's ours. You guys smoke weed? No, the chinchilla you paid $40 for. What? No, no, no. That's gonna be a present for my landlord. I'm a little short on rent this month. Why didn't you give him the $40? Hey, you're a smart kid. Where were you five minutes ago? Over there. Sorry, buddy, but the chinchilla already belongs to Miss Labonz's fourth-grade class. (sighs) I guess I have to do the right thing. You have 40 bucks? We can write you a check. Do you have a check? I do. Uh-oh. What? Okay, if you were a chinchilla, and you were a rascally little son of a b1tch that wouldn't stay in a box, where would you be? No! Damn it! Here, Shinobu. Here, thingy. Atlas, Atlas. Here, thingy, thingy. Javier. Shinobu. Where are you? Oh, wait, is that him? Or is that a loose furry skate? Ah! He's gonna get k*lled out there! Look out, coming through! Move it, people, move it! (whip cracks) Huh? Announcer: You know what that means. Time for The Whip! (whip cracks) (gasps) Hang on, Shinobu! I'll protect you, Atlas! You okay? I'm okay. (vomits) (groans) Let's get out of here, quick. Go, go, go! Uh-oh, we have a vomit situation. Look out, skaters, the floor gets slippery when wet. (gasps) Vanessa! (thud) No! Vanessa: Oh, gross! Oh, God. I like her less now. Tina: Please let Mom and Dad not be home. Please let Mom and Dad not be home. Please let Mom and Dad not be home. Mom? Dad? Oh, thank God, they're not home. Well, Wayne, we did it. Yeah, we did. You were great out there on the rink. You came through, big-time. You, too. So I'll hold Atlas while you go collect his things. Oh, my God, after all we just went through to get him back, you're still acting like this? You still want to take him home? Don't forget his water bottle. And, hurry, 'cause if he's gonna get a story tonight, I have to get him home soon. You know what, why don't we just let him choose who he wants to stay with? (scoffs) I've cared for him every weekend for a year, so I think I know who he's gonna pick. Perfect. You stand there, I'll stand here, Put him down in the middle, Tina. Okay. Come to Wayne, Atlas. Come here. Shinobu. (kissing) Come on, come to Wayne. Come here, baby. Come on, Atlas. Atlas. Come here, come, come, come. Ah, yes! Take that, Wayne. He loves me, not you. He's sick of your boring rules! Okay, he's made his choice. Well, I guess I'll get going. Uh... have a good weekend. Uh, don't you want to say good-bye to Shinobu? Oh, no, I'll... I'll see you Monday. That didn't feel as great as I thought it would. I mean, it still feels great, but just not as great. My theory is that Wayne is really sad because you made him think the chinchilla doesn't love him. Why don't we all go get in bed really fast, and think about whether Gene is right. Go, go, go! Hi. Why did some kid just run out of here crying? There's always kids running out of here crying. What are you still doing up? Oh, hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. We weren't out or anything. We were home all night. Okay. You saying that makes me think you maybe... Hey, you know what, this one's on me. You don't even have to pay me. High school party? What? (chuckles) W-Wait, hold on a second. What's wrong with Louise? Louise, honey, you okay? I think I need a ride somewhere. Mm... no. What are you doing here? Hey, so after you left, Shinobu seemed real down and kind of off. He wasn't sneezing or anything, like, not a single seizure. Really? Oh. Anyway, I guess maybe he missed you. He did? I just don't think he's gonna be happy at our place. Plus, my dad's simple and doesn't know his own strength. Oh, I can see that. I mean, your dad looks like he'd sit on anything. Oh, he has. I'm right here. So you better just take him. I don't think he even likes me. (whispers): Stop it, play along. Tell me how it goes on Monday, will you? Okay, thanks, bye. Bye. That was nice, Louise. That was really, really sweet. Ugh, I know. You know, me and your mom cheated at trivia tonight. Really? Yup. Impressed? What's wrong with you? You took her to trivia? Sounds like you cheated Mom out of a date. There's my girl. Linda:  Date night tonight  Gonna go out, get some food  Have a few drinks, forget we have kids for a little bit  La, yeah  Date night tonight, yeah  Gonna go out, get some food  Have a few drinks, forget we have kids for a little bit  Gonna go out, get some food  Have a few drinks, forget we have kids for a little bit  La, yeah  It's just what we do  Date night, date night, date night  Gonna go out... 
I can't believe we're at school on a Saturday. The Cotton Candy Festival is today at Wonder Wharf! I heard they have unusual and exotic flavors. Like lasagna. And chimichurri! Well, you'll never know since you'll all be in detention. Dad, Tina will give you all the money in her bank account if you take us to Wonder Wharf right now. Please? By the time we get out of detention, the festival will be over. Well, you should've thought about that before you got in trouble. Good kids eat cotton, bad kids eat notton'. I can't believe you won't go to detention for me. I already told you, if I could I would, but I can't fit into your clothes, Tammy. You know I want to. You want to go to detention for me or you want to wear my clothes? J-Just go. Mom, I can't believe I got detention. Don't even worry about it. You're, like, really pretty. All day, huh? Oof, this is gonna suck for you, really. Hey, there's Bob. Hey, Belcher! You got three kids in detention, huh? Yeah, Jimmy. I only got one. I win! Well, I... had none in... detention yesterday! How many did you have in... Don't roll up your window! (yelling indistinctly) Roll it back down! (tires screech) Mr. Frond: Well? Do any of you have anything to say for yourselves after what happened yesterday at school? I have something to say. I'd like to apologize on behalf of Tammy. She's a horrible person who caused all of this, and everyone should be released from this hell pit except her. Thank you. You're a liar without a hair dryer. This is your sister's fault! I'm a boy! Not you, Gene. Tina. She caused all of this. If by "caused" you mean "didn't cause," then, yeah, I caused this. High five. Sure. Ow. Too hard. From what I remember, this was caused by one thing and one thing only: fashion. (sighs) Okay, so this is it. Day one with my new look. I can't believe I'm wearing this at school. I barely recognize you. Maybe I shouldn't do it. No, no. If you want to dazzle, you got to take razzles. That's a dazzling way to say "risks." You take fashion risks with your fashion wrists. Hi, how are you guys? They're speechless, Tina. They don't know what to say because they've never seen anything so original. I think you're right. Guys, this is going great. (gasps) (gasps) Oh, my God! Tina's wearing the same bracelet as you, Tammy! Tina, you need to take that off right now. Sparkle jelly bracelets are my thing since yesterday when I bought it. Yeah. Tammy, I understand you're disappointed. I'm a little disappointed, too. Before I saw it on you, I thought this bracelet was classy. Take... it... off. I... would... rather... die. Then you will die! (all shouting) Get off my sister! Hey! You guys playing Red Rover? Send Zeke on over! I don't know what to do! The fire department will fix this! (fire alarm ringing) Yeah! Foam party! (shouting) Detention! Saturday! All of you! What?! Admit it, Tina, the only reason you wore that sparkle jelly bracelet was because you wanted to copy me, okay? That's not true. I wore it because I wanted to make a statement without saying a word. Mm-kay, well, I have a statement for you then. (grunts) Darn it! Ugh! Why can't I fart when I want to? Where are the kids? They got detention, Teddy. On the day of the Cotton Candy Festival? That's rough. Wish I could go, but I can't trust myself. You think you're gonna get one, maybe two cottons, next thing you know you're getting kicked out of the festival, and they take away your car keys. Right. Hi, sweetie. Can I help you? Hi. Good afternoon. My name is Sally. I hope that you're enjoying your day. Would you like to buy some magazine subscriptions to help me learn communication skills, help me buy textbooks, and send me on a trip to Turtle Camp in Florida? I'm only 283 points away from my goal. Turtle Camp? Uh, no, thanks. We're-we're not interested. At all. Aw. I love turtles. What do you do at camp? You get in a little canoe with them? Do turtle crafts? You can select up to ten magazines from any of these titles for only $17. That sounds like a great deal. Where do I sign? (quietly): Fake. This is fake. Not real. I'll take a look! Fake. Let me see what you got. Jacuzzi Enthusiast. Ooh, they got Lotion Monthly. Ooh. Ooh, ooh. Aw, Healthy Babies Digest. Aw... (quietly): Lin, th-they never send you the magazines. You will start receiving issues within 30 days. Uh, hold on one second, Sally. Quick conversation over here with my wife. Lin, no. They have Open-Toe Living. Linda, it's a scam. You give them money, and they just take it. Sally's a scammer? Our Sally? Somebody's scamming her, too. They put her up to it. What are we talking about over here? Somebody is scamming Sally. b*st*rd! We got to help her. Or we can just nicely ask her to leave. No, Bobby. We lost three kids to detention today. We're not losing Sally, too. (sobs): Sally! What? Nothing, Sally! Nothing. Uh, no. Fashion has become toxic here at Wagstaff. Believe it or not, even I have been the recipient of what some people call a "fashion thrashin'." (urinating) Wha... What?! Wh-What? "More like sweater mess"? That night, I was upset. But instead of lashing out in anger, I turned to the needle. That's right. The knitting needle. I rehabilitated myself with fashion. That's an emotional-ass story, Mr. Frond. Fashion should be a form of expression, not a weapon to tear people down. That is why I have decided to team you up and pitch you against each other in a fashion contest. So far, this all makes sense. Uh, no, thanks. If you need me, I'll be zoning out pretty hard over here. And I'm gonna sleep with my eyes open. Like this. (snoring) Fine. Fine, fine, fine, fine! The winning team will be allowed to leave detention three hours early. Wait, what? Seriously? We can go to the Cotton Candy Festival! Mr. Frond, you got yourself a fashion contest. Welcome to... Scared Fabulous! (quietly): Hey, Tina. How about a side bet? Winner gets to wear the sparkle jelly bracelet. Loser has to throw theirs in the trash. Deal. We've got a deal like Ally McBeal. We've got a deal like Steven Spiel... berg. Welcome to Scared Fabulous. You will divide into teams and face three challenges. You'll sketch designs, collect materials, and construct outfits on your CPR dummy. Good news for us, 'cause that dummy looks hot in anything. Then one of you will walk your design down the runway. You will have three impartial judges with a keen sense of fashion: Ms. Schnur, Coach Blevins and Mr. Branca. What? The big three? Aren't they all supposed to be in Milan this week? They're the only other faculty members who happen to be in the building today. I'm on Tammy's team! I want to be on Zeke's team. Someday we're gonna start our own men's fashion line then live in a van! Yeah! Called Fancy Pants! You're gonna fance the way you pants. I guarantee it! Fine, then. The last team will be the Belcher kids. There are three of you, but I don't really see that as an advantage. Don't underestimate us. Our family's motto is, "Maybe we'll get lucky this time." I thought it was, "Stop touching that! You're getting it all greasy!" Linda: How's the burger, Sally? You like it? It's fine. Thanks. So, are you guys gonna buy any magazines? No, Sally, 'cause your life is a lie. What? Linda. Sorry, Sally. Uh, what my wife is trying to say is that there are no magazines. You're-you're involved in a scam. Somebody is using you. But I'm only 283 points away from reaching my goal. Sally! There are no points! (gasps) What? There is no goal! But... There are no turtles! Oh. You got to get out! What happened to the turtles? Linda, calm down. I guess I'm gonna get going. Uh, okay, yeah, but did you get what we were talking about here? Give me a quick hug! We'll, I'm not supposed... (grunts) Sally. I got to be on my way, but, uh... sorry to, uh... sorry to, uh... sorry to, uh... sorry to bother you. Bye, Sally. What a nice girl. Wait, where's my purse? My purse! Oh, there it is. There it is. Everything's okay. My fries! You ate them, Teddy. Oh, okay. Can I get another fry over here please? Mr. Frond: All right. I just got off the phone with Principal Spoors' voicemail. I feel like the message went really well, and I think what we're looking at here is a pilot program that will probably go national. So, Ms. Schnur, what is the first challenge? For my challenge, I want each team to design an outfit that I can wear over a three-day holiday weekend. All right, Schnur, what are we talking here? Martial arts tournament? Canadian pill run? Antiquing? No. I'm just gonna sit on the couch all weekend and watch a David Schwimmer movie marathon. Great! Okay, designers, time to make her fab while you rehab. Ms. Schnur wants to sit on the couch for three days. Gene, you were born to design this outfit. I'm like the Steve Jobs of sitting on the couch for three days. Tina, you can be our model. Uh, I don't know. I'm not very good at walking. You're getting better. Just keep your head high, pick your knees up, and make every step a glamorous stomp. You mean like a horse? Mm... yeah.     (grunting) Clip-clop, girl! I'm in. All right, designers, you each have five minutes to collect your materials. Are we going to the fabric store? No! Oh. For this challenge, you can only use materials from Ms. Schnur's supply closet. And your time starts... now! Go, go, go, go, go, go! Ugh, you copied my bracelet, Tina, and now you want to take my stapler? Why don't you staple your mouth shut, 'cause your face keeps falling open and dumb words keep coming out. Mine! No...! Oh, there's another one right here. Mr. Frond: Welcome to the runway. As you know in fashion, one day you're in, the next day you're rehabilitated. And out free in the world eating cotton candy to shove it in your face, the whole thing. The winner of this challenge will receive immunity in the next round. Let's start the show! (dance music playing) (grunting) J-Ju's wearing the Couch-fit! For the d... For those days you just don't want to get off the couch, now you don't have to. 'Cause you are the couch. Spin. Looking good, girl! Ha. Mmm, mmm, mmm... It doesn't matter if she's out on the town or in on the couch, we wanted Ms. Schnur to look fun and flirty, not gross and dirty. This is me right now. And... clip-clop. Clip-clop. (grunting) Ladies and gentlemen, I introduce to you the Adult Bib. The pockets are lined with aluminum foil to keep your chicken wings warm. (quietly): We got this, Gene. Tina looks great out there. Horsey but good. Ah! Oh, no! My nephew through the years! Oh, nice one, Tina. Uh, good luck winning after you ruined Ms. Schnur's family forever. Uh... Mr. Frond: Now it's time to pick a winner and see who will get immunity and move directly to the final round. Zeke, Jimmy Jr., I found your look incredibly offensive. I am not a couch. Tammy, Jocelyn, your flirty outfit would send the wrong message to the Chinese food delivery guy. His name is Enrique, and he's already very forward with me. Belcher children, your model fell over and destroyed all my photographs of Nathan. Ms. Schnur, it's time to announce your decision. The winner of this challenge is... Come on, Schnur. Get us to that sweet, sweet cotton candy. ...Tammy and Jocelyn. (groans) Yay! We're popular! Yes! Yes! Sparkle jealous, much? Blah, blah, blah much? That's you. I want cotton candy much! That's me! Kids, welcome to round two. Coach Blevins, tell the designers about their next challenge. Uh, I just came in today to pull up these old wrestling mats because they're full of, uh, blood and spit. Mm-hmm. Also, I need to throw out these jerseys. They're from the '60s, and they have high levels of bacteria. Yeah, but isn't bacteria just a myth? So let's just say the materials for this challenge will be wrestling mats and old jerseys. Now, tell them what kind of outfit you want. Well, next Saturday, I have a wrestling meet in the morning, traffic school in the afternoon and salsa dancing at night. So I guess I need an outfit that's a triple threat: coaching, getting my license back, dancing. You heard the man. Let's get started, designers. Tammy: Good luck, designer-whiners! We have immunity! That means we don't have to design an outfit this round, and we can never die. Just the first thing. The second thing is incorrect. (doorbells jingle) Excuse me. Hi. Can I help you? Did you tell this girl that she was part of a scam? Um, a little bit? Who are you? I'm Trish, and I've been helping girls like Sally get communication skills, textbooks and trips to Florida for the last 16 years. Oh, okay. So you're the one behind the whole fake Turtle Camp thing? Fake Turtle Camp thing? Do you know what these girls learn down there? They learn to come out of their shell. Yup. Let me tell you a story, huh? Once upon a time, there was a little girl. And she used to stutter with a lisp, like this. Th-th-th-th-th-th-th. And then she sold magazines and went to Turtle Camp, and everything changed. (gasps) Was it you? Yes. Let's say yes. These magazines change lives. Oh, my God, Bobby, it's not a scam. We had it all wrong. Uh, yeah. Still think this is a bunch of crap. It-it just seems like you're asking girls to sell magazines and then taking the money. Okay, you know what else a turtle can do? Huh? Do you know? A little turtle, what can it do, hmm? It can snap! Snapping turtles! So do you want to see me snap, hmm? No. Or do you want to buy some magazines? (groaning) Calm down. What are you doing? Okay, okay, take it easy. Oh, no! Bobby, she's pulling up the counter! Do... you... want to buy any... magazines?! Say yes, Bobby! Say yes! Oh! God, I'm going crazy! Okay, do you have any magazines about cooking? We have Cooking in the Kitchen. Great. I'll get my checkbook. Get your checkbook. Get it! I'm getting it! Hurry! I can't find it! Okay, the designs are complete. Let's tear them apart metaphorically. (grunting) Coach Blevins will be sporty and spicy in this one-piece, all-day dress shirt. Mm-hmm. You'll notice the design is backless, which is perfect for salsa dancing and gettinyour license back. (grunting wildly) Come on! Zeke is wearing a traditional Japanese samurai outfit. 'Cause there is nowhere this outfit doesn't fit in and stand out. Coach Blevins, it's time to announce the winner of this challenge and who will face Tammy and Jocelyn in the final round! Uh, I honestly don't know anything about fashion. Can we just call it a tie? No, we cannot call it a tie. It's fashion. There has to be a winner and a loser. Pick one! Um, maybe they should just wrestle for it. That's how I usually settle things in my gym class. Fine, then. If that's what it takes for you to pick a winner, then we'll have them wrestle. Wait. What? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Go! Yeah! This is my kind of fashion show! Gene, get over here! I'm gonna get ya! Come on! Come on! I just ironed this outfit! Aah! (phone ringing) Oh, hello, Principal Spoors. We're right in the middle of a fashion show. I assume you're calling about that? It's-it's a little hard to hear you. Wh-What were you saying? Stop it! Oh, you... you what Scared Fabulous? You hate it. Okay. Like, ironically? Hey, Tina! You guys are gonna lose! So bracelet in your facelet is what I'm talking about! You want to go, Tammy? Want to go?! Yeah! I'd like to talk to you more, a little more, about the... Oh. Okay, right. No morlls on the weekend. Got it. Right. Bye. So, designers, I just spoke with Principal Spoors, and there have been some new developments. Scared Fabulous will abruptly end now, and we'll all be returning to class where detention will resume as usual. All: What?! What about the finals? And the Cotton Candy Festival! Whoa, Mr. Frond, hold on. You're gonna let Principal Spoors just shut down our rehabilitation? It was a mutual decision. (chuckles): Oh, I get what's going on. He didn't think you were qualified to run a fashion-based at-risk youth program. Maybe another teacher will have to do it. Someone with, say, a knack for fashion. Uh, I... I'm Wagstaff's fashion guy. I'm a better designer than all of you combined. I could sew you under the table. Oh, really? Well, why don't you put your knitting needles where your mouth is? One last challenge... all of us against you. Mr. Branca judges. Right, Mr. Branca? I like clean lines and simple silhouettes. Ugh. No. I don't want to work with Tina. I won't do it. Tammy shush. I'm getting us out of here. I don't want to work with Tina. I don't... I... Stop it! Just shush. Shush! If you win, we'll tell Principal Spoors that you scared us fabulous, and that you're the best dressed man we've ever seen. But if we win, (chuckles) we all get to leave early. I'm a knitter, not a quitter. Kids, you're on. All right! Hell yeah! Oh, my God, yeah! Let's do it. You can take our Saturday morning, but you'll hopefully never take away our mid-to-late Saturday afternoon! Let the ultimate challenge begin. The fashionista versus the detentionistas. I can't believe I have to work with Tina. She smells like failure, and her hair smells like ketchup. It's not like I want to work with you, either, Tammy. And you're wrong. My hair doesn't smell like ketchup. My skin does. Oh. You guys, try to keep it together for one last challenge. We'll all get out of here, and you can hate each other on the outside. Let me paint a picture. I am president in the old country. The revolution is underway. The rebels have charged into my palace, dragged me onto the street, and are demanding justice. I must give a speech. I want you to design a look that will save my life using a material that I now work with every day in your wonderful country. Trash. You have 20 minutes. Dig! Let's go! Let's go! Bob: So what do we owe you? Let's call it $160. Hmm. That's not how much magazines cost. (doorbells jingle) Jimmy: Hey, Bob. Just wanted to check how many kids you were gonna be picking up from detention. Still three? Not now, Jimmy. We're in the middle of something here. Yeah? What are you talking about? What are you doing? You know what? Just... Nah, you-you wouldn't be interested. Ha! Yeah, you're right. But, uh, you know, tell me so I can not be interested. Well, we were just using some of our profits to help Sally here with her textbooks and communication skills and Turtle Camp. Just some philanthropy. You know, giving back to the community. We bought 20 magazine subscriptions, but it's not a big deal. Nothing you'd be interested in. 20? That's dumb. I could buy 40. I don't think you could. Oh, yeah, I could easily. I give back like a son of a b1tch. Hey, uh, why don't you guys come over to my place after you're done here? I'll take two of everything. Whoa! Yes, sir! You got it.  Ha-da doo-dee.  You should receive your first issues in ten to 12 to 18 weeks, huh? Okay, thanks for your support. Bye! And I'll send you a postcard from Turtle Camp. Aw, I hope you do, Sally. I really hope you do. Me, too. I hope I do it, too. Bye. Love you, Sally! Okay, thank-thank you. Today was a good day. Yeah. We got screwed, but Jimmy got screwed more. Yeah. I found some cucumber. Maybe we can make a cucumber-bund? Come on, Philip. It's time to prove yourself to the world. Let's make something Fronderful! Aah, we're out of peanut butter! Where are we gonna find something that can wrap around a human wrist? Hey. What if Tina and Tammy each threw away their bracelets? Then we could use them to hold up the lettuce. Great idea J-Ju! Thanks, Zeke! No way. My sparkle jelly stays on my wrist until I die, and then probably even after that. Tina can throw hers away. Why don't we throw Tammy away? (girls shrieking, grunting) Come on, girls! Work together for God's sake! Guys, we're gonna lose! We're supposed to be at the Cotton Candy Festival right now, and instead we're standing in a freaking Dumpster! They're just stupid sparkle jelly bracelets! They're not stupid! They're made of rubber, and they have a little charm on them, and they define who you are. Oh, my God, they are stupid. I don't need this sparkle jelly to dazzle. I dazzle on my own. We all do. Except for Tammy. How sure are we that this is peanut butter? 'Cause it's starting to burn. Sorry to interrupt. Go on with what you were saying. Tammy, these bracelets are what got us in here. Let's use them to get us out of here. I'm throwing mine away. Thanks, T. Tammy, now you throw away your bracelet. We need it to hold up the other arm. What do you say, Tammy? Let the fashion show begin!   (grunting) This is my design. It is a slim-fitted European-style suit. Apparently, Hildy the lunch lady cuts her hair in the parking lot, which I have used to make a fur lapel. (grunting) This is our fresh new design made of not-so-fresh lettuce. It's a tailored suit, perfect for a summertime wedding, or a summertime revolution. Mmm! Designers, I am impressed. Both teams did an excellent job making my trash suit. Mr. Frond, your outfit had class and sass. Kids, the tailored fit around the wrists of my lettuce suit was impeccable! We can easily change it to peccable if you prefer. But there was a clear winner. The kids! (cheering, excited chatter) What?! Mr. Branca, there must be some mistake. Wait. Did Tina and Tammy give up their bracelets to secure your sleeves? Did you... collaborate on fashion and build a bridge to friendship and understanding? We sure did, Mr. Frond. Let it go, Tammy! No! Never! Never! Never! I'll take your arm off with it if I have to! Maybe I did rehabilitate you kids after all. Yeah, maybe. Ah! I missed you, outside world! What year is it?! To the candy! It's made of cotton! Oh, my God. It's Principal Spoors. All the kids are gone. Oh, my God. Fire! Fire!  Don't you love cotton candy?  It's made of cotton and also candy  If your fingers get sticky  Eat off your hand, lickety-licky  Don't you love cotton candy?  Ah, don't, don't, don't, don't  Don't you love cotton candy?  Oh, yeah. 
(playing upbeat melody)   I want some burgers and fries  I want some burgers and fries  Well, there's some right here! Tina and Louise:  Don't you tell me no lies!  I can't tell if they're helping or hurting us out there, but I think hurting. Got me in here. You're here every day, Teddy. True, but today, it's 'cause of them. I think they sound good! It's better than this stupid hold music. Oh, hi, Dr. Rinaldi! No, no, I love your hold music. Listen, Doc, the rash is still there. I did everything you said... no shaving, no deodorant. Oh. Yeah. But now it's in both armpits. Eh. Mm-hmm. It's red and flaky... itchy, bumpy. (both groaning) Sometimes it's oozy. I look like Jeff Goldblum in The Fly. Lin, please stop describing your rash. I'm on the phone with the doctor, Bob! I know. Everyone knows. Shh! Sorry, folks. It's not... It's not a big deal. It's not... I mean, it doesn't get in the food. No, no, no, where are you going?  You want some burgers and fries!  Talking to you, buddy! Hey, thumbs up! Yeah! I got a thumbs up! That's better than a customer! Cool song, Gene. Yeah, you guys sound good. I'm diggin' it. You happen to be in the presence of child straw prodigies. We're pretty straw-some. That's awesome, but with straws? Strawsome? We borrow from a lot of genres. Maybe you guys can use a little wind? (playing lilting run of notes) Whoa! You just walk around with that thing? We were at orchestra practice. And, hey, why make it difficult when you can make it cymbal? Are we punnin', or are we jammin'? (playing upbeat tune) Oh! Oh! Ah! Ooh! (cheering) Guys, you know what this is, right? Tuesday? Oh, my God, it's trash day. No, we're a band. Finally, it's happening. Wait. We weren't a band before? Uh... before we had the "raz," but we needed the "matazz." So... what do you say? Yeah! Let's do it! Okay. All right, but I don't carry my own equipment. Yeah! That's the spirit! Okay, thanks, Doc. Boy, can that lady talk about rashes. What did she say? The rash'll probably go away on its own, but I got to wear a tank top to let it breathe. It's festering under there, I guess. Look at it. Can you see it? Lin, please! It's like my grandma used to say. Starve a fever, feed a cold and air out a festering rash in a tank top. (playing upbeat tune) Whoa, kids. Outside only with the loud noise, remember? Dad, this is the noise of a band. Aw, you guys are a band? That's fun. What's your band name? We're called The ltty Bitty Ditty Committee. 'Cause we have little ditties. Oh, now I get it. Gene: All right, everyone. This is the first official band practice, slash, band lunch for The ltty Bitty Ditty Committee. All: Yay! Oh, we were supposed to bring slash lunch? I didn't get the slash memo. Peter, I think you'll like the changes I made to your recorder. Oh. I electrified it. Give her a toot. (playing tune with distortion and reverb) Cool. Let's wail. (band plays tune)  Burger and fries, burger and fries  Uh, uh, uh, uh!  All right, so we got that song. Is it really a song, though, if you just say words over and over? Hmm. Good point. I guess most songs are sung. But here's the thing. When I sing, people don't seem to really, uh... how do I, uh, put it? Oh, yeah, enjoy it. Same with these two. It depends on your definition of "enjoy." I just prefer chanting. Can you guys sing? No. (raspy): Not if I want to live. If only we knew someone who could really sing. I think we do. Follow me.  Oh, oh, here she comes  Watch out boy, she'll chew you up  Oh, oh, here she comes  She's a maneater...  Of course, Darryl... the computer-nerd songbird. He's like a funky Bill Gates.  The woman is wild, oh...  Wow, he can sing. And he hardly even fainted.  Oh, oh, here she comes, she's a man...  Darryl! Aah! Don't do that! Darryl, ever think about being the lead singer of a band? Like, only every day. Great! You can be the lead singer of our band. You guys are a band? Why don't you see for yourself? (scat singing) So, yeah, we're a band. Guys, this is nice, but... Casio and straws at lunchtime? This is kind of kids' stuff. I'm just saying, if I'm gonna join a band, it's gonna be a real band, like Steely Dan. Darryl, honey, don't wait around for Steely Dan. He's not coming for you. He's not coming for any of us. It could happen. Just sing with us. If you, like, know a song that goes with these chords. Fine. One song, but nothing from Frozen, 'cause I don't want to cry. (playing upbeat song) (scat singing)  Girls, girls...  (scatting continues) Hey, Lenny Destefano. Are you hiding from one of your many girlfriends? Yup. Hey, you guys sound good. Are you a band? Yes! Um... You guys want to play my birthday party this Saturday? GENE, RUDY, PETER & DARRYL: Yes! Cool. (laughing): Not so fast, Lenny. We have to go over the particulars. What do you mean? We want the corner pieces of the cake, half of the piñata candy and ownership of the streaming and performance rights worldwide in perpetuity. I'm not having a piñata. Get a piñata. Okay. See you guys Saturday. Oh, my God! We just booked a gig at Lenny Destefano's birthday party! So, are you in the band, Darryl? Heck, yeah, I'm in the band! Yeah! The ltty Bitty Ditty Committee just got their first giggy! You guys, I blocked out my schedule every day after school for band practice. Every day? That's a lot of practice. We don't want to sound too rehearsed. Uh, yeah, Gene, we do. We want to sound really good. Lenny Destefano's party is a big gig. All right, fine, as long as practice includes snack breaks. And bathroom breaks and commercial breaks where I describe my favorite commercials. Hey, Tina. Hey, Jimmy Jr. I guess you heard the news about the ltty Bitty Ditty Committee. Huh? I was gonna tell you that you're standing in front of my locker. Oh. Sorry. What's the ltty Bitty Ditty Committee? Is that one of those improv groups? My cousin was kidnapped by one of them. That's our band name. We're playing Lenny Destefano's party on Saturday. It goes from 5:00 to question mark. Just kidding. It ends at 7:30. Two burgers of the day. I'm wearing this tank top 'cause the doctor prescribed it for me. Lin, you don't have to say that to every customer. What? I don't want people to think I'm trying to look like a hot potato. What's going on under there? It's just a little hair. I haven't been shaving my pits. See? Oh, my God. Wait. Wha...? It's just, there's so much of it. How long since you've stopped shaving? (groans) A few days. It grows in really fast. It's like animal fur. It looks like that guy's hair from Counting Crows. Yes! Okay, all right, everyone's having fun. Say good-bye to Mr. Jones. Aah. (band playing) Guys, I wrote a song for Lenny's party. Darryl, here are the lyrics. "His name is Lenny. "It is not Jenny. One time he ate a penny, and he thought nobody saw." Is that true? True enough. I changed the name of the guy who ate the penny from "Gene" to "Lenny," and it was a nickel. And two pennies and a tiny rock. All right, follow my lead. (playing upbeat tune)  His name is Lenny...  You know what? (clears throat) This key isn't working for me. Can we try it in D or E flat? No can do. Why not? 'Cause no know how to do. I can only play in this key. (plays notes) And I don't know which letter that is. (playing notes) Yeah, that's it. Here. Let me see. Uh... (scat singing, band playing)  His name is Lenny...  Are we playing in the right key? Oh, yeah.  One time he ate a penny and he thought nobody saw...  Whoa! Whoa! (laughs) Well, that was a mess! Let's not do that again! Ever. Right guys? (chuckles) Okay, all agreed. How was band practice, kids? Good. Fine. I thought it was kind of weird. Right, guys? Didn't you think it was weird? You mean when Darryl played your keyboard? And you stood there looking terrified? Yeah, that was weird. Darryl played your keyboard? Why? You know how when you only know how to play in one key, and the other people want to play in different keys, and you're, like, "What's a key?" Whoa! Mom, your armpit forests are really filling out. You can barely see your rash anymore, or your skin, or anything behind you. Dad, are you there? Yes, Tina, I'm right here... behind the armpit hair. Oh. Good. I love it! We finally have pets. I'm calling them "Laverne and Curly." Too late. I already named them "Harry and Sally." Wait. One's a boy? Obviously. It's not a boy. It's a man! No, it's not! I'd know if one was Billy Crystal. Everyone leave my pits alone! That one just got angry when you got angry. Enough! So, Linda's cooking today? Yeah, she, uh, thought she'd be more comfortable back there today. I'm hiding my pits. Lin, would it help if I took off my shirt in a show of solidarity? I got some weird stuff going on under here. No. Teddy, no. Maybe. Coming off. Hugo: Surprise! As in surprise inspection. Ugh. Hugo. Hi. Hi, Ron. I see you're busy as usual. Just do what you got to do, Hugo. Write me up for disorganized napkins or whatever. Oh, count on it, Bob. I will. But let's inspect the kitchen first. Hello, Hugo. Hi, Ron. Hi, Linda. Linda, something is unusual about you today. What is that? What? Nothing. It's nothing. Think fast! Ah! Aha! Aw. Linda here is in violation of Health Code Title 21, Section A, Paragraph eight. "Excessive body hair must be covered." But I need to wear a tank top. Need to? Why? Because of this rash... shida Jones. Uh, big fan. Oh, yeah. She likes tank tops, too. She does. She loves them. Uh-huh. Well, I happen to have some armpit hairnets with me. Ron? Here you go. Ugh! Are you kidding me? If you want to avoid a citation, you'll keep those on. Come on, Ron. Let's go down to the walk-in. Poke the produce, see what pokes back. Great. Now I look ridiculous. No. They look... good? Yeah, very, uh... Wow. It looks like I trapped two hedgehogs under my arms. It doesn't... that much. I love hedgehogs. I got to go! Lin, where are you going? Linda: I'm shaving 'em! Lin, wait. Teddy, I'll be right back. I got to go. Go to her, Bobby! Lin, don't do this. I'm doing it, Bob! I'm taking it all off! The doctor said if you shave, you're just gonna make it worse. I can't believe I'm saying this, but leave the hair alone. I hate this rash, Bobby! It's turning me into a monster! You're not a monster, Lin. Your armpits have monster qualities, but... Look, we're gonna fix this. How? First, you got to give me the razor. You're gonna do it? No. I wouldn't... go near that. Bob! We'd have to rent a hedge trimmer, or hire, like, a lumberjack or something like that. Stop it! Lin, listen, we're gonna go on the lnternet. Yeah? We're gonna type in "rash remedies." Uh-huh. And we're gonna see some horrible, horrible images. But we're also gonna get some help. I love you so much, Bobby! (band playing, Darryl scat singing) Hi. Wait. Did we have practice scheduled during lunch today? Hey... Gene. Uh, maybe, uh, you should sit down. Oh, good! I got here just in time for break, my favorite part of practice. Who's on whose lap? Gene, there's... there's a reason why we were practicing without you. Because you guys need twice as much practice as me? No... It's because we're making some changes, and, uh, you are, uh... We thought we should be in the band, and you shouldn't be in the band. Sorry. What?! I'm out of the band?! Well, good luck getting my sisters to play without me! Oh, yeah. They're out, too. Yeah. We're sort of evolving away from straws. The thing is, Gene, Rudy and Peter are trained musicians. And I kind of figured out how to sing all your keyboard parts. You can't sing my part and sing lyrics at the same time! Gene, he can. We've seen it and it's so good. Yeah, I brought in a looper pedal, so I can just...  Skoop bop boo boo  (recorded):  Skoop bop boo boo  Skoop bop boo boo, skoop bop boo boo...  I can sing on top of my voice  That's me, this is also me...    But this is my band! I started all of this! Yeah, and you're, like, the most fun member. Yeah. Yeah. I'm all drama. But the thing is you can't actually... play. You only know three chords! But I know them very well! Well, two of them I know very well! The other one I'm just getting acquainted with! This is hard for everyone, Gene. But mostly for me! Darryl and Rudy: Yeah. True. Fine! You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna get really, really good in time for Lenny's party! Lenny's party's in two days, Gene. I know that, Darryl! You guys are gonna be begging me to listen to you beg me to come back! The door's always open, Gene. Except can you close it on your way out? I will slam it! (grunts) (pneumatic hiss) Stupid safety door closing thing! Oh, kicked out of your own band. They David Lee Roth'd you. I'm glad we got kicked out. That was starting to cut into my not-going-to-band-practice time. And that time is precious. I'm okay with it. Now I can focus on my solo straw stuff. Like drinking liquids. Guys, we're gonna get back together. I'm just gonna become the greatest musician in the world in the next 48 hours and that'll be that. Easy. What are you gonna do, Gene? Go down to the crossroads, make a deal with the devil? Almost. I'm gonna ask Ms. Merkin to teach me. The music teacher at school? The Queen of the Keys? Yep! I figure one quick power sesh should get me ready for Lenny's party. Great plan, honey. I'm ready for the garlic, Bob. Not to be all Miss When ls Dinner but when is dinner? And what is dinner? You've been stirring that stuff forever. Oh, this isn't dinner. This is a home remedy for my armpit rash. We found it online. What?! It's well past dinnertime! (sighs) Sorry. It's just... feed your children. Okay, uh, Bob, hand me the oatmeal, the fish oil, and the buttermilk. No fair. Why do your armpits get to eat all the fun stuff? (sniffs) Oh, it smells really weird. Hmm. It's not that bad. (sniffs) I mean, it's a little weird. Okay, it's really weird. I'm just gonna try it. No! Tina! It's my medicine! Just give Tina whatever your armpits don't finish. I'm so hungry! Bob, order a pizza. Get one with oatmeal, fish oil, and buttermilk on it. Ms. Merkin: So you want to become a skilled musician. Yes. Well, good news, all it takes is practice... No... ...discipline... No. ...and hard work. No! Okay. Hearing a lot of no's. Look, I just want to get good enough to get back into my band, get discovered, make it big, throw it all away, get it back again, and we'll see what happens from there. Okay. Let's open up the workbook. Work book? Do you hear how you sound right now?! Gene, settle down. Listen to this. (playing scales) That's a terrible song. It's not a song. It's scales. Gross. It's not gross. It's gross. It's scales. It can't be gross. It's gross. It's not gross! It's scales! Well, I'm just sayin', it could use drums or somethin'. What? Nothing. (practicing scales) Again. Again?! We've been doing this for hours! You've been doing it for 45 seconds. Aah! I can't take it anymore! Gene, you don't become a skilled musician overnight. But that's exactly what I have to do! Lenny Destefano's birthday party is tomorrow! You're playing Lenny Destefano's birthday party? I was. Why don't you try and book next year or the year after that and practice until then? And see if you can get me on as your opening act, would ya? (sighs) Who am I kidding? I'm never gonna be a skilled musician. I think I'm just gonna go home. Would it help if I played you out? Maybe.  He's a-leavin' little early, but that's okay  He seems real depressed and a...  Okay, not helping!  What? Not helping! All right. It was a work in progress. There's my little Genethoven. How was your first music lesson? What'd you learn? I learned that I don't have what it takes. What are you talkin' about? You've got swagger, you got flare, you got panache. What else is there? I'm not getting back in my band or any band! I'm never gonna get to hear one of my songs used in a Hyundai Elantra commercial! Never! Aw, I'd give you a hug, hon, but I'd get stinky pit paste all over your head. Why do I never get that warning? (timer dings) Time to reapply. Ugh! Oh, God, you released the beast! Tina: It smells fine if you don't breathe. (straining): We got to move, Lin. It's gonna stink up the whole place. All right, we're goin' out to the alley to reapply. Tina, Louise, comfort your brother. (groans) There, there. I know what'll make you feel better. Here comes Ticklin' Tina. Tickle, tickle, tickle. I don't need to be a musician. In fact, I don't need music at all. Really? What? Stop looking at me like that, keyboard! You know I'm right! What would you do instead? Mmm. Maybe I'll be a baker. Or a candlestick maker.  Maybe I'll be a potter  Or a teacher like Welcome Back, Kotter  Maybe I'll juggle or maybe I'll juice  Be a Top g*n and be friends with Goose  One thing I know for sure  I don't need music  I don't need you anymore  I don't need music  I'm gonna kick you right out the door  I...  Don't  Need  Music  Anymore!  Aah! Why don't you take the hint and leave me alone?! Here! Take this thing and get rid of it for me! What are you saying? I never want to see or hear from it again. Burn it. (gasps) Gene, you don't want to do that. Take it! I have to report to the Miramar Naval Air Station in Miramar, California! Come on out, sweetie. You been in there all morning. Gene, come on, we gotta open up the restaurant. No, thank you! I'm fine! We missed you at breakfast. We missed all your funny banana jokes. That one where you pretend the banana is your pen1s. Eh, don't love that one. Why? It's a little easy. Why? What do you mean, "easy"? He's got other ones. Like what? Which ones? He does the banana mustache, he does Captain Banana... Oh, yeah. Ooh! I know what'll get him out. Who wants to see Mommy's big hairy pasty pits? Gene: Nah. Good idea, Lin. Louise: All right, all right. Nice try from the B-team. You guys go ahead downstairs. The A-team will take it from here. Gene, we're coming in. B-team? All right. We're leaving but only because we have to open the restaurant. And we're not the B team. No, like in a good way. (whispers): Not in a good way. So, you're, uh, still done with music, right? Yes. You haven't changed your mind? Nope. This is what I'm doing now. Okay. Cool. Oh! I almost forgot. What is this? That's your keyboard. We burnt it. Just like you asked. (gasps) TINA: That's what you wanted, right? Yes. (groans) (rock 'n' roll beat begins)  Keyboard, my keyboard  Keyboard, my keyboard...  Keyboard! I don't want you to be dead! Aha! We knew it! We knew you still cared! And that's why we didn't burn your keyboard. What? This isn't my keyboard? No. We burnt Dad's new socks. Who does he think he is? (wails) If you want to see your real keyboard, put on your burger suit, do something about that hair, and come with us. Come on, Gene, let's play together, like we used to. You play the keyboard and we'll play the cups. Like old times. No. I can't. I'm not a real musician. Well, you're definitely a real something. Maybe "musician" just isn't the right word for you. Maybe you're a... musishy. Come on, Gene. Just one song. Yeah. And after that, if you're still done with music, we'll really burn this sucker. Uh... Mmm... uh... Come on. (grunting) There we go. (fart sound) This is going well. Mmm... (playing notes) Mmm... Hmm. Mmm, mmm, mmm. There you go. Mmm. (straw squeaking) (straws squeaking, rhythm track playing) Look! They got Gene to play! Wow. They really are the A-team.  You want some burgers and fries  Do you want some burgers and fries?  Well, there's some right here  LOUISE/TINA:  Don't you tell me no lies  Yeah! Burger Boy! Give 'em some straw! (straws squeaking rapidly and rhythmically) Speedo Man: Oh, yeah. Aw. (grunting) Yeah. Ooh! Wow! Spin! Hey, you guys want to amp things up? (chuckles) Plug it up! Plug it in! What does that mean? Plug in the amp! Oh, right! Okay. Oh, look! The kids have a little flash mob out there! This thing's turning into a dance party! I'm goin' out there. Dog bark solo! (barking sound effects) (grunting) Lin, I think the pit paste worked. I can't see your rash anymore. Oh, yeah! The rash is gone! You can shave. Yeah... What? You don't want to shave? I don't know. I kind of like 'em now. My little Harry and Sally. Ugh. I mean, great. Armpit hair! Cool! Madonna... Thank you! (grunting) Yeah! What are you guys doing here? Isn't it almost time for Lenny's party? Well, funny story. Um, after you were invited to leave the band, and you reluctantly accepted, we, um... It's not fun anymore! So you're saying you're sorry? Yeah. Want to get the band back together and go play Lenny's party? All right. Hey! Who wants to go to a cool sixth grader's party? (cheering) LOUISE: Yay! Let's lead everybody away from the restaurant! Bob: No, no, no, no! No, no! Louise: Yes, yes, yes, yes! Tina: I hope Lenny's okay with this. What am I saying? He's Lenny Destefano. You guys are gonna love him!  I want some burgers and fries  I want some burgers and fries  Well, there's some right here  Both:  Don't you tell me no lies  I want some burgers and fries  I want some burgers and fries  Well, there's some right here  Both:  Don't you tell me no lies  (playing keyboard)  I want some burgers and fries, ooh...  I want...  Well, there's some right here  Louise and Tina:  Don't you tell me no lies  I want some burgers and fries, ooh...  Well, there's some right here!   Don't you tell me no lies! 
(yawns) My birthday. Boy... (coughs) Ah. Oh. I can't even say it to myself. Forty-f... (groans) Forty-f... Oh. Maybe I'll sleep through this one. (sleepy murmuring) Mom! Are you up yet? We may or may not have a surprise for you. We're coming in! Put your boobs away. Excuse me, young lady, we're looking for our mother, to serve her breakfast in bed on her birthday. Yeah, we don't mean to bother you. You're obviously in the middle of a photo sh**t, 'cause you're a youthful supermodel. Guys, this is Mom. What?! Oh! Happy birthday, Mom! Happy toast, eggs and orange juice, pretty mom! Thank you, kids. It's lovely. The best part of my birthday is my babies bringing me breakfast in bed every year. Ah-ah-ah, not so fast. There might be more this year. Oh. Okay, "add a drop of witch hazel to the egg whites for even tighter, smoother skin." Don't have witch hazel, but how about vinegar? Same thing. Maybe. Linda is gonna love this. (high-pitched voice): "You're right, Bob. You're the best husband." Thank you, vinegar. I'm glad witch hazel's not here. Oh. Oh, the toast is a little burnt. Yep, just the way you like it. Oh, and hard. Burnt and hard. Every year I say, "Why does she like it this way?" But then I say, "Hey, make it the way she likes it." Bob: Kids, I could use a little help in here. But we like to watch her graze, Dad. Go on, I'm good. Maybe bring me some new toast! Stir until frothy. That's subjective. Kids, does this look frothy to you? Mm... I've seen frothier. What is that, egg whites? Mostly. And vinegar. Gene, would you slice up that cucumber? On it. And, Tina, can you do this? A mayonnaise hair treatment? Mom's hair is gonna shine like a beautiful sandwich. Why is home spa day so delicious? Oh, Louise, and can you just clean up this mess? What?! You're the youngest. I'm also the worst at cleanup. Look. Gene, after you're done with the cucumbers, clean up. No. Tina, after you do the hair treatment, can you clean up? Okay. Can I come out now? Bob: Not yet, Lin! What? How about now? Almost! Now? Not really close at all, sorry. Oh... Well, did you happen to get milk yesterday? Huh? No, I forgot. I was preoccupied with something (singsongy): That I think you're gonna like! (singsongy): That's nice, but somebody has to do the shopping! (singsongy): I'll do it this afternoon! Okay, I'm getting a little cabin fever in here. What if I go to the store and do our shopping while you guys do whatever you're doing that I don't know about? Stay in there! Don't make us chain you up! Actually, that could work out perfectly. We could use the extra time. What? I'm gonna blindfold her. Double-bag the head. Ow. Doing good. Ow. Little to the left. Ow! Louise! I-I said to your left. Ow. Ow. And we're here. Ugh. Why'd I have to be blindfolded? 'Cause you're a sneaky peeky. Hey, take your time, Lin. Uh, treat yourself. Go to the good store. You mean the one that's further away? Yeah! The good store? Get the premium fudge pops! Don't you come home without them! Yeah, for your birthday. Right, happy birthday! See you when you get back! Bye. Tina: Oh, and can you get more mayonnaise? We're out and I need it today. But not for a surprise. Just, um, 'cause I need it. Okay, Tina. Thank you. Good-bye. It was nice, Ginger. It was nice, as always. But then they wanted me to stay in my room forever while they set something else up. I was going crazy in there! Meanwhile, no one did the shopping, so that's what I'm doing. Ugh, chalk festival. What's next, a crayon convention? A pencil parade? Right? Anyway, I know my family means well, but I wish I could just tell them I hate my birthday. You get to a certain age and they're no fun. In my 20s, I had va va voom, now I just have va va (blows raspberry). And it feels like breakfast in bed is just practice now for when they put me in a home, right? (chuckles) Well, anyway, thanks for letting me vent, Ginger. Sorry for the long voice mail. Call me when you can. Love you, kid. Bye. (sighs) This is taking forever. I can help whoever's next on check stand three! Oh, great. Thank you. Uh, hey, excuse me! He said whoever's next. That's me. I'm next in line. You were behind me, 'member? You were just over there... Oh, it's okay. I only have a few things. This and that and this other thing. A few things? She's got a cart full of juice. Deirdre! How's it going? Hi! Oh, my God, they know each other. Is all of this for "Chalk of the Town"? Yeah, we're hoping for a bigger turnout this year. Ugh, that stupid chalk festival. I'm not sure about these cups though. Mm, good instinct. Since you brought it up, these are not the good cups. What? Tell me everything. They leak. I don't know why I even sell them. We have better cups for the same price. The ones on the bottom shelf, ironically. Well, clearly I got to have those cups. Go get them. I'll wait for you. (chuckles): Oh, thanks. I'm here till 3:00, I don't care. Unbelievable. Oh, and you might want to grab some more ice, too. It's a hot one. Deirdre: Good idea! She'll just be a second. You don't mind, right? (growls) Great, thanks. So, you're not done yet. Let's take a look at this receipt, see how much you saved today. Oh, gosh, yes. Oh, my God, please! Just end this! We're not getting any younger over here! Well, don't blame us for that. (gasps) (both laughing) Anyway, thanks again for the tip on the cups. Hey, no problem. Let me know how they work out. Nice, uh, chalking with you. (laughs): Oh-ho-ho, you! Finally! You sure you guys are done? Hold on. I have to put these old cups back. (groans) Stupid birthday. I hate cups. Nuts! Old flower petals from Mort's? Check. That's great, Tina. We'll spread them from the front door into the bathroom to the tub. Huh. Hmm. Huh. Yeah. Bob: That's, like, six... six petals. Yeah, not a lot of funerals this month. Mort said to check back around the holidays. Maybe just one in the hallway, one in the doorway, and then one at the tub? Yeah. Well, we could get some branches. Yeah, I don't... I'm not sure that will have the same impact. Hmm. Okay, well, just float those in the tub. That'll still be nice. And here's my New Age relaxation CD. A lady having a garage sale forced me to take it. (whale song playing) That's pretty relaxing, I guess. Is... is that whales? I think it's... the saddest whale. This isn't that bad, you guys. I think we may have actually pulled this together. I mean, I know your mom, and she's really gonna like this. This could end up being a pretty decent birthday. Pretty decent birthday? More like best birthday! Best birthday? Best day of her life! (grunts) Oh, mm... Oh, come on! (grunting) Aw, gum? Ew! (groans) (grunting) (grunts) Damn it! Wha... oh! No, no, no, no, no, no! I hate my birthday! Hi. Me again. (chuckles) Uh, I locked my keys in my car and I was wondering if I could use your phone to call my husband. Mm, I'm sorry. Our phone is for employees only. It's an emergency! Locking your keys in your car is not an emergency. What? You can't check into a hospital with a bad case of "you locked your keys in your car." You know what? Fine. I'll ask to borrow someone's cell phone. No harassing our customers. Did you know your pants are ripped? Yes! Uh, excuse me, sir, can I borrow your cell phone? I locked my keys in my car, and I got to call my husband. Uh, I don't, uh, have a cell phone. You don't? (ringtone playing) What's that right there? What's that? (stuttering): I don't know. I got to go. Wait, wait, wait, wait, come back! I'm a good person! (ringing) Hmm. Your mom's not picking up her phone. Um, let me try Aunt Gayle. Hi, Gayle, it's Bob. Uh, have you heard from Linda today? Yes, I know it's her birthday, Gayle. I just don't know where she is. (Gayle shrieking) Yeah... calm down, Gayle. I-I'm sure she's fine. Gayle, pull yourself... Gayle. Gayle! Gayle! Oh, my God, there she is. Hi, Linda. Uh, Gayle, she just walked in. She's fine, she looks great. Call you back later. Bye. You know Mom's not really here, right? Yes, Tina. Because you said she was... you saw her. I know, but I was... Forget it. Were you lying? All right. Yes. Listen, your mom probably just ran out of gas or something. I'll call Teddy and see if he can drive us out to the store. Wow. Going to the store with Teddy? Happy birthday to us. Hi. Hi. I know I look a little crazy, but I'm having a rough day. Uh-huh. It's my birthday... Happy birthday! ...and I locked my keys and my cell phone in my car at the grocery store. Oh! The worst. Yeah. And I'm just trying to get home. Does this bus go to the wharf? You're in luck, yes! Oh! Please take me. I swear I will pay you the fare once I get it from my apartment. Please. Okay. Come on up. Oh! Oh, thank God. Thank you! Ha. Finally, something's going right. (chuckles) You won't regret this. Wait, wait, wait, where you going? The wharf is the other way! This is the express to Wildwood Wharf. What wharf did you think? Wonder Wharf! The one I was pointing at! (stammers) I just thought you were a bad pointer. (sighs) Pull over so I can get off. I can't pull over; We're on the highway. You'll have to wait until we get to our next stop. Oh, my God. Uh, well, I guess I'll just get on the next bus going the other way, right? That'd be me on my way back. Oh! Shouldn't be more than an hour and a half. Might as well just stay on. Hey, we can play the alphabet game! An hour and a half? Oh. I'll just walk back. Fine, we'll play till the next stop. (groans) There's an "A" on that sign. (groans) I'm winning. There's a "B." (groans) You're falling behind! I got two! (driver laughs, Linda groans)   Bus Driver: It's gonna be fun. Ugh, those poor fudge pops. They don't stand a chance. They'll refreeze though, right? Right?! Sure they will, but they'll be in weird shapes. Ugh, super weird. Yeah. Where are you, Mom?! Okay, she's not in the store, but she definitely was. The checker did not like her. That was clear. How could you tell? It was clear. What do you mean? He said so. He hated her. He said he hate... "I hated..." "...your wife." Huh. But he did say he thinks she took off walking. And we didn't see her on the drive here, so she must have walked in a different way? We'll never find her! There are dozens of ways to walk home! And dozens of women walking! How will we know which one is her? I'm already forgetting what she looks like. She's a woman. I think she's... tall. Does she have glasses? I can't remember. Yes! Yes, she does. All right, let's focus, okay? She has a hook for a hand! I'm sure of it! Gene, no. Okay, so if I'm gonna walk it, I could cut through that way? You're pointing at me. Where did you learn to point? No, I'm pointing through you. But it's at me. The other side of the... Oh, behind me? Well, that makes a lot more sense. Yeah, no, that's where you want to walk. Okay, thanks, Andrew. Bye, Linda. Bye. Okay, bye, Linda. Happy birthday. Beep-beep. That's me; The horn doesn't work. Bye. Well, this is the only other street your mom could've taken. Where is she? We got to find her. Every minute we're not with her, she's having a worse and worse birthday. She must have stopped somewhere, but where would she go? Is Chaka Khan in town? Nope, she doesn't come through till December. Mom probably got hungry. She needs to eat every 15 minutes or she becomes a monster. But she doesn't have any money. She locked her purse in the car. Oh, Devendorf's Bakery. They're really generous with their samples. Mom and I go there a lot. You do? Well, it's actually been a while. We're both worried about bathing suit season. I guess it's worth a try. To Devendorf's Bakery! To free samples! (bird cawing) Ugh, mud. (groans) Okay, Linda. Try to look on the bright side. How often do you get to walk through a field? It's kind of neat. Look around. It's a nice day. Oh, here's a pretty flower. Oh! Oh, God, uh-oh, it's skunk. Oh, he's sleeping. Just gonna tiptoe away and not bother you. Oh, God! Oh, my face! (muttering) (groaning) Oh, God, that stupid skunk! Nocturnal idiot! Whoa! (cracking) Oh, for the love of Pete! (chuckles) I can still see out of one side. Sort of. What's that black fuzzy thing? (screams) Oh, you little skunk! Bob: So this is where you go with your mom, huh? Yeah, now let me do the talking. You just look cute. Hey, you, long time no see. How's the pumpernickel today? Dry? Better try a sample. Hello, uh, I'm looking for my wife. She's got black hair and red glasses. And amazing wrists, but huge hands. Teddy. What? I'm just trying to be specific. You mean her? Yes. Wait, why do you have a photo of... Wait, what does that say on the picture? It says "Do not feed." What? Do not feed. Your wife was abusing our free sample policy. She hasn't been in here since we posted the photo. She's been coming here without me? What did that guy do? He wants his crusts cut off. What did she do? She touches everything. Everything. What did he do? He's really r*c1st. What did that baby do? He's just a jerk. Okay, fine. Thank you. Uh, we're leaving. Kids, let's go. You know, maybe don't give out free samples and then get mad at people when they eat them. Well, you know, unfortunately, we can't bake enough in a day to fill your wife's giant hands. There's only so much pumpernickel in the world. What did you say? Oh-ho, you poor dumb baker. Here comes the thunder. Guess what? No one talks about... Hey. My wife's giant hands... Easy. On her birthday! Except for Teddy, because... All right... he also... complimented... her wrists! And this pumpernickel is dry! And a little dirty. Please give me a ride! I locked my keys in my car... Oh, God, go, go! And I got on the wrong bus and it's my birthday! All right, let's all think. Where else could your mom have possibly gone between the grocery store and home? Okay, okay, I'm Mom. I'm walking around, I'm singing. (gasps) She stopped to poop! Of course! Why didn't I think of that? We should check the bathroom in the lobby of the Royal Oyster Hotel. Why that one? It's Mom's favorite. What? So that's what Mom means when she says she's going to shuck an oyster. Oh, my God. I want to see this bathroom. I could go. (sighs) Let's go to the Royal Oyster Hotel. Gene: Should we call ahead to let them know we'll all be pooping? (horse whinnies) Oh, like you guys smell so good. Uh, turns out it was just number one. Thank you, Teddy. Not for me. I hit a grand slam. Really good job, Gene. Thank you. No Mom. But they did get a new potpourri. Mom's gonna love it. Excuse me, are you guests of the hotel? No, uh, we're, uh, we're... we're just looking for my wife. She sometimes comes here to... use the... restroom. Oh, Linda? You must be Bob! Yes. Wait, y-you know her? Well, as much as you can know a woman who comes to your hotel once or twice a week to poop. Hey, isn't it her birthday today? Uh, yes. Hey, Tim. Have you seen Linda today? Oh, please, it's barely noon.  She does her B.M. in the p.m.  Hi, Tim.  Hey, Tina  How you doing, girl?  Huh, well, she's not here, so we better go. What? No, stay a little. We finally get to meet you after all these years. Years? Where does the time go? We-we really got to find my wife. Nice meeting you though. Bye. Bye. Say hi to Linda for me. Tell her we got new potpourri. She was absolutely right. Uh, will do. (panting): Just four more blocks. Oh, God, this thing? Welcome to Chalk of the Town. Oh, God, it's you. Oh, you and your dumb cups. What happened? (sniffs) Oh, you smell. It's been a rough morning, Deirdre. What is that, some sort of street diaper? You're a street diaper. No, you're the street diaper. No, you! Okay, you're the one actually wearing a street diaper, so if anyone is a street diaper, it's you. Step aside, street diaper. I'm going through. Oh, not without a ticket, I'm afraid. Well, I'm afraid it's a public street, so get out of my way. You should have been nicer at the grocery store and maybe I would. Uh-oh! Your cups are spilling! What are you do... Oh, my God. I guess these weren't the good ones after all. Oh, don't! Stop! No! My chalksterpiece! Do not move. Just carefully step off. What is this? It's the story of America, and you're scuffing it up, you hag! (gasps) Hag?! Yep. You know what I think? I think I'm gonna do a little twist. No. No. A little twist and shout. No! Don't you do it. A twist a twisty shout. How-how about the Charleston? (grunting) (humming) (screams) I'm gonna Charleston on your face! (screams) (screaming) Come back here! I'm gonna get you! Help! She's crazy! Get back here! She's destroying the art! No, I'm not! You're the one stepping all over everything! Sorry, sorry! Ooh, good manhole! Ooh, space! Hi, aliens! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! (laughs, whoops) Damn it! Wow. People are very divided on your mom. Where is she? Does this town have cults? Maybe she joined one of those. I might know a place where she could be. Where? She's probably not there. I shouldn't have said anything. Let's definitely not go. (barking) Well, she's not here. Let's call it. Wait, Louise, you and your mom come here? Used to come. To pet the puppies? No. (scoffs) I guess. I don't know; I've never even come inside the store. I'm always outside just pitching pennies, breaking bottles, you know, being a hoodlum. Hey, Louise, I thought that was you. Oh, hi, Robert. Want me to get out Colonel Fluffles again? He missed you. Hi, Louise, how you doing? Oh, God, don't make eye contact. He's reeling me in. (giggles) Colonel Fluffles! You're so...  Someone comes to the pet store with Mom.  I'm beginning to think my secret bathroom trips with Mom aren't as fun as what you guys do. Uh, he's getting old. I'm just a puppy. Well, he's got cloudy eyes this time. Yeah, I know, his eyes are a little... But I'm fine. Don't worry about me. I'm a scrapper. Oh, he looks lumpier than last time. I'm a little bit lumpy, but that's just more to love. Yes, that is. Want to say hi to Uncle Feathers? All right! Did it just say "all right"? All right! Wow. Your mom leads a rich, kind of odd life that I did not know about. Bobby, does this parrot make me look cool? Oh, crap. I just realized, if Linda gets home, she can't get in. She doesn't have her keys. One of us should have stayed behind. Not it. Gene, it's too late. N-Never mind. Let's go. Ha! Ha! Ha-ha! I did it! I actually made it home. Bob! Kids! Let me in! Mommy's home! It's the birthday girl! (groans) Where are they? (grunting) Aah! Ooh. Aah! Not gonna let this birthday win. (grunting continues) Yes! I win! Son of a b1tch. Ha! Ha-ha! Whoa! (screaming) Kids: Mom? Lin? (softly): Happy Spa Day. That's me. You sure it was only one skunk, Mom? No, it was two, or it was the same guy twice. Mom, is it cool if I dip my grilled cheese in your tomato bath? Yeah, go ahead. Yeah! So, wait, what color were the horses again? Just plain brown, I guess. (whispers): Yes. Lin, I got to tell you, I learned some new things about you today. Stuff I didn't know. Stuff I respect, kind of, and I'm glad to say, after all these years, I'm still finding little surprises. Also, I wrote all of that in your birthday card. See? Oh, yeah. Aw. Yep, I did that. But sorry your birthday was horrible, Lin. Hey, don't be sorry. This was the best birthday ever. What? Yeah. I kicked this day's butt. I still got it. I think I might even be getting better. I want this to be the new tradition. Every year on my birthday, you blindfold me and you drop me off somewhere with no cell phone and no money, and I have to make my way home. Deal! Now let's Bloody Mary up this tub! It's Mommy's birthday! Gene, grab the vodka! (whoops) All right. On it!  B.M. in the p.m.  She does a B.M. in the p.m.  Not number one, number two  It's a potpourri for you and me, yeah  She does a B.M. in the p.m.  You gotta  When she gotta go, yeah  B.M. in the p.m.  She gotta go, yeah, when she gotta go, yeah  B.M. in the p.m.  She gotta go, yeah  'Cause when she gotta go, she gotta go  She does a B.M. 
Here you go, Teddy. Thanks for the rush order. I got a hell of a busy day ahead of me. Teddy, why did you ask for a to-go bag if you're gonna eat it here? I'm leaving, I'm leaving. Are you, though? Kids. It's good that you're so busy, Teddy. Yeah, I got a dry wall job in town, plus, I've been taking care of a summer house out on Craggy Neck. It's supposed to rain today, so I gotta put the lawn furniture under the deck. Sorry we asked. (phone rings) Hello? Oh, hi, Mr. Handley. Your hot water heater? Yeah, I could be there today. All right... I'll see you soon. And now I just took another job. Why would I do that?! Teddy! (growls) All right, calm down, Teddy. Hey, I'll go out to Craggy Neck for you. What? Really? Yeah, I want to go to a nice place and drag furniture under a deck. Take us! I could drag some furniture. Well, that'd be a big help. All right! Wait, if you're algoing to some beach house, then I should go, too. We could close for a little while. But, Dad, what if people want to come to the restaurant? Oh, right. That's true. I p... (chuckles) Just kidding, Dad. Just kidding. Oh. Bob: All right, we're here. Louise: All right! Tina and Gene: Yay! Oh. We're on the frickin' beach. Bob: That is quite a view. I mean, I know it's the same ocean near our house, but this one's better. I mean, it's on the beach. They probably have crabs bringing them the newspaper. That is the life. Oh, and it's so beautifully landscaped. (gasps) Look at those boulders! Bob: Gene, get off the boulders. They love it! (straining): I got it. On my own. Because I'm strong. Good job, Dad! Oh, so pretty inside. (gasps) Oh. The door's open. Should we go inside? Just to close the door? Well, I guess so. I mean, how else are we gonna close the door? Oh. We're inside. We're in the house. How did that happen? Bob: What are you doing? Both: Aah! You're trespassing. You're in somebody's home. Well, technically it's somebody's summer home. That's different, right? Yeah. Totally legal. We're just shutting the door. Ooh, are we breaking and entering? As a family. So it's okay. Come stand next to me for two seconds. It'll feel like we're on vacation. No, Lin, we should go. Wow, this is nice. I feel really poor right now. Yeah. I guess we can stand here for another two seconds. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And then we'll leave. Okay. But we're not touching anything. Yeah. Sure. Of course not. Huh. I think I like boats now. Aw, these must be the owners. Cute couple. Little age difference but that's okay. Oh, and they travel. Must be nice. Pushing up the Leaning Tower. Couple of hams. Do you think we should get a boat? And a subscription to a boat magazine? Look at that ring! Looks like a disco ball. She's got Studio 54 on her hand. I think I'm gonna get one. I think I'm gonna get a boat; A big boat. Wait, what are we doing? We-we got to go. Kids, we're leaving! Kids, we gotta go... oh, my God. Game room. Oh, hey, Dad. Welcome to Funtown. Oh, I forgot to get a big house so we could get a pool table. We do have to go, but first, I should probably teach you kids how to play pool. We know how to play. You just roll the balls and hear them click. So far I'm winning. (grunts) Yes. All right, kids, there are a couple things in life I'm really good at, and pool is one of them. What are the other things? And don't say burgers. Prepare for the thunder that is my break. Tina, step to the side. I don't want the shockwave to hit you. (grunts) Whoa. (groans) That was terrible. Yeah, I thought maybe it was, but I wasn't sure, so I just said "whoa." It's probably the cue. Oh, yeah. This one is... crazy warped. It looks straight to me. Yeah, you can't use a cue stick like this. No... Okay. This one feels not warped. Corner pocket, your mouth is open, I hope you're hungry! Damn it! Whoa... Is that... is that good? (thunder rumbling) Ooh, they're skiers. So sporty, those two. Look like Hart to Hart. Do you know who gave me this water? The refrigerator did! What? Came right out of the door! Goodness. What are you up to? I'm just curious who these people are. You know, what books they read, what kind of music they like. Got it. You're snooping. What?! I'm not snooping... I'm just noticing. Sure. Ooh, they climbed a mountain. Good for them. Should we go "notice" around in that room? Ooh. Home office. Look, they get mail. That's fun. Ooh, and we got a name! Larry Goodwin. Why do they have so many clocks? How much time do you need? Spooky. They all stopped at 3:13. Oh, wait, they all moved. I think I figured it out. Look at this: They all say Goodwin. Larry Goodwin! Larry's rollin' in clock money! So that's how you afford a beach house. We've been going about it all wrong. Did you see that drawer open all by itself? It just popped open. It did, didn't it? Yeah, look at that. Just popped right open. Well, that's weird. Aw, their wedding picture. Wait, that woman looks different than the one in all the other pictures. Huh. She does. She had a totally different forehead. Must've got it reduced. Mom, this is a different wife. This must be the first wife! (gasps) (thunder crashes) And Larry traded her in for a newer, prettier model. That b*st*rd! You think you know somebody! Larry! (front door opening) Oh, crap. Oh, crap. Someone's here. Are you just saying that because I'm beating you? Shh! Hide. Bob? Linda? You guys in here? Bob: Yeah? Why? Right. Why. Yeah. Why are you inside the house? Right. Teddy. Good question. Right, Bob. What are you doing in the house? Uh... Linda? Jump in any time. (chuckles) Wait a minute, this isn't under the deck. Bobby, why'd you make us come in here, you silly? Thanks, Lin, that was great. Sorry, Teddy. We shouldn't have come in. Poking around, huh? Trying the hall on for size? I get it. You take a bath? What? No. Your loss. Teddy, why are you here? We came all this way so you wouldn't have to. The weather's getting real stormy. I thought I ought to make sure the house is all sealed up. Yeah, I'm sure Larry Goodwin would appreciate it. Much more than he appreciated his first wife, who dared to age. Huh? Keep up, Dad. Right on, Mom. I wouldn't know anything about Larry. I never met him. He died before I started working here. (gasps) Larry's dead? Larry's dead! Yeah. Terrible accident. He slipped on the widow's walk up on the roof and fell onto the decorative boulders below. I thought those boulders seemed traumatized. Helen, the wife, she's a doll. Nicest woman in the world. Poor thing witnessed the fall from the rose garden. Oh, my... oh, my God. What if Little Miss Second Wife didn't witness the d*ath? What if she did the d*ath?! (gasping) Of course! What? Helen k*lled her husband for his clock fortune! She's a black widow! We are in the tastefully decorated house of a k*ller. Huh. It is tastefully decorated. It's all right. Teddy: Come on! Helen's not a m*rder*r. Whoa, Lin, That's a pretty big accusation. Ye, well, m*rder's a pretty big crime. All right. Time to go. Whoa, whoa, whoa, Dad. We're not leaving until we find evidence we can take to the fuzz. This is a hot cold case. Yeah, we owe it to Larry and his clock family. You two cannot be serious. Look at her shifty snake eyes. Yeah, if you take away her warm smile, she's got the ice-cold stare of an ice-cold m*rder*r. Tina: And if you take away her nose, she looks really weird. Gene: Yeah, and if you take away half of her face, she's like... half face. Guys, come on. This is Helen we're talking about. She was in the rose garden when Larry slipped and fell. Oh, you mean Larry, the mountain climber, 'Cause he didn't slip! Helen pushed him off the widow's walk! She pushed him! No, no, no, no. You're really stretching, guys. Teddy, what else can you tell us about Larry's "accident"? Eh, it was a freak thing. The guy leaned against the railing and it gave way. The cops said it was loose. I bet she loosened the railing. With what? Magic? What could possibly remove a nail from wood? The back of a hammer. The-the thingies. Teddy, where does she keep her tools? She doesn't have any tools. She's not very handy. Also... Eh, forget it. What, Teddy? What? Well, I think she might be hiring me because she's lonely. She's definitely not a k*ller. She's really the sweetest little thing. She's not little, she's regular-sized. Aw, just talking about her gets me all frazzled. Teddy, do you have a crush on Helen? What? Huh? No. Aw! Does she have a crush on you? Does she drop things in front of you so you both have to bend down and pick them up? Sometimes we have tea on the deck and just talk for what feels like minutes. Linda, can we have a word in private? No. Yes. What, Bob? I'm onto something here. You're not. I am. The only thing you're doing is messing up a possible relationship for Teddy. This Helen lady sounds like she's nice and lonely, and Teddy is probably a good match for someone nice and lonely. Or anyone. Teddy should date anyone that likes him, basically. Anyone except someone who's gonna m*rder him. But maybe even that's okay. For Teddy. (gasps) Oh my God, I just thought of something. Teddy, so Larry landed on the decorative boulders in the backyard? That's right. Look at this photo. Notice anything? Tina: Even at his age, Larry could still pull off cargo shorts? Mm-hmm. (gasps) There are no boulders! Exactly! 'Cause Helen put 'em there when she came on to the scene. And then she pushed Larry right onto 'em, ensuring his d*ath. You guys are really jumping to conclusions here. You mean pushing to conclusions, Dad? Teddy, how do you get up to the widow's walk? We're gonna reenact a little m*rder. (wind blowing) TEDDY: Storm's really whipping up out there! I can't hear you! The storm's really whipping up! Linda! You're not going out there. It's too dangerous! It's fine, it's fine! Whoa! (grunting) Never mind, never mind. Let's do it inside. (quietly): Mom's hair looks terrible. I know. I can't look at her. But you can't look away. I'm just looking kind of to the side. Okay, so here's what I think happened. Bob, you're Larry. No. Sweet, dead Larry. Ugh, God. I'm Helen. I'm a bad person, and I want your money so onto the boulders with you! (grunts) Ow! (Linda whoops) Ow, my back. Did you actually have to push me? I think that's exactly how it happened, Mom. Uh-huh. Nah, nah. There's no way Helen's a k*ller. Seriously, I think my back is... (moans) bad. All right, all right, you baby. Let's help you onto the couch. (quietly): Dad's hair looks horrible. It always looks horrible. There we go. We never should have come into this house. (screaming) It's all right, everybody. It's probably just a brownout. I'm not, like, too scared. (screaming) Helen! Hey. You're here. (gasps) It's her. (quietly): Her hair looks amazing. Let's ask her where she goes. So, Helen, uh, I thought you were in New York. I decided to get away for a few days to my vacation home. And who are these people in my vacation home? Right. These are my friends. They're a family. They're Belchers. Sorry, you see, I asked them to... You take your dirty children and get the hell out! (gasps) Oh, God. Helen, I'm sorry. I... (chuckling): I'm kidding! (laughing nervously) What a fun, terrifying joke. Isn't she a hoot? Oh, I'm glad you're here. I've been driving for hours in that storm. Surprised the roads are open. Welcome! I'm Helen. Hi, I'm Bob. These are my kids, Tina, Gene, and Louise. And this is my wife Linda. Nice to meet ya, Helen. You're making a lot of eye contact, little girl. That's a k*ller handshake you've got there. Thank you. I'm, uh... I'm really squeezing. Anyways, we should get home before the roads get any worse. Come on, kids. What?! Mom, I thought you wanted to solve the crime! Safety first! I have to protect my babies! Helen, what car snacks do you have? Oh, I need to not stand up. Are you okay? Nah, he's fine. He's faking it. Come on. I'm not faking. My wife pushed me. Yeah, pushed by a lady. You know how that is, Helen. Bob: Louise. You know, I have some pain relievers from back when I used to take a lot of pain relievers. Would you like some? Yes, please. No, he doesn't. No, no, no. Uh, yes, I would. Thank you. Great. I'll be right back. See? She's nice. Do you think she likes me? I'm not really a fair judge since she wasn't too helpful with the car snacks. Bob, we got to get out of here! She's a k*ller! Linda, I can't go anywhere because someone pushed me. Mom, we got to stay and see this through! This case could make our careers! There is a 90% chance she kills us in the next hour! She's a nice lady whose husband fell off a roof. You've got to stop. Does anyone have any cologne? Gene? No. I'm not allowed to wear cologne again until I prove I can be responsible with it. I have a cough drop in my pocket. Give it. (jabbering) All I know is that woman is a mur... ...maid. Mermaid! And that's the history of mermaids. Oh, thanks, Mom! Such amazing creatures. Hey, Helen. (laughs) Hi. And here you go. Oh! Boop! Uh, boopsie. Oh! What happened there? Crazy arms. Good thing there's more where that came from. Here you go. Ha! (mumbling) Bobby! (grunting) Wow, What a fun couple you are! (thunder crashing)   Ah, it's been a while since we've had a storm like this. I locked down all the windows. Nothing's getting in. Okay, water's getting in that one, that one's leaking. Bob, she might be trying to poison you! Yeah, Dad, do you have a d*ath wish? People don't put poison in pills. They put it in food or drinks. You know what would be great right now? Hot chocolate. (thunder crashes) Huh...? (sing-songy): Mini marshmallows! Would be nice right now, but I don't have any. You have a car. Oh, none for me, thanks. Yeah, sorry, we don't like hot chocolate, any of us. Mother, you do not speak for me. I didn't know I didn't like hot chocolate. Yeah, you don't. (gulping) I'll take theirs. I could drink a gallon of this stuff. It burned the crap out of my tongue, but I love it. Teddy's dead. He's friggin' dead! (grunts) Ow! Hey, these pain meds are starting to kick in. And my back is feeling A... oh, much better. Happy to help. I took a couple, and I'm right there with ya. Yeah. These are good. Oh, yeah. I'd take more. I always take more. So, Helen, sorry to hear about your late husband. Oh, yes, he was a good man. Good, good, good, good, good. Uh-huh. Good taste, too, huh? Well, he chose me. (laughs) Ow. Oh, no, I just meant those beautiful decorative boulders out back. So solid and jagged. Did Larry pick those out? Oh, no, I picked those out. Larry had the tackiest taste in boulders. So you picked those out. How interesting. Very interesting. Very interesting. Yeah. I guess. I don't think so. So, uh, Larry was quite the mountain climber, huh? Larry? No. No, I'm the climber. I had to drag him to all those mountains. Larry used to call me "Mount St. Helen." Which I don't get. Oh, so he wasn't a good mountain climber? Yeah, he wasn't good at all. Huh. Total klutz. That's so Larry. You know, you have such a lovely home, Helen. Looks like Larry left you very comfortable. Oh, no, he left nearly everything to charity. Oh. Hmm. Charity. Well, everything except this house. And the place in New York. And Aspen. I'll get by. Uh, you know what? I got to poop, and would anyone like to join me? Family meeting. Of course, Mother, I could poop. Come on, everyone! Bobby, you might not have to go, but I want you to try, honey. I can't move. I'm gonna stay here with Henry. Helen. My name is Bob. Okay, so she put in the boulders. That's guilty. Guilty as hell. All the more reason to get you kids out of here. But Larry was a klutz, So maybe he did just fall off his own roof. Wait. Didn't he leave all his money to charity? Right. True. But how do we know Helen's telling the truth about that? Well, whatever her deal is, let's get out of this beautiful d*ath house. And home to our hideous life house. Fine, but if anyone asks, we solved this thing, and we were brilliant. (thunder crashing) Ah, it's really coming down out there. The rain... it's an expression, I think. You get it. I totally get it. You know, you have a wonderful family. And Teddy. You have a wonderful family and Teddy. I can't believe Linda thinks that you k*lled your husband. (laughs) What? She does? Mm-hmm. (laughs) She does. She thinks you loosened the railing, and you pushed him onto the boulders. But she's crazy, and you're nice. It's really coming down out there. I got to use that. (laughs) That's a crazy expression. (snoring) Okay, we all pooped. Uh, Bob, let's hit the road. You know, Linda, I have a suspicion you didn't all go poop. What? Of course we did. Something smells, Linda, and it's not the bathroom. Teddy: Road's completely flooded. No one's getting in or out of here tonight. What? I guess it looks like you'll have to stay the night here. No. That's all right. We can swim home. Linda, I insist, and I always get my way. I'm very... pushy. I call couch! (snoring) So, do you still think Helen's a m*rder*r? Yes, I do, but if we're all gonna get k*lled, we may as well go out playing video games. Well, I think she's innocent. No, she's a man-eater, like Ms. Pac Man here. Ms. Pac Man eats ghosts and fruit! Don't bring her into this! Oh, Helen, me sleep in your room? On the floor though, right? Not on the floor? In the bed with you? Okay. Spooning? Sure. You want to be the big spoon? You want...? No, you want me to be the big spoon. Whoa, I hadn't thought of that. Okay, I'll take first watch. In a couple hours, we'll switch. Yeah, yup, you got it, Gene. I'm not Gene. I'm your wife Linda. Rub my face. No. Helen: Linda. Aah! Oh, I didn't see you there. 'Cause I snuck up on you. Come, take a walk with me. No, no. I'm pretty tired. Come, come. Mm. Mm. I'm grabbing your arm, you're walking with me. Here we go. (hatch creaking, wind howling) Why you want to come up here? I wanted to check in with you. You wanted to check in, huh, on the widow's walk? I did. Because your husband says you think I k*lled my husband. No, no, don't listen to him. He's-he's stoned out of his mind. I can tell by your face. (whimpers) And because you're backing away. (gasps) Every time I walk towards you. (whimpers) On the widow's walk. Helen. Where my husband died. Died, Larry. (sing-songy): Look who's here! The pool man! Rack 'em up, Gene. Pool's in session. Yay! It's loopy Dad! Am I talking funny? (slurring): Ahdo. Ahl. Ahourr. All right, let's play pool. Wait. Where's Mom? She went with Helen. Why? 'Cause Helen wanted to talk to her and be, like, "Why do you think I k*lled my husband?" Why would she be like that? 'Cause I told her Linda thinks she k*lled her husband. And why would you tell her that?! Because we're friends, Gene! Oh, my God. I got to find her! Okay, Helen, just stop moving, and I'll stop moving. (rolling thunder) Oh, Linda, be careful. You're standing almost exactly where Larry fell from. It's very slippery. Back off, sister! Wait. You were in the rose garden when you saw Larry fall, right? Mm, I was. I was so in the rose garden. Then why can't we see the rose garden from this very spot?! You can. It's right there. Oh, right, yeah. Pretty. (laughs) Linda, I didn't k*ll Larry. I loved Larry. Okay, I didn't love him, but I... but I liked him. I liked being married to him. Right, yeah, yeah. Okay, I didn't like being married to him, but I liked getting married to him. Yeah, sure. Okay, I didn't like our wedding day. It was a hard day. But the point is, I'm not a m*rder*r. I didn't k*ll him. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, I thought about k*ll*ing him. Who hasn't? But I didn't. I-I couldn't. Right, right. Okay, I could, but I didn't. Oh, sure, yeah. Because he died. Oh, God! Aah! Oh! Oh! You saved me. Of course I did. If I let you fall, they would think that I k*lled you, and I'm not going through that again. Well, thank you. I'm sorry for accusing you of m*rder. You definitely didn't do it? I definitely didn't do it. You didn't push him and then k*ll him? I didn't push anybody! All right. Well, give me huggies. Oh. Aah, I'm pushing you! Oh, my face! No, I'm just kidding. I'm kid... I'm just kidding. Oh. Ha, ha! Get away from my mom! Louise, no! She didn't do it! (yelling) Ow! My neck! So sharp! Oh! So sharp! (Louise grunting) Stop! Stop! Stop! Oh, boy! Get her off! Sorry! She won't let us cut her nails. (yelling) I'm so sorry, Helen. How many times do I have to tell you people? Helen is not a m*rder*r! I know, I know. She promised she didn't k*ll Larry. Now we're gal pals. Of course she didn't k*ll Larry! She's a great woman. And she's got interesting collar bones and a perfect forehead, and-and she's... I didn't mean to say all that. I... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! (overlapping shouting) Ow! Aah! That's the guest bedroom! Ow! Ooh! Other bedroom! Oh! I got to fix that shingle! Oh! Ow! Ground. Sweet ground. I'm alive, everyone! Teddy! You fell so far! And for so long! How are you alive? I fell on the floor, and I can barely walk. I guess you can just slip and fall off the roof. I fall off roofs all the time. Helen, your story checks out. I'm so glad you're okay. Did-did you mean that stuff you said up there? Uh, yeah? Well, I think you're great and have pretty good collarbones, and if you ever took off that hat, I bet you've got a forehead that goes all the way back. Aw. So sweet. Let's get you inside. Yeah. Hey, look... a mud box. Hey, Henry, I found something. I see you did. Some crappy tool box. I know why you buried this. You do? Because you didn't want Teddy to think you had tools, so he'd come over and fix stuff. Right. (sing-songy): Because you like him. I do. It's okay. I won't tell anybody about your secret tools. You know, I don't think you're gonna remember any of this anyway. Yeah. Let's go inside. We're not inside? Linda: So listen, honey, next time you're in town, you and, uh, Teddy come by, have dinner at the restaurant, on us. What? (laughs) Well, I'd like that very much. What kind of restaurant is it? Slop shop. Butt hut. It's nice. I am in. Perfect! I'll go there now and wait. What a wonderful little adventurecation! Oh, I hurt so much. Take it easy, k*ller! Ha! k*ller. Okay, see you soon! Helen, another pill. Be safe! Give me another pill. Here you go. Buh-bye! Bob: Thank you. Linda: Don't k*ll anyone! Nah, you got it! What a sweetheart. Ooh, let's go break into someone's lake house. Teddy:  I'm falling for Helen  And there's no tellin'  Just how far a fella can fall  For sure-fitted, strong-armed, wild-eyed widow like Helen  Buh, buh-dah-dah, buh-duh  There's no tellin'  Just how far a fella can fall  For a pill-poppin', home-wreckin'  Long-necked widow like Helen  Bah, bah-dah-dah, bump-ba  I'm falling for Helen...  Bah, da, bah-dah-dah, ba, bup... 
Hey, little guy, you're gonna become part of a great burger today. (high-pitched): I'm honored. What are you calling it? (normal voice): Jicama-Tah-Ta. (high-pitched): Great joke! No making the food talk, please. And you wonder why I'm the only one who'll go shopping with you. Dad, look! Wait, don't look now. Okay, now look. Where? There. Wh-What is it? Bob: An old Asian man? Louise: That's not an old Asian man. It's not? It's Hawk! Hawk? Hawk! From Hawk & Chick! Father, look out! The Jellyfish Monster! Thank you, Chick. (fierce yell)   Hi-yah! Father-daughter samurai team played by an actual father and daughter. It's like they based it on us. I know. We could sue. We won't, 'cause we love these movies. But yeah, that's us. But is he the right age? How old was he in his last movie? The one where they fight the giant butterfly? Yeah. Probably 40. And how old is that guy, a hundred? He's not a hundred. Well, you're 80, so he's got to be at least 90. What's he doing in our dumb town, anyway? Maybe he flies from Japan to buy our mushrooms? He's leaving the market. Should I shout his name? No. We should leave him alone. Or we could follow him. We kind of already are. This is weird. Let's go home, live our lives the best we can. I mean, we're poor, but we're happy. He's crossing the street! Move! Move! (horn beeps) Sorry. Thank you. Ooh! Sorry. Sorry. No! He's getting on a bus! Well, we're not getting on a bus to follow this guy. We should get off at the next stop. It's not him. Both (whispering): It's him! It's Rising Hawk. (low gasping) Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Where the hell are your father and your sister? They should be back by now. Maybe they're afraid to be around me. (grunts) 'Cause I'm on fire. (groans) Game, set, salt. Wow. She can't do long division, but the girl can slide a saltshaker. Who? Oh, me. I'm gonna say something. What are you gonna say? Say it to me like you're gonna say it to him. Okay, all right. Um, hi, Mr. Kojima... Terrible. What? Ugh! Bad. Right, right, right. Not ready. Not ready.   (elevator bell dings) Fourth floor. Yeah. Stairs. Let's go. (whispering): Wait, this is crazy. What's our plan? Um, get him to sign your jicama? I don't... I don't have a pen. (all yell) Why are you follow me? Aah! (both screaming) (laughs) Joking! Joking! Oh. Oh, that-that's good. Y-You got us. Did I get you? Yeah, very much. (chuckles) My little heart is beating so fast. (laughs) (laughs): Yeah. I dropped my jicama. Uh, so... Shinji Kojima? Please, call me Kojima... or Koji. Just don't call me if I owe you money. (laughs) I owe people money. Uh, uh, my name is Bob. Uh, and this is my daughter, Louise. We've seen all your movies. Am I screeching? I feel like I'm screeching a little. Yes. Sorry, you're kind of a big deal for us. It's nice to get recognized. We were wondering... why are you in our town? Did you get lost? Lots of people are here because they got lost. Not lost. Just looking... Okay. Wait, what-what does that mean? You kind of trailed off there. I have, uh, said too much. So, do you know a good place to eat? Yes! Uh, we have a restaurant. No, no, no, no! It's not good! It's really good. It's not good enough for Koji, Dad! Is it good or not good? Good. Not good. Good. Oh, not good. Mmm! Good. Wow, so that's how celebrities chew their food. I was all wrong. Celebrity Chewing! I'd watch that show. Tina, take another picture of me with Koji. Let's do one where we're laughing at a hilarious thing I just said. But it's so smart you don't get it for a second, and then you do. Hmm. Mmm? Oh, now I get it. (laughing) Oh, he just got it. He just got it. When I'm famous, I'll have a handler whose only job will be to keep people like Mom away from me. And Mom, too, maybe. What? Just kidding. You know you'll live in my trailer. I want a copy of that one. Oh, we don't print our photos. They live in the camera. Guys, here it is! All the Hawk & Chicks we recorded from TV. We've got a lot to choose from. Hawk & Chick versus Sharkman or the classic Hawk & Chick versus Tsukumogami. What's a Tsukumogami? Um, it's just an object that comes to life every hundred years. Oh! And in this case, it's a tree. So, they fight a tree? Cool. Well, there's more to it than that, Tina. It's about a barber and his daughter traveling from village to village, trying to avoid trouble... But trouble always finds them. And then they kick trouble's ass! Am I right? Looking at you, Koji. (mouth full): Looking back at you, Louise. Wait, so these movies are about traveling barbers who fight weird Japanese monsters? So, it's like a less s*xual Incredible Hulk? (crowd clamoring) Hmm? That's not a tree. That's a monster. (both yelling) This is amazing. We're watching a Hawk & Chick with Hawk! I know, and he must be excited 'cause he's watching it with us. Or not. He's crying. Oh. (yelling) Everything okay, Kojima? No. Not okay. The reason I'm in your town is to find my Yuki. Is that Japanese for getting your groove back? No. It is English for getting my daughter back. Yuki? Your daughter lives here? Yes, she does. I haven't gathered the courage to speak to her. I haven't spoken to Yuki in 30 years. (all gasp) Hawk and Chick haven't spoken in 30 years?! What the hell? She chose to move to America with her mother after we divorced. Our relationship was strained because I strained it. Now Yuki is... an accountant. Both: What?! Oh, nice. I've come all this way, but I worry Yuki doesn't want to see me. Eh, what's 30 years? I got underwear older than that. You two will be sword-fighting together in no time. We've got to make this samur-ight! Whoa! I've got a great idea you're all gonna hate. Family conference. Don't worry. Doesn't seem rude. No, no. Maybe all we need to do is get Yuki to see her dad as Hawk again. Up on the big screen! Okay, but how do we do that? I'm really enjoying this huddle. One of the best huddles ever. It's all right. Guys, this is the part you're gonna hate. We got to put on a Hawk & Chick film festival and convince them both to go. Reunion! Boom! You hate it, you hate it. I don't hate it. I like it. I love it. I love it, too. (all yell) Oh! You snuck in the huddle! I am out of ketchup. But I am in for the festival. (all cheer)  Samurai festival of love.  So, you want me to let you guys take over the theater for the entire weekend for a marathon of some obscure samurai movies from the '70s. Is that right? Yup. So we're good here? Not gonna happen. But the stars of the movies are gonna be there. Most likely. Well, one is for sure. Point is they're gonna reunite in front of all their fans! Father and daughter together again... What-what are you doing? Oh, this? Nothing. Keep talking. Can you still hear me? It's a little crack now. I'm just gonna close this down, and bye! Great. Thank you. Thank you! Come on, Louise. Let's go. Psst. Hey. (clicks tongue) Me. I'm talking. Is Shinji Kojima really in town? And Yuki? Yeah! Wait, so you know the Hawk & Chick movies? I love them! Lots of people do. If you did a Hawk & Chick film festival, people would definitely show up. So, can you talk your boss into letting us use this theater? No. We've had bad experiences doing film festivals. We had a Meg Ryan film festival, and this place was disgusting afterwards. Oh, well, we tried. Thanks. Wait, wait, wait. You can do the festival here. We just got to be sneaky. Like a coyote. Oh, I like the sound of this. Listen, the last show on Saturday night lets out at 11:00. Once my manager drives off, the theater's ours. It'll be a secret, one night only, midnight screening of a Hawk & Chick movie. Okay, we'll do it. Yes! Thanks, Dominic. You're all right. So which Hawk & Chick movies do you have prints of? "Prints"? Yeah, you know, a print? Thing that goes in the projector? Makes pictures on the screen? Oh, we don't have one of those. No, we just thought we could bring our VHS tapes and just fast-forward through the commerci... Okay, I realize how terrible that sounds. Hmm, maybe I can find one. All right, you know, I'll poke around on some film forums. You're lucky I was planning to go online today. Linda: Ooh, exciting! An illegal samurai film festival! I like all those words! Now all we need is a movie. And we got to convince Yuki to want to reunite with her father, who she might hate. And we need flyers! But how do we advertise a secret film screening? Psst. You like movies? Yeah, I like movies. Are you cool? What do you mean? Forget it! Keep moving. How's it going? Some of these people seem cool, but they're not! How can you tell? You can tell. So, uh, trash can? No. I think we owe it to an old Japanese man and his middle-aged daughter to see this through. Wow, that just got me. Let's try the quad at the community college. There's two things those honkys love... foreign films and flyers telling them where other honkys will be! Well, this is the address Kojima gave us. That's her! That's Chick! It's so gross to see her behind a desk. She should be slicing up the Snow Monster or the Six-Headed Sumo! God, idiot! Please don't call her an idiot to her face. Just get it out now. Idiot! Idiot! Idiot! All right, let's go get Yuki to say yes to the fest. No. What? Look, I haven't even thought about those movies in years. Okay, okay, we're giving you a chance to feel like a movie star again. You can see yourself up on the big screen instead of staring at that number screen on your desk there. I'm very happy as an accountant. No, you're not. I am. You're depressed. No, I'm not. You didn't let me finish! "...ing" me. Depressing me! Louise? I mean, who makes 14 amazing movies with their dad, and then just walks away one day?! Who does that, Yuki? Louise, stop. Who does that?! Louise? I'm sure it wasn't easy working with your dad all those years. I-I know. I get it. I've been there. Wrong. Wrong! Working with your dad is fun. I mean working with your dad was fun. Because he was a samurai and you k*lled monsters! Yuki, um, can we have a minute, please? Look, Louise, she obviously doesn't want to reconnect with her father. We should call off the screening. What? No way! We need to get her butt into that theater so she can apologize to Koji. I think it's more like Kojima needs to apologize to Yuki for driving her away. Yuki didn't want his life, Louise! So we're in agreement. We're not gonna tell her that her dad's here! Wait. What? We're gonna trick her. We are? Shh, shh, shh! Here she comes. So, about that film festival... can we put you down as a "yes"? I'm not so sure. Yuki, Yuki, come on, Yuke. Just say yes. Imagine a packed theater of your adoring fans all there for you! Just you, no Hawk. It'll be Chick's night. (loud gasping) We love you, Yuki! Ah! Ah! What is...? She's doing a... like, a lot of people cheering, but it sounds more like a ghost. Well, you do it, Dad. Can you do it. I guess that could be fun. All right, what the hell. I'll go. Great! Great! So you got her to come? Both: Yup. That's great. Mm-hmm. Did you use my icebreaker? Pretend to rob the place? No. Did you file for an extension on your taxes? No, Tina. That's a myth. You can't do that. Well, how does Yuki feel about seeing her father? We might not have told her that her dad was gonna be there. On purpose by accident. What? Yup. Nice. You tricked her! Yup. I'm not sure you can trick people into reuniting. Not true. That's how they got Mel Gibson and Danny Glover back together for Lethal Weapon 3. Yeah, I read that. This is gonna work, people. Yuki's gonna see Hawk & Chick up on the big screen, get all weepy like Koji did, and realize how crazy she's been, and we're gonna be heroes, and we're gonna be invited to the premiere of their next movie in Japan! Ooh, I got to get a passport. Guess who got the print. Me! I freaking love this guy! Dominic! Ah, come here. Which one is it? Hawk & Chick versus Seaweed Monster. Ooh, Seaweed Monster, scary! Only thing... it's an original 35 millimeter print from Japan. That's incredible. No, I mean, original, vintage. It's not dubbed in English. It's not even subtitled. Oh. Yeah. Well, so, can't you just whip up some English subtitles? Oh, sure. Yeah, I'll just add some words to the screen. What do you think this is, future world? I have an idea... not about this. Okay, wait. No, I got one about this, too. I have, like, six ideas. The third one's about this. Dubbing it ourselves? Great idea. Thanks, Gene. Guys. All right, I typed up all the subtitles from Hawk & Chick versus Seaweed Monster. Did you guys know about spell check? It's amazing. It tells you if you misspell something. I mean, it's... Some of it is open to interpretation. But, you know, it's helpful. Here's everyone's parts. How many characters are you playing? Three. Ah, three's good. I'm doing four characters, but I guess, you know, I'm more experienced. But I've got a lot of lines because I'm the mayor. You're the mayor?! Bob, she's the mayor?! Lin, it doesn't matter. Tina, Tina, let me be the mayor. Back off. Let's dub, people! Rub a dub dub! (rhythmic clicking)   Bob: It has been many days since we have loaned you our lantern. Can we have it back now? Gene: Yes. I see you are returning the lantern with less lantern oil than when I lent it to you. Also, the wick is in need of replacement. Lot of lantern talk. There's always a lot of lantern talk. You get into it. Already there. As the mayor of this village... As the mayor of this village... Mom, back off. Seriously. All right, don't forget, secret screening, so we cannot look like a line! The manager's gonna come out pretty soon and go home. We're just 40-some-odd people who happen to be standing here. So, look at your phones or up at the sky and whistle or something. Oh. Okay. Like this? Great. Wait, wait. Too many shoe tie-ers, One of you hail a cab. Taxi! What do I do? Commit, commit, get in, circle the block. Hello. Right this way, talent. I can't believe I agreed to this. Are those from my rose bush? Shh, shh. Tonight, you're a celebrity again. You don't have a worry in the world. Well, I'm worried about my roses. They're fine. They're fine. They're resilient! Linda: Hi, Yuki! Belcher family limo at your service! You'll notice a bottle of water on your seat. That's for you, because celebrities gets thirstier than normal people. The cheese sticks hidden in the seat... uh, those are not for you. I will now put up the privacy divider for the remainder of your ride. (imitates window whirring up) (mutters) Okay, he's gone. Get 'em in! Get 'em in! Oh, crap, they're early! Aw, crap, we're early! They can't see each other yet! I know! First Yuki's got to watch the movie, feel bad and want to repair their relationship! I know! Our perfect plan! Flawless! We got to get him inside! Koji, come on. But I am giving Kevin an autograph. Ugh. Forget Kevin. Inside, now, let's go! Gene! Privacy screen! Get in there! Ah! Aah! Ow! Aah! You need privacy! Be private! We got to move! Let's move! Ow, you hit me. That was... Kevin. Kevin, get away! Get away, Kevin! (as Kevin): Ah, you got me away! Watch out for the... Ugh! Ow! Okay, privacy's over. You had some you time. Thanks. Okay, we'll come and get you when it's about to start! Wait. Why can't I go in now? Yeah, just relax and enjoy the green room. Sorry it's not actually green, or a room. You may have one cheese stick! Okay, just sit here and be quiet. And keep the jacket on your head till the movie starts. It's very cold in here. Okay. Got it. No problem. Enjoy the movie, lady! You're in it! And here's some tissues. They're good for when something life-changing happens. All right, here we go. Linda: It was a time in Japan when evil monsters would attack nice little villages for no good reason. And the only force in all of Japan who could stop them... Hawk & Chick! Bob (as Hawk): There's a village up ahead. Maybe there's hair that needs cutting. Louise: And hopefully, no monsters that need defeating. This is amazing! I know! We're incredible. We really are. Tina: Oh, no, seaweed monster! You're ruining my haircut, and I'm the mayor! Aah! (grunting) (grunting) Seaweed monster, let me go! So, you loving the movie? No. Not really. It's kind of painful? Uh-huh. You want some popcorn? Sure. It is finally dead. Father! It's not all dead! (low, distorted): Part of it still wishes to fight. That's not how I sound. Is that how I sound? No! Oh, God, I think the batteries are dying! But we put new batteries in this morning! How could this happen? Fast-forward! Rewind! Fast-forward! Rewind! Fast-forward! Rewind! Well, it's not that bad. Maybe no one will notice. (low and garbled): Let's send this thing back to the... Okay, that's really bad. We got to do something! There's a mic. I think we got to wing it. Good thing we've seen this movie a thousand times. Aah! Aah! No longer will you terrorize this town, Seaweed Monster. We are going to weed you out! Crap, we need the villagers! Lin! Lin! Psst! We need you guys up here. What? Come here! Hurry! Which way did the Seaweed Monster go? That way! No, that way! Gene: Aah! Monster! Green! Green! Aah! Aah! I can't do this. Oh, God, she's leaving! Yuki's leaving! Oh, I forgot to tell you, your plan's not working. She's having a terrible time. She told me. I thought the popcorn would make her feel better, but it didn't. Hang on, it's my line. Don't hurt me. I'm the mayor. Don't hurt me. I'm the mayor. Mom! Louise: Damn it, Yuki, you're k*ll*ing me! What do we do? What do we do?! Bob: Wait. Yuki, don't go! Huh? I mean, Chick. I know we're fighting this Seaweed Monster right now, but I want you to know how much I love and support you, even if you decide... Hold on. Hiya! Aah! ...to stop fighting monsters with me someday and... do taxes instead. Tina: And, Hawk, I want you to know... hiya!... if that ever happens, it's me who should apologize for leaving! 'Cause I would be dumb to do that. I don't remember this part. Are the actors really bad? Yes. They're horrible. Bob: No! Smash this house! Chick doesn't need to apologize for anything! Chick was just a kid! And I hit this guy! But... but... how could a father and daughter not talk for 30 freaking years?! Whoa. Seaweed Monster suddenly thinks this might be about something else. And I'm squeezing you. Sorry about that. Am I gonna turn into someone completely different someday? Is that what happens when you grow up? You... you grow apart? Listen, what happened to Hawk and Chick will never happen to us. This Hawk and this Chick will never not talk for 30 years. You promise? Yes, of course, Louise. I mean, Chick. Foreign films are so much more complex than Hollywood movies. (growls) I'm the monster again. Aah, I'm getting stabbed. I'm getting... I exploded. I'm not sure why I... I explo... I'm dead. I'm gone. Koji, talk to her. To who? To Yuki. My Yuki. Yuki, it's... it's your father speaking. Dad? What are you doing here? You said he wasn't gonna be here. You tricked me. Uh, surprise. Yuki, please, I've come all this way to tell you I miss you. I am sorry for everything. I have not been a good father. Oh, she's thinking about it. I love you, little Chick. Oh, Dad. Oh, he got her. He got her. (crying): We did it. We did it. (applauding) Wow, that ended up working way better than I thought it would. Eh, it went about exactly the way I thought it would. So I should get you kids home, right? What time is it? It's after midnight. Is it a school night? Yes, and I have a big test tomorrow. It's, like, half my grade. Oh, sorry.

Take the Hawk & Chick box set home to your village.
(people complaining) Bob: Everybody, please! Everybody, let's try to settle down. I mean, a rent hike?  Now? Come on! Fischoeder's out of his freaking mind. What are we supposed to do, jack up the price of yarn? There'll be riots! Again! I'm starting to think Mr. Fischoeder just became a landlord for the money. (people murmuring) Everyone, can I... can I have your attention? Silence! Yeah, tubby's talking! Mr. Fischoeder has raised our rent before, but this new hike is the biggest ever. None of us can afford it. Except for me, right, son? What? Ah, never mind. What? Never mind. I told Mr. Fischoeder we were coming to see him today, but what he doesn't know is if he goes ahead with this rent hike, we're gonna give him a rent strike! Yeah! A what? A rent strike. It means if Mr. Fischoeder tries to raise the rent, we'll stop paying it. Oh, that might make him mad, Bobby. Yeah, landlords hate stuff like that. Exactly. It's the only leverage we have against a guy as big as Fischoeder. (people murmuring) (quietly): You sure you want to be the ringleader on this, Bob? You know, it could be better to talk to him one-on-one. He's not our friend, Lin, he's our landlord. We have to show him we mean business. Mmm, Bobby Business over here. I like Bobby Business. Okay, Bob, we're in. (cheering) Yay, Bobby, you're going on a rent strike! Just like in Rent. Uh, I don't think that's what happens in Rent. No, yeah, that's what happens. Andy: Now you smile. (grunts) Now you smile. (grunts) Now you smile. (grunts) Now you smile. (grunts) Stop it, stop it. Did we really have to bring our kids? Did you really have to wear that tie? It's important to show Fischoeder that we're not just doing this for ourselves. Some of us have families. Aw, I love kids. Which is ironic, 'cause they're not allowed in my store. I-I run a s*x shop, everybody. If we haven't met, I'm Sal. Pervert. Hey, Sal. Uh, yeah. Uh, thanks for coming, Sal. Remember, everybody, stick to the script. Rent hike, rent strike. Oh, look! I thought I heard the pitter-patter of little tenant feet. Everyone, have a welcome mojito! Wow, mojitos. This is going good, Bobby. Mojito, Bob? Uh, not for me, thanks. Oh, nonsense. It's mojito weather. I don't want a-a mojito. Linda, mojito? Sure! Attagirl. Mr. Fischoeder, we've prepared a few words for you. Just, um, give me a second. I'm gonna... put the mojito down. Oh, well, that's a safe place to put it. (clears throat) The dictionary defines "rent" as a... This is an old draft. Uh, let me just skip ahead. Here we go. It was Gandhi who said... Let me stop you right there, Bob... Gandhi would want me to. You're here to tell me that if I raise the rent, you'll have a rent strike. How did you know? Whenever tenants get together in these little clumps, you come up with the same idea. Well, it's true... if you raise the rent, we're, um, we're gonna strike. Right, everyone? (shouting affirmatively) Oh, but, Bob, and, uh, loyal, uh... Bob-ists? Bob-ites? Whatever you want to call yourselves. I'm here to tell you there's another way. Another way? Yes. Carnies? I don't get it. A water balloon fight! Excuse me? I said a water balloon fight. It's how we settle worker disputes on the wharf. Well, that and freestyle rap battles. You may use the entire grounds of my estate, from the garden I ignore to the field in the back where I dump the old rides. Uh, I don't think that's gonna happen. If you get hit, you're out. And that means your rent is going up. Listen, Mr. Fi... B-But for the lucky winner who manages to stay dry, your rent gets cut in half. (all gasping) Man: All right! I could use that money... to buy things. Now, what do you say? (chuckles nervously) N-No. We came here to stand together, not... Hold on, now. If any member of my family wins, my rent goes down? Yes. Children flank their parents in battle just like in the good old days. Oh, so people with kids have an unfair advantage. Would you call that an advantage? Giddyup! (shouts) I'm okay. Mr. Fischoeder, we're not doing your water balloon fight. We're standing together. Right? Here's how we're gonna do this. You grab as many balloons as you can, find cover, and at the sound of my pistol, start ballooning. Every man for himself! Go! Jimmy, what are you doing?! I'm getting 50% off my rent! Don't move, Bob! Stay where I can balloon ya! No. No, stand together. Rent hike means rent strike! Linda, wait. Guys! Teddy? I'm with you, Bobby. I'm just gonna get a balloon real quick, 'cause everyone else is getting balloons. Rent hike means rent... (screams) No...! Oh, but the g*n says yes. Kids, stay away from the water balloons! Oh, right, Dad, like you can just tell kids, "Stay away from the water balloons." Sorry, Bob. Tenant clump un-clumped. Now it's every h*nky for himself. Everyone, focus. Fischoeder is using this to divide us. People, if we play his game, there are many losers and only one winner. Reggie: And that winner's gonna be me! Reggie, no. Sorry, Bob. I'm always the doormat, but not this time. I'm gonna win this thing and... Ah, come on. Gotcha. That was for you, Bob. Ah, geez. Am I out? I'm out. Good throw, Zeke. Thanks, J-Ju. So do we have an alliance? Hell yeah. I'm the Katniss to your Pita Bread. Carnies, seize them! Wha...? What are you...? Help! I'll never forget you, Bob! Where are they taking them? To the porch of losers. When you're hit, you go up on the porch and watch the rest of the competition and have snacks. Ooh, snacks. Snacks? Teddy! Teddy: Eh? What kind of snacks? Uh, cheese and French bread. Ooh. Little shrunken pickles. You're missing out. Oh, my God, I'm so hungry. Dad, you got to take cover. You're a high-value target in a low-value body. All right, Gene and I will form a strike team and go soak some suckers. This is one wet T-shirt contest we don't want to win. No, kids, you're not doing that. You guys stay close while I talk to the tenants and get them back together. And... they're gone. Don't worry, Dad. You still have me and Mom. We're like the Secret Service, Bob. We'll never leave your side. I'm just gonna get a few little shrunken pickles. Mom, no. Oh, right, right, right. (people shouting) People, you're being dumb! I'm sorry to be harsh, but it's tough love. "Tough love," aka "love." Am I right? I'm with you, Bob. This is madness. Yes, thank you, Sal! We got to stay together, like batteries and the things I sell at my store that need the batteries. Great, Sal. Thanks. Fischoeder (over megaphone): Oh, Bob's getting his little club back together. Start with the porno guy, that's what they always say. Where's that coming from? By the way, if you need more balloons, I've hidden buckets around the garden. Let's just say one of these trees bears big, wet, jiggly fruit. Uh, apple tree! Pineapple! Raisin tree! No guessing from the porch of losers. Look, it's Harold and Edith. Whoa, that tree house is nicer than our house. That tree is nicer than our house. Okay, you hit Edith, I'll hit Harold, then we'll climb up and see how rich squirrels live. Ready? Hi-ya! Man, that old prune can throw a balloon. There's more where that came from, baby! Harold, defend the perimeter! Huh? Wha...? Oh, all right. (grunts) Retreat! Retreat! Bob. What? I got an idea. We can use my bra as a balloon launcher. Linda, no, we're not throwing balloons. Also, that idea is not good. I think it's genius. It's not genius. Sure, it is! A bazonga bazooka! Ha! Listen, we got to find a protected spot where we can reason with the tenants without getting hit. Dad, look. Fischoeder: Oh! It looks like Bob the rat has found the hedge maze. Ugh, he's watching us. We're going somewhere else! Not the hedge maze! Don't listen to him! He's in the hedge maze! Watch your step, Bob. I have a suspicion our maid has been tossing the garbage in there instead of walking it to the curb. You hear that? Inga? Tina (quietly): Jimmy Jr. And Zeke. You guys keep going. I'll take care of these two. All right, but be careful, Tina. I was born careful. Remember? You were there. Damn, J-Ju. We're out of balloons in a balloon fight... worst time to be out of balloons. Yeah. Where's that balloon bucket? Tina: Boys. Tina! (screams) No balloons, huh? I have one. But there are two of you. Hmm. Tina, girl, just let us go. Yeah, let us go! I could. Or I could throw my balloon at you, Zeke... (gasps) ...and spend some time alone with Jimmy Jr. In this romantic/creepy hedge maze. That'd be okay, yeah. Hold up now, girl. Hold up! Uh, you, uh... you know I like you, right? What? I said I like you. A lot. I'm up to my butt in it, T-bird. Come on! Huh. Hell, J-Ju takes you for granted. Zeke! Sorry, J-Ju, it's the truth. Tina, wh-what are you doing? I was just about to ask you on a romantic date! Bull feces! Okay, Jimmy Jr., if I agreed to go on a date with you, where would you take me? Um, to, uh... to... the drugstore. Ugh. Zeke, can you do better than the drugstore? Do what? Do better than the drugstore! Uh, tacos, then to the touch tank at the aquarium. Check out the octopuses. Get tacos again. Maybe wash it down with some-something to drink. All sorts of good stuff, girl. Jimmy Jr.? Your move. Uh... I-I... Just so you guys know, I'm not enjoying this. It's very stressful. But let's keep going. We're out in the open, kids. Ready to shield Daddy? Front shield! Back shield! Great. Great. I, uh... I love you. Yay! Yay! Shh! Listen, I don't know if anyone can hear me, but we can still turn this around. We just have to stop fighting each other. Jimmy (mocking): Me, me, me, me, me, me, fighting each other. (mumbling) Ugh. Jimmy. Hey, uh, sorry this isn't working out for you, pal. Yeah, well, it could still work out, Jimmy. I convinced Sal to stop playing. Oh, Sal, you in there? Yeah. Well, wait, uh, you don't want to win half off your rent? Don't listen to him, Sal. Guys in your line of work are hurting. Are we ever. Damn lnternet. (groans) Nowadays, people only come into a s*x shop if you give 'em a "boutique experience." Pshh. Jazz music playing. Oh... Huh. They want clean floors now. Oh, disgusting! Poor Sal. Boy, you really need to win this thing, huh? Sal, you see what he's doing, right? No. Oops. I, uh, gently dropped a water balloon on the grass, and it's rolling under the hedge to you, Sal. That's weird. (quietly): Throw it at Bob. Throw it at Bob. Don't pick it up, Sal. Come on, kids. Throw it at Bob. JIMMY/ANDY/OLLIE: Throw it at Bob. Throw it at Bob! Huh! Sal... Throw it at Bob! Eh! Throw it at Bob! Huh! Uh-oh, we're losing him. Throw it at Bob! Eh! Throw it at Bob! (slow motion): Sal, no...! (grunts) (shouts) (sobbing): I'm sorry, Bob and Linda! Linda, are you okay? You blocked that with your face. Yeah. My whole face flashed before my eyes. What is wrong with you people?! They're not listening, Bob. So screw 'em. You got to fight. And I'm gonna have some snacks. (grunting) Lin, what are you doing? The bazonga bazooka... use it. I... don't think I will. Bob, listen carefully! You put a balloon in each cup. Pull it back like a slingshot. No, I get it. Aim it slightly up! It's not that complicated. I love you, Bobby. Good luck! She's right. Screw these people. Good news, Mr. Fischoeder! You got me in your balloon fight! And I'm gonna win it! You hear that?! I heard most of it... I can't always understand your accent. I don't have an acc... I... Never mind! Anyway I'm gonna win! I'm playing the game! Is this what you people wanted? Huh? Huh?! Come on out! May I propose an alliance? Ha! You could've just said no. Fischoeder: Attaboy, Bob! That's the wrong size for you, Dad. But a good color. (gasps) Did Mom tell you to take her bra and use it as a balloon launcher? Yes. How did you know that? Mom and I have talked through this scenario dozens of times. Take it. I-I don't really want it. Wish me luck, kids! Yeah, okay, luck! Come on, Gene. We're going back to the tree house to take out a couple of old coots. We've got superior firepower. Superior and padded for comfort! "How do you know when it's the right time to kiss a girl?" Uh, at breakfast, in the afternoon, in the jungle, when you're married, and at the doctor's. Great answer. Whew, that was tough. Ugh, how long do we have to play this game, Tina? Until I make my decision. Well, it's getting boring! Maybe you just made my decision for me. Uh-oh! You know what? I'm gonna back away. And if you're gonna throw it, go ahead. (grunting) Don't walk away. It's not walking. It's dancing. It's walking! It's a backward dancy strut. Don't make me do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Damn it, Jimmy! (grunts) Whoops. Ha-ha! It's my turn now. Uh-oh, Tina! Why'd you say all that stuff, Zeke? Why'd you tell Tina I've had work done? It's not true! Oh, like you were born with that nose. You're the one with the perfect lips! Where'd you get those?! Hey, I have an idea. Why don't you throw it at Tina, and we'll be friends again. No, I'm not sure I like that idea. Hey, look, a hedge! Bye! I think we were all winners here. Aah! I'm afraid of heights! You're on the first step. You look like an ant from here! Why do you think they want to get up there so bad? You want the high ground in a balloon fight. Edith would know that. She fought the dinosaurs. Come on, help me tie Mom's bra to a tree. Then let's tie my underwear to a bird. Get back on that ladder, Harold. You're not having a heart attack. You've never had a heart attack. I did once. That was a stroke, if you could even call it that, you big baby. Okay, ready for launch. This is it. Let's make "Double D" stand for doused and dampened. Oh! Aah! Damn! Wow. I did not expect that to work. Wait till the Army hears about this. (both grunting) (gasps) It's everything we've ever wanted! Can we get our mail here? Tree mail! Tree cable! Uh, hello? Felix? Do you live here? Uh, yes. My brother kicked me out of the main house because I have sleep apnea, and sleep fartnea. (gasps) Look! Balloons! Of course! "One of these trees bears wet, jiggly fruit." That is a weird thing to say. Oh, my God, balloons! Let's play! Bob: Kids? Bob: Kids?! Dad? Good, you got the high ground! Okay, wait for my signal. We're gonna pound these punks! Whoa. Who's the new guy? (laughing)  Would you like to ride  In my beautiful balloon?  Would you like to glide in my beautiful balloon?  We could float among the stars together, you and I  Oh, we can fly  Yeah, we can...    Linda: (gasps) It's Bobby and Tina! It's just the Belchers and the Pestos now. Go, Bobby, go! Ooh, salami! Who catered this? Jimmy, come out. This ends now! (grunts) Tina! Hey, you broke my balloon! (chuckles) Well, at least it was fair and square. In my back when I wasn't looking. Give up, Bob. I've got more balloons than you, and I've got boy shields. Hi, Louise and Gene and Tina's Dad! Back shield, ease up on my throat! Sorry! (coughs) You may have boy shields, Jimmy, but I have boy and girl snipers! I said... (loudly): I have boy and girl snipers! These are dolls and a tree house for the dolls to play in. Mmm. Oh, whoa, whoa, careful, please. They're made to look like antiques. Bob: Snipers! sh**t him! Oh, crap. Oh, they're too far away. Mom's bra doesn't have that kind of range. I guess Mom's never really had to launch her boobs very far. Uh, do you want to use this maybe? Uh, yeah! Why do you have this? It's how I send my dirty laundry over to the main house. Load it up! Quick! (cackling) Ha! You only got my kids, idiots! All right, Bob... Wait. Good-bye kiss! Good-bye kiss! Oh, God. Okay, okay, okay, go, go, go, go! Let's see if you can dodge this. Son of a b1tch! Sorry, Dad. Yeah, sorry. (grunting) All right, all right. Easy now, easy now. Uh, Bob? What's the problem? Yeah, quit hot-dogging and do it already. This is the last balloon. Yes, yes, yes. Get to it, you grandstanding foreigner. No, I have the last balloon. That means the game doesn't end till I say it does. You all have to listen to me! Ha-ha! We were gonna work together, but no! You wanted to play this stupid game, and now you all lose! Oh, someone's a sore winner. What made me think people coming together could accomplish anything? People are the worst! Coming together is the worst! Are you finished yet? No! As long as I have this balloon, you will hear me! I will be heard! Damn it. Well, let's call that a tie. How about this? New game. Everybody get Bob. What? That's right. Each time anyone hits Bob with a balloon, they get $50 off their rent, and, uh, Bob gets $50 added. What?! How do I win? Uh, uh, you have to... last until sundown. That's when the game ends. And lnga and I watch World's Craziest Car Chases. Ready, everyone? Wait! No, no, no, no, no! Bob, you have ten seconds to run. Ten, nine, eight, six, one. Go! (Bob screaming) Help! Leave Bob alone! (panting) This is how they want to play it? (grunting) Felix, do you have any more dirty clothes? How dirty we talking? Wow me. Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! (Bob screaming) I'll try to keep this briefs. (all yelling) (grunts) Go, Bob! Go! (Bob yelling) Whoa. Man (in distance): I'm gonna look over here! Oh, I got to hide. (grunting) Woman: Where are you? Man: Got a balloon for you. Wow, Dad might just make it through this thing. It's almost sundown. It's almost sundown? I didn't bring my evening face cream. Where do you think Dad is hiding? (creaking) And did that pig just fart? Hi, Dad. You farted. (quietly): It was the seat. Go away! Get in the pig with you? You got it. No, you guys are gonna draw attention. I can win this thing if I just lay low for another 20 minutes. So you're saying we better get comfortable? (grunting) Bob: No, no, no, no! Bob? You over there, buddy? It's not safe here. I have to make a run for it. Dad, running's not your thing. Do you have a plan that involves standing around all the time? You're right. Dad can't move very well. Thanks, Tina. But maybe we can move Dad. Push harder! (grunting) Yes. That's great! That could work! He's over there! Get him! Bob? Oh, God. Oh, God. Back off, you maniacs! Leave my Bobby alone! Step aside, Linda. Make me, Reggie! Come on, sandwich man, you want to dance?! Get back! That pig up there is our father! And our dad's in there! We didn't come this far to not throw balloons at Bob. Move, please. Okay. You know what? Fine. You want to win money off your rent? Be my guest. Uh, Linda? It's over, Bob. You're getting ballooned. What do you got, 50 balloons? A hundred? That sounds high. Our rent's gonna be nuts. We'll go out of business, live in a box. You kids are gonna have to work in factories. I want to work at C&C Music Factory! Linda, what are you doing? Zip it, Bob! You had it coming after everything you did. You brought everyone together, looked out for 'em, stood up for what's right. Oh, I see what you're doing. Go ahead, destroy everything this family's worked for. Oh, goodie! I'm just in time. Looks like Bob is about to be ballooned. Direct hits only, people. No splash, no cash. Horrible aim. What's wrong with you people? Must be a case of mass butterfingers. We're standing with Bob. Yeah, just like before, but this time for real. Right, Jimmy? Ah, I wanted to throw a balloon at Bob. It's fine. I'll throw something at him later. Maybe a meatball. Thanks, everyone. Rent hike, rent strike! All (chanting): Rent hike, rent strike! Oh, I get it. Just because I'm a landlord, and I wear a white suit and an eye patch, and I raise your rent and ride around and throw firecrackers at you, I'm the bad guy. Well, landlords have problems. Landlords have problems. So long. (pedal clicking) (groans) See? My golf cart loses its charge just like yours. Oh. Mr. Fischoeder, I-I just realized something. Is... is it okay if I sit? Mm. People are staring. Mr. Fischoeder, before I got all these people together, maybe I should have come to you first and talked to you one-on-one. Mm. I should have given you a chance to be the good guy. Mm. I've known you a long time, and I just realized now I might have... hurt your feelings. Here's the thing, Bob. I like you. You're good people, sort of. You don't have to say "sort of." And I've always thought of myself as the kind of landlord you could pal around with. Someone you could pat on the butt as a sign of affection. That would... I... I would do that. No, but don't touch me. The truth is, Bob, I was only raising the rent so you would notice me. Really? No. I wanted a pool. You can't get chicks with a hedge maze. Sure. Makes sense. Bob, I've reconsidered. Maybe I could postpone the pool and the rent hike for a year or two. (cheering) You'll be out of business by then, Bob, don't worry. Thank you, Mr. Fischoeder. I know exactly how we should celebrate. (excited shouting) (laughs) Don't hit my pants! I'm wearing white. You'll see the outline of my wiener. Oh, what the hell. Fire away!
